WEBVTT

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.887
For fuck's sake, Cartwright. Not now.

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:13.472
Here, give me your phone.

00:00:13.555 --> 00:00:15.057
Give me your phone!

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:16.140
- Phone.
- For what?

00:00:16.225 --> 00:00:17.809
Just give me your phone.

00:00:18.727 --> 00:00:19.853
Where's Harper?

00:00:21.021 --> 00:00:22.940
- What the fuck? Who's th--
- Hey. Phone.

00:00:23.023 --> 00:00:23.982
- My phone?
- Your phone!

00:00:24.066 --> 00:00:25.651
Fuck off. I FaceTime my kids on this.

00:00:25.734 --> 00:00:28.487
I don't care if you ArseTime
the Pope on it. Give it to me.

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:30.531
Service phones have tracking enabled.

00:00:30.614 --> 00:00:32.491
We need to disappear.

00:00:33.408 --> 00:00:35.494
Now, you three, go fetch Ho and Loy.

00:00:35.577 --> 00:00:38.038
And you better move it unless you want
the Dogs to bite your cocks off.

00:00:38.121 --> 00:00:39.915
Yeah, hold--
We don't know where they live.

00:00:40.499 --> 00:00:42.626
423 Middlesex Court, Hackney.

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:44.670
16 Mervan Road, Brixton.

00:00:44.753 --> 00:00:47.381
You can figure out
the fucking postcodes yourselves.

00:00:47.464 --> 00:00:48.966
- Then where?
- You know where.

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:50.926
Where?

00:00:51.009 --> 00:00:52.177
Blake's grave.

00:00:53.554 --> 00:00:54.555
Wait, where?

00:00:57.766 --> 00:00:59.935
I've definitely seen him before.
I recognized him.

00:01:00.018 --> 00:01:02.020
- Who?
- The head.

00:01:03.564 --> 00:01:05.065
He's one of us.

00:01:05.566 --> 00:01:06.733
Was one of us.

00:02:17.554 --> 00:02:21.558
What did you do?
What the fuck just happened?

00:02:22.142 --> 00:02:23.352
He was a traitor.

00:02:24.102 --> 00:02:25.187
A spook.

00:02:26.813 --> 00:02:28.190
I spoke to Simmonds.

00:02:30.484 --> 00:02:31.610
When?

00:02:31.693 --> 00:02:34.112
I had a prepaid. Can't be traced.

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:37.783
Look, if I hadn't dealt with that scum,

00:02:37.866 --> 00:02:40.035
we'd still be sitting there
waiting for the cops to show up.

00:02:40.118 --> 00:02:41.119
Or the SAS.

00:02:41.203 --> 00:02:43.080
And those bastards shoot to kill.

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:45.415
What I did was self-defense.

00:02:45.499 --> 00:02:47.876
Self-defense? He was unarmed.

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:50.295
- He'd have done the same to us.
- The same to us how?

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:52.130
He'd have slung us in jail, that's how!

00:02:52.214 --> 00:02:53.882
How long do you think we'd last in there?

00:02:53.966 --> 00:02:56.426
Bleeding out in the corner
from some terrorist shank.

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:59.096
- I ain't going out like that.
- No, mate. That doesn't make any sense

00:02:59.179 --> 00:03:01.932
because he organized it, didn't he?

00:03:02.432 --> 00:03:03.517
Remember?

00:03:04.351 --> 00:03:06.562
He came to us, yeah?

00:03:06.645 --> 00:03:08.647
And then we all took the plan to Simmonds.

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.065
He set us up!

00:03:11.066 --> 00:03:13.443
- Nah.
- He was always too keen, too hard-line.

00:03:13.527 --> 00:03:14.862
He'd never have gone through with it.

00:03:15.696 --> 00:03:17.614
We weren't supposed to see it through.

00:03:17.698 --> 00:03:19.157
No one was supposed to die.

00:03:19.241 --> 00:03:20.701
- That was the point.
- What are we gonna do?

00:03:20.784 --> 00:03:23.662
He's playing cards,
and you cut his fucking head off!

00:03:23.745 --> 00:03:26.081
- What the fuck are we gonna fucking do?
- Take it easy!

00:03:26.874 --> 00:03:28.166
Take it easy. I say, I say--

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:30.294
Listen. We let the kid go.

00:03:30.377 --> 00:03:32.129
- He can identify us.
- No, no, no.

00:03:32.212 --> 00:03:33.547
He's been hooded up.

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:35.716
He's caught a glimpse at best.

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:37.676
He's heard our voices.
He's listening to you right now.

00:03:38.594 --> 00:03:40.554
So what? So what?

00:03:40.637 --> 00:03:42.055
He doesn't know our names, yeah?

00:03:42.139 --> 00:03:44.141
Danny Campbell, 14 Dunlop Terrace.

00:03:44.224 --> 00:03:45.475
Hey! Hey!

00:03:45.559 --> 00:03:48.061
What are you fucking playing at, hey?

00:03:48.896 --> 00:03:51.273
Hey, kid, did you hear that?
Did you hear that?

00:03:51.356 --> 00:03:53.400
He's getting a good look
at your face right now.

00:03:53.483 --> 00:03:55.569
Fuck you. Fuck you.

00:03:56.737 --> 00:03:58.822
Kid, did you hear that?

00:03:58.906 --> 00:04:00.657
If he didn't, I can say it again louder.

00:04:00.741 --> 00:04:02.784
You are a fucking snake, do you know that?

00:04:02.868 --> 00:04:04.328
- I suggest you shut your mouth…
- You fucking--

00:04:04.411 --> 00:04:05.495
…or I'll say your name and all.

00:04:07.372 --> 00:04:08.373
Yeah.

00:04:10.125 --> 00:04:11.126
Yeah.

00:04:17.007 --> 00:04:19.801
<i>There's been no indication
from the security services</i>

00:04:19.885 --> 00:04:21.512
<i>to suggest they are any closer</i>

00:04:21.595 --> 00:04:25.265
<i>to discovering the whereabouts
of the kidnapped student, Hassan Ahmed.</i>

00:04:25.349 --> 00:04:28.060
<i>And while many are hoping
for his safe return,</i>

00:04:28.143 --> 00:04:30.062
<i>there are still millions across the world</i>

00:04:30.145 --> 00:04:32.731
<i>who are continuing to share
the hostage video.</i>

00:04:32.814 --> 00:04:35.275
<i>To explore the situation
in a broader context, I'm…</i>

00:04:35.359 --> 00:04:36.235
Yes?

00:04:36.318 --> 00:04:38.403
We confirmed the victim. It's Alan Black.

00:04:40.739 --> 00:04:41.698
Hassan?

00:04:42.491 --> 00:04:43.742
No trace.

00:04:44.368 --> 00:04:46.620
Black died about 20 minutes ago.

00:04:47.955 --> 00:04:48.956
Lamb?

00:04:49.498 --> 00:04:51.708
<i>Gone. His car's here.
We're bringing it in.</i>

00:04:51.792 --> 00:04:54.336
The back door's been forced,
so it looks like he wasn't alone.

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:56.713
Neighbor opposite said
she saw a group in a huddle.

00:04:56.797 --> 00:04:58.215
Slow Horses.

00:04:59.842 --> 00:05:01.093
Whatever it is can wait.

00:05:01.176 --> 00:05:03.387
First Desk is on the secure line, ma'am.

00:05:04.137 --> 00:05:05.138
I was told it was urgent.

00:05:07.391 --> 00:05:08.392
I have to go.

00:05:08.934 --> 00:05:11.019
Secure the scene. Deep clean.

00:05:11.645 --> 00:05:13.021
Get here as fast as you can.

00:05:24.867 --> 00:05:25.951
Ingrid.

00:05:26.034 --> 00:05:28.871
<i>Let me reassure you, there is no need
to distract from your trip.</i>

00:05:28.954 --> 00:05:32.291
I'm already at the airport, having walked
out of a State Department meeting.

00:05:32.374 --> 00:05:35.002
Have you completely lost control
over there? What's going on?

00:05:35.085 --> 00:05:37.087
- Lamb's gone AWOL.
- <i>Christ.</i>

00:05:37.171 --> 00:05:39.756
<i>I've been worried about him,
which is why I put Sid Baker in there.</i>

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:41.633
What's Baker saying about Alan Black?

00:05:43.677 --> 00:05:44.720
She's in hospital.

00:05:46.013 --> 00:05:48.682
<i>She took a bullet
in a detail with Cartwright Jr.</i>

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:50.601
Right.

00:05:51.476 --> 00:05:54.730
I want Lamb and his rejects
off the street and into the Park.

00:05:54.813 --> 00:05:57.566
I need to know exactly our level
of exposure here.

00:05:57.649 --> 00:05:58.650
Where's the boy?

00:05:58.734 --> 00:06:00.110
I've pulled everyone in.

00:06:00.694 --> 00:06:03.363
SO15 are standing by,
and command center is aware.

00:06:03.447 --> 00:06:06.158
<i>Clean this up by the time I land.</i>

00:06:06.241 --> 00:06:09.703
And if it is the Slow Horses behind it,
bury them.

00:06:19.296 --> 00:06:20.297
Fuck.

00:06:40.359 --> 00:06:41.485
Twenty for the hat.

00:06:42.986 --> 00:06:43.987
Cheers.

00:07:04.383 --> 00:07:06.134
Min, is there no way to turn that off?

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:08.512
No. The CD's jammed in

00:07:08.595 --> 00:07:10.514
and the stereo doesn't turn off.

00:07:10.597 --> 00:07:11.932
Can you at least change the song?

00:07:12.015 --> 00:07:13.934
It's stuck.
It doesn't turn off. That's the issue.

00:07:14.017 --> 00:07:15.727
- Oh, my God.
- Fuck me, who cares?

00:07:15.811 --> 00:07:17.980
Look, what do we know about Alan Black?

00:07:19.815 --> 00:07:23.277
I know that he left Slough House
about a year ago, way before you joined.

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:25.112
- Uh-huh.
- Where do you know him from?

00:07:25.195 --> 00:07:26.446
I t--

00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:28.949
- Maybe the Park.
- He was kicked out of the Park years ago.

00:07:29.032 --> 00:07:31.702
Yeah, for sleeping with the wife
of the Venezuelan ambassador.

00:07:32.494 --> 00:07:34.204
How did Lamb know to go to that house?

00:07:34.288 --> 00:07:36.540
Taverner, must be. He met her earlier.

00:07:36.623 --> 00:07:39.293
- What is this? Lamb and Taverner?
- Fucking hell.

00:07:39.376 --> 00:07:40.377
Lamb's cut us loose.

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:42.462
That envelope he took off Moody,
that was his flight fund.

00:07:42.546 --> 00:07:44.214
If he wanted to, he could just disappear.

00:07:44.882 --> 00:07:47.885
Fucking hell, we are fucked.
Fuck, we really are fucked.

00:07:47.968 --> 00:07:49.636
Yeah, yeah, but I don't think he will.

00:07:50.971 --> 00:07:53.432
He broke me out when I was being guarded
by that Dog. He didn't have to.

00:07:53.515 --> 00:07:55.184
No, no, that's different.

00:07:55.267 --> 00:07:57.227
No, look. Lamb will have a play.

00:07:57.936 --> 00:07:59.021
He doesn't like to lose.

00:07:59.104 --> 00:08:00.355
Okay, so what do we do?

00:08:01.064 --> 00:08:02.191
Do we do what Lamb said?

00:08:02.274 --> 00:08:06.195
Or do we head to Regent's Park
and turn ourselves in?

00:08:06.278 --> 00:08:08.322
- Stick to Lamb's plan.
- Turn ourselves in.

00:08:09.489 --> 00:08:10.490
Right. Fine.

00:08:10.574 --> 00:08:12.659
I say that we round up everybody,

00:08:12.743 --> 00:08:15.621
head to Blake's grave,
and if Lamb doesn't show,

00:08:15.704 --> 00:08:17.581
then we know he's fucked us.

00:08:17.664 --> 00:08:19.208
- Yeah.
- Yes, stick to the plan.

00:08:20.792 --> 00:08:22.961
Oh, shit, did either of you get
Ho or Loy's addresses?

00:08:23.045 --> 00:08:25.255
Uh-huh. Yes. It was--

00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:30.135
- It was a crescent.
- 423 Middlesex Court, Hackney, E9.

00:08:30.219 --> 00:08:32.596
16 Mervan Road, Brixton, SW2.

00:08:34.181 --> 00:08:35.515
God, and postcodes.

00:08:36.265 --> 00:08:38.352
- Bagsy, not get Ho.
- Yeah, nor me.

00:08:39.352 --> 00:08:41.270
Fucking-- Thank you.

00:08:42.563 --> 00:08:45.108
Right, you two get Struan. I'll get Ho.

00:09:50.424 --> 00:09:51.466
Ma'am.

00:09:51.550 --> 00:09:52.843
Where's the boy?

00:09:52.926 --> 00:09:54.761
We're tracking multiple vehicles.

00:09:55.304 --> 00:09:56.471
What does "multiple" mean?

00:09:56.555 --> 00:09:58.432
Thirty-five vehicles passed
the traffic cams

00:09:58.515 --> 00:10:00.934
at the end of Roupell Street
15 minutes before Lamb went in.

00:10:02.895 --> 00:10:05.272
Ma'am, I know it's not my place
to ask, but what is going on?

00:10:05.355 --> 00:10:07.191
You're right. It's not your place.

00:10:14.198 --> 00:10:15.657
Why do you think Lamb bolted?

00:10:17.326 --> 00:10:19.494
Maybe he saw Black's head
and worried about what it looked like.

00:10:19.578 --> 00:10:20.996
It looked like what it was.

00:10:21.079 --> 00:10:24.625
The head of the Slow Horse is panicking
because a Slow Horse op went south.

00:10:24.708 --> 00:10:28.045
Lamb's gone rogue,
and one of my agents is dead.

00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:29.713
Jesus Christ.

00:10:30.589 --> 00:10:31.590
Who knows about this?

00:10:31.673 --> 00:10:34.635
You, me, First Desk,
and it stays that way.

00:10:35.302 --> 00:10:36.512
I'll keep the Hub on Hassan.

00:10:36.595 --> 00:10:38.430
And I want you and your Dogs
on the Slow Horses.

00:10:38.514 --> 00:10:40.307
I'll bring Lamb in myself.

00:10:40.390 --> 00:10:42.434
This is an alias he's likely to use.

00:10:43.018 --> 00:10:44.853
If he surfaces, take backup.

00:10:46.188 --> 00:10:47.940
And, Duffy?

00:10:48.023 --> 00:10:50.609
If anyone gets hurt,
I'd rather it were Lamb.

00:10:50.692 --> 00:10:53.695
I can be sure of your silence.
I won't lose any sleep over his.

00:11:03.705 --> 00:11:05.916
- Where the fuck are we going?
- Out of London.

00:11:07.125 --> 00:11:09.795
- By the backstreets. No cameras.
- Then what?

00:11:09.878 --> 00:11:11.505
Why did you tell him my name?

00:11:13.257 --> 00:11:14.341
To focus you.

00:11:15.676 --> 00:11:17.427
There's only one way out of this.

00:11:20.514 --> 00:11:22.641
- What, the boat?
- What?

00:11:24.101 --> 00:11:26.103
My cousin's boat in Harwich.

00:11:26.186 --> 00:11:28.856
- That was the backup plan.
- You and that fucking boat.

00:11:28.939 --> 00:11:31.483
No, no, no, listen.
If it gets us to Holland or France,

00:11:31.567 --> 00:11:33.652
- whichever is close--
- I'm not getting on a boat, mate.

00:11:33.735 --> 00:11:34.903
I've got a little girl.

00:11:35.404 --> 00:11:37.614
Hey, you never see your daughter.

00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:39.950
Do you?

00:11:41.785 --> 00:11:43.328
Is that what Simmonds said?

00:11:43.412 --> 00:11:45.914
"Get to the boat," yeah?
"Get to the boat."

00:11:45.998 --> 00:11:47.207
- Simmonds?
- Yeah?

00:11:47.916 --> 00:11:50.085
Nah, he wanted us to walk out,
take no action.

00:11:52.504 --> 00:11:54.006
- What?
- Fuck off.

00:11:55.215 --> 00:11:56.800
- Christ.
- No.

00:11:58.468 --> 00:12:00.179
We're on our own, aren't we?

00:12:02.097 --> 00:12:03.640
- Aren't we?
- We don't need him.

00:12:04.266 --> 00:12:06.310
Simmonds could've got us money.

00:12:06.393 --> 00:12:08.061
He could've got us new IDs.

00:12:08.145 --> 00:12:10.022
- Got us out of this!
- We don't need Simmonds!

00:12:10.105 --> 00:12:11.857
What you did back there, that was you.

00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:14.067
- It was you!
- Do you think the cops will care?

00:12:14.151 --> 00:12:15.360
You still kidnapped someone.

00:12:15.444 --> 00:12:16.987
- You still threatened to kill him.
- Yeah.

00:12:17.070 --> 00:12:19.489
- Just listen to me, right?
- We didn't mean that, did we?

00:12:19.573 --> 00:12:21.491
- You didn't mean it?
- No, we didn't mean it!

00:12:21.575 --> 00:12:23.577
- No, we were gonna let him go, weren't we?
- Yeah.

00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:25.454
How long would that have got us inside?

00:12:25.537 --> 00:12:27.289
Like, two years.

00:12:28.373 --> 00:12:30.417
I could do that, mate.
I've done it before--

00:12:30.501 --> 00:12:33.212
Listen, listen, I say we stop the van now.

00:12:33.295 --> 00:12:35.130
We let the kid go, yeah?

00:12:35.839 --> 00:12:37.174
And we get out of the country.

00:12:37.257 --> 00:12:39.051
You just told him the escape route.

00:12:39.843 --> 00:12:41.136
No, no, no.

00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:43.472
We tie him up in the woods
somewhere on the way.

00:12:44.932 --> 00:12:47.017
We'll be gone by the time they find him.

00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:48.185
We'll be gone.

00:12:50.312 --> 00:12:51.396
Yeah?

00:12:52.940 --> 00:12:54.066
Yes?

00:12:54.149 --> 00:12:55.400
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

00:12:57.027 --> 00:12:58.487
Yeah, yeah, all right. The boat.

00:12:59.029 --> 00:13:00.030
Yeah.

00:13:20.676 --> 00:13:21.677
Wait.

00:13:25.764 --> 00:13:26.849
Give Daddy a big hug.

00:13:29.268 --> 00:13:32.437
All right, monkeys, let Daddy go.
He's got important business.

00:13:32.521 --> 00:13:35.482
- At the Park?
- At the Park, yes. It's hush-hush.

00:13:36.859 --> 00:13:38.277
Isn't that right, Agent Pierce?

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:41.321
Quite so.

00:13:41.405 --> 00:13:43.073
Shall we, Agent Loy?

00:14:02.885 --> 00:14:05.762
Hey, we should keep kissing 'cause
they might see us in the rearview mirror.

00:14:07.806 --> 00:14:08.849
Well, let me drive.

00:14:14.938 --> 00:14:16.690
Where are you? Where are you?

00:15:34.726 --> 00:15:36.937
- What's happenin', bruv?
- I'm looking for Ho.

00:15:37.521 --> 00:15:38.814
No Ho here, man.

00:15:41.024 --> 00:15:42.276
Why the fuck are you here?

00:15:42.359 --> 00:15:45.404
There's been a complaint about your music.
It's shit.

00:15:45.487 --> 00:15:46.488
Come on. We gotta go.

00:15:47.573 --> 00:15:48.782
Come on!

00:15:58.667 --> 00:15:59.793
Are you in charge?

00:15:59.877 --> 00:16:02.129
Show us your CCTV footage
from 20 minutes ago.

00:16:08.969 --> 00:16:11.847
So, do you want to talk about
what just happened?

00:16:11.930 --> 00:16:14.224
Well, we were too late is what happened.

00:16:14.308 --> 00:16:15.809
No. I meant us.

00:16:16.852 --> 00:16:20.272
I think we should talk about
how we evade MI5 security, Min.

00:16:21.190 --> 00:16:23.150
Well, it turns out
we evade them by kissing.

00:16:23.233 --> 00:16:25.736
There's not gonna be any "us"
if we don't stay ahead of the Dogs

00:16:25.819 --> 00:16:27.779
and work out
what the fuck Black was up to.

00:16:27.863 --> 00:16:31.074
Yes, of course.
But once-- once that's sorted…

00:16:32.117 --> 00:16:33.869
"us" could still be a thing?

00:16:33.952 --> 00:16:36.038
Less likely every time you bring it up.

00:16:42.419 --> 00:16:43.462
Hey, come on.

00:16:45.797 --> 00:16:47.382
They might let us share a cell.

00:16:52.095 --> 00:16:53.972
God. We really, really are fucked.

00:16:56.058 --> 00:16:57.226
There.

00:16:58.602 --> 00:16:59.770
Yeah, that's him.

00:17:03.565 --> 00:17:04.775
Out.

00:17:05.442 --> 00:17:07.861
Now. Three. Two.

00:17:14.367 --> 00:17:15.618
Yeah, here we go.

00:17:21.916 --> 00:17:24.002
- Duffy.
- <i>He's using that ID you gave me.</i>

00:17:24.086 --> 00:17:25.878
Booked a 06:00 a.m. flight to Istanbul.

00:17:26.463 --> 00:17:28.757
- Are you sure?
- I'm looking at the CCTV right now.

00:17:28.841 --> 00:17:31.093
His face is obscured, but it's Lamb.

00:17:32.469 --> 00:17:34.388
- We're off to Gatwick.
- Duffy!

00:17:35.180 --> 00:17:36.181
Hold on.

00:17:38.183 --> 00:17:40.310
Look at this.

00:17:42.521 --> 00:17:44.147
You dirty bastard.

00:17:44.231 --> 00:17:45.232
What?

00:17:45.315 --> 00:17:49.069
He's also booked flights from Heathrow,
Stansted, London City, Birmingham,

00:17:49.695 --> 00:17:51.989
and Manchester.
He knows we'll have to cover 'em all.

00:17:52.072 --> 00:17:54.783
- <i>He's drawing us off.</i>
- Yeah, while he runs for a ferry.

00:17:54.867 --> 00:17:57.035
No. I know where he's going.

00:18:00.664 --> 00:18:01.790
Oh, God.

00:18:23.645 --> 00:18:26.440
Whoever you are, back off. I'm armed.

00:18:27.441 --> 00:18:29.526
- No, you're not.
- Lamb?

00:18:30.527 --> 00:18:32.237
Come on. Open up.

00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:37.201
Now.

00:18:41.455 --> 00:18:43.790
It-- It's the middle of the night.

00:18:43.874 --> 00:18:45.959
You can't just show up unannounced.

00:18:46.043 --> 00:18:47.836
No. Leave the light off.

00:18:50.255 --> 00:18:51.465
What do you want?

00:18:52.424 --> 00:18:53.884
Fallen off the wagon, have we?

00:18:54.384 --> 00:18:56.053
It's actually a water bottle.

00:18:56.553 --> 00:18:58.138
You've probably never seen one.

00:18:59.097 --> 00:19:00.098
Get dressed.

00:19:01.058 --> 00:19:03.685
- I live here. You can't tell me--
- Just get dressed!

00:19:12.110 --> 00:19:13.278
Where are we going?

00:19:16.073 --> 00:19:17.074
Where are we going?

00:19:17.157 --> 00:19:19.201
- What are you doing?
- I'll tell you on the way.

00:19:19.284 --> 00:19:21.036
We just gotta move fast.
The Dogs are on us.

00:19:21.662 --> 00:19:24.498
Why are they after me?
I've not done anything.

00:19:25.415 --> 00:19:27.626
Well, nothing they'd be able to trace.

00:19:29.378 --> 00:19:31.004
We gotta keep switching vehicles.

00:19:36.718 --> 00:19:40.556
You can't hot-wire any of these.
You need to hack the alarm system.

00:19:41.682 --> 00:19:43.308
I can help with that for the right price.

00:19:44.726 --> 00:19:46.061
Come on.

00:19:46.144 --> 00:19:47.145
I'll go analog.

00:19:52.734 --> 00:19:55.737
I'll have a bacon double cheeseburger…

00:19:55.821 --> 00:19:59.074
- Yeah?
- …chips, a can of Fanta

00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:01.535
and…

00:20:02.744 --> 00:20:05.038
- You just got Kit Kats and TWIX, yeah?
- Just that, thanks.

00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:09.501
Listen.

00:20:11.545 --> 00:20:13.172
If you're in any kind of personal trouble,

00:20:14.131 --> 00:20:17.092
I just want you to know
I couldn't give a fuck.

00:20:17.176 --> 00:20:18.969
And I don't want to be dragged into it.

00:20:19.052 --> 00:20:20.262
Yeah, you're already in it.

00:20:20.345 --> 00:20:21.555
Wha--

00:20:26.185 --> 00:20:27.019
Fuck!

00:20:31.356 --> 00:20:32.357
Fuck!

00:20:35.027 --> 00:20:36.153
Yeah?

00:20:36.236 --> 00:20:38.238
<i>We have Loy downstairs for you, ma'am.</i>

00:20:38.822 --> 00:20:40.073
I'll be right down.

00:21:05.390 --> 00:21:06.642
Ma'am.

00:21:24.159 --> 00:21:25.202
Hello.

00:21:27.371 --> 00:21:29.039
Would you excuse me a minute? I just--

00:21:29.957 --> 00:21:33.043
It is relentless up there.

00:21:34.002 --> 00:21:36.630
- I can imagine.
- Oh, no, you can't.

00:21:37.256 --> 00:21:38.549
None of you can.

00:21:41.218 --> 00:21:43.554
How does it feel to be back here
at the Park?

00:21:44.513 --> 00:21:47.266
Well, this isn't really the Park I knew.

00:21:47.349 --> 00:21:51.144
I mean, I've never been down here.
I didn't know we had rooms like this.

00:21:51.228 --> 00:21:52.604
Not many people do.

00:21:53.105 --> 00:21:54.898
That's why I chose it for you.

00:21:56.233 --> 00:21:57.943
I don't want anyone to know you're here.

00:22:01.738 --> 00:22:05.242
My wife knows I'm here… at the Park.

00:22:05.742 --> 00:22:08.036
She still thinks you work here,
doesn't she?

00:22:09.705 --> 00:22:11.331
I've been trying to find the right moment.

00:22:11.415 --> 00:22:12.666
It's been a year.

00:22:14.334 --> 00:22:16.295
Your little boy must be, what, six?

00:22:17.421 --> 00:22:19.173
And Evie, seven?

00:22:19.256 --> 00:22:20.674
No, eight.

00:22:21.550 --> 00:22:24.344
They must love the idea
their daddy's James Bond.

00:22:24.970 --> 00:22:27.764
I understand why you don't want anyone
to know the truth.

00:22:27.848 --> 00:22:29.975
Is that what this is about?
Me lying to my family?

00:22:30.058 --> 00:22:32.311
You lied to the investigators first,
didn't you?

00:22:33.729 --> 00:22:35.022
I panicked.

00:22:35.105 --> 00:22:39.067
Said you didn't send the email,
even though it came under your login.

00:22:41.069 --> 00:22:42.070
Do you want to read it?

00:22:43.572 --> 00:22:45.407
- Not really.
- I think you should.

00:22:51.455 --> 00:22:54.124
"Anyone else surprised
by Tearney's outfit?

00:22:54.875 --> 00:22:56.710
ISIS chic.

00:22:56.793 --> 00:22:58.212
Maybe she's undercover?"

00:22:58.754 --> 00:23:02.007
She wore a shawl at a press conference.

00:23:02.090 --> 00:23:04.510
It-- It-- It looked a bit like-- like…

00:23:07.679 --> 00:23:09.598
You used a service email chain

00:23:09.681 --> 00:23:14.353
to imply that the head of MI5 was working
undercover for a terrorist organization.

00:23:14.436 --> 00:23:15.979
But it was meant as a joke.

00:23:17.272 --> 00:23:20.275
But it's a pattern of behavior, Struan.

00:23:20.359 --> 00:23:22.027
Joking around.

00:23:22.945 --> 00:23:25.531
Undermining your superiors.

00:23:25.614 --> 00:23:28.867
Questioning the line of command.
Not taking your job seriously.

00:23:28.951 --> 00:23:31.828
And what we do here is very serious.

00:23:34.248 --> 00:23:36.166
So if you were to come back here
to work at the Park,

00:23:36.250 --> 00:23:38.585
I need to know
that you have learnt your lesson.

00:23:39.127 --> 00:23:40.128
Absolutely!

00:23:40.796 --> 00:23:42.047
I can't promise anything.

00:23:44.716 --> 00:23:46.927
You probably know
how many people have made it back

00:23:47.010 --> 00:23:49.513
from Slough House
to upstairs here at Regent's Park.

00:23:50.889 --> 00:23:52.099
None.

00:23:53.392 --> 00:23:54.726
It's not impossible.

00:23:59.147 --> 00:24:01.441
Have you seen anything unusual
at Slough House,

00:24:01.525 --> 00:24:03.068
any activity?

00:24:09.491 --> 00:24:10.492
No.

00:24:17.708 --> 00:24:18.917
I don't think so.

00:24:23.380 --> 00:24:25.257
What sort of unusual activity?

00:24:27.467 --> 00:24:29.344
It's a shame you haven't noticed anything.

00:24:29.428 --> 00:24:30.888
I was relying on you.

00:24:32.973 --> 00:24:34.474
You see, I have a problem.

00:24:35.434 --> 00:24:36.894
Quite a big problem.

00:24:37.686 --> 00:24:40.189
How would you like to be
part of the solution?

00:24:43.901 --> 00:24:46.278
Slow down! This isn't <i>Mario Kart</i>!

00:24:46.361 --> 00:24:48.322
Can you get Alan Black's
service record up on that?

00:24:48.405 --> 00:24:50.782
Can you stop wasting my time
with rhetorical questions?

00:24:52.951 --> 00:24:55.162
Can you just do it please?
Or whatever the magic word is.

00:24:55.245 --> 00:24:57.581
How did you find me?
Those are the magic words.

00:24:57.664 --> 00:24:59.458
Stop dicking around, Roddy. Just do it.

00:25:00.667 --> 00:25:02.586
No, but this is a major security breach.

00:25:02.669 --> 00:25:04.796
I need to review protocols
so it doesn't happen again.

00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:07.633
You overlooked a massive weak spot
in your defenses.

00:25:07.716 --> 00:25:08.967
Impossible.

00:25:09.051 --> 00:25:11.136
I hacked the personnel database
at the Park.

00:25:11.220 --> 00:25:12.930
I changed my address.

00:25:13.013 --> 00:25:16.016
My phone, my Internet, my bills,
even my bank account

00:25:16.099 --> 00:25:19.019
are all linked to false IDs
that rotate every 24 hours.

00:25:19.102 --> 00:25:21.438
I'm so far off the grid,
I don't even know where the grid is.

00:25:21.522 --> 00:25:22.523
Lamb followed you home.

00:25:24.525 --> 00:25:25.609
When the fuck?

00:25:25.692 --> 00:25:27.402
I don't know, but he told everyone.

00:25:29.613 --> 00:25:30.531
Black! Come on.

00:25:33.033 --> 00:25:34.743
You worked with Black, didn't you?

00:25:35.786 --> 00:25:37.287
- Roddy!
- Yeah!

00:25:37.371 --> 00:25:39.915
What was Black doing in that house
with Hassan Ahmed?

00:25:39.998 --> 00:25:42.251
Any clues in anything he said or did?

00:25:42.334 --> 00:25:44.002
Yeah, on the last day he said, "Fuck you.

00:25:44.086 --> 00:25:46.588
I'm off to kidnap an Asian kid
and behead him for the Union Jack."

00:25:46.672 --> 00:25:48.757
Fuck's sake, Roddy. Right, fine. Okay?

00:25:49.675 --> 00:25:51.385
You drive like a maniac, you know.

00:25:55.597 --> 00:25:57.766
- That's him.
- Eyes on the road!

00:25:57.850 --> 00:25:58.851
Look ahead!

00:25:58.934 --> 00:26:01.144
I've definitely seen him somewhere.
Come on.

00:26:02.104 --> 00:26:05.232
We never crossed paths at Slough House.
I think he left before I joined the Park.

00:26:05.315 --> 00:26:07.192
This has literally nothing to do with me.

00:26:08.068 --> 00:26:09.152
Do you recognize him?

00:26:10.404 --> 00:26:14.449
Alan Black.
Left Slough House soon after I arrived.

00:26:15.075 --> 00:26:16.285
Seen him since?

00:26:22.082 --> 00:26:23.083
You sure?

00:26:24.376 --> 00:26:27.421
You haven't seen him recently
in the company of Jackson Lamb?

00:26:30.424 --> 00:26:32.551
Well, not since he left.

00:26:40.934 --> 00:26:43.187
Then you're not part
of the solution then, are you?

00:26:43.270 --> 00:26:44.980
You're just another problem.

00:26:59.620 --> 00:27:02.164
What are you doing?
This isn't Blake's grave.

00:27:02.247 --> 00:27:03.665
I just need to know that she's okay.

00:27:03.749 --> 00:27:04.958
- All right?
- Why?

00:27:05.876 --> 00:27:07.336
She can't help you now!

00:27:08.045 --> 00:27:10.547
You'll be lucky if you get ten minutes
before the Park get here!

00:27:10.631 --> 00:27:12.966
I'll be out in five.
Just leave the engine running!

00:27:13.050 --> 00:27:14.051
Fuck.

00:27:31.485 --> 00:27:33.779
<i>You have two new messages.</i>

00:27:33.862 --> 00:27:34.947
<i>Message one.</i>

00:27:35.656 --> 00:27:39.076
<i>This is Diana Taverner.
You need to come to the Park straightaway.</i>

00:27:39.159 --> 00:27:40.994
<i>Jackson Lamb's gone rogue.</i>

00:27:41.745 --> 00:27:42.955
<i>Message two.</i>

00:27:43.789 --> 00:27:47.459
<i>Catherine, Diana Taverner again.
I really need you to come to the Park.</i>

00:27:47.543 --> 00:27:49.294
<i>There are things
about Charles Partner's death</i>

00:27:49.378 --> 00:27:50.879
<i>that Lamb hasn't told you.</i>

00:27:50.963 --> 00:27:52.172
<i>Call me.</i>

00:28:01.014 --> 00:28:01.849
Morning.

00:28:05.769 --> 00:28:08.397
<i>I picked up your blue suit.</i>

00:28:10.899 --> 00:28:12.901
You could wear that today if you fancy.

00:28:15.696 --> 00:28:17.614
- Charles?
- What's taking so long?

00:28:18.824 --> 00:28:20.158
Get out of my bedroom.

00:28:20.242 --> 00:28:22.870
What, you think I want to catch you
in your underwear?

00:28:23.620 --> 00:28:25.163
I imagine you'd like that.

00:28:25.247 --> 00:28:29.042
Almost as much as I'd like to see you
in your nylon Y-fronts.

00:28:29.626 --> 00:28:30.919
Come on.

00:28:31.003 --> 00:28:32.045
Now!

00:28:41.555 --> 00:28:43.599
What was Taverner talking about?

00:28:43.682 --> 00:28:45.475
What don't I know about Charles's death?

00:28:45.559 --> 00:28:47.978
She's screwing with your head.

00:28:48.061 --> 00:28:51.315
Look, you could leave with me now
or with less friendly people later.

00:28:51.398 --> 00:28:52.399
It's up to you.

00:29:00.032 --> 00:29:01.909
No, leave the phone.

00:29:15.005 --> 00:29:18.258
Hi. Sorry, can you tell me
which room Sidonie Baker's in?

00:29:18.884 --> 00:29:20.302
It's immediate family only.

00:29:20.385 --> 00:29:21.845
Yeah, I'm her stepbrother.

00:29:21.929 --> 00:29:23.597
Can you sign in on the screen?

00:29:24.973 --> 00:29:25.974
Yeah, yeah.

00:29:36.860 --> 00:29:39.821
- Great. Which room?
- ICU room 4.

00:29:39.905 --> 00:29:41.949
- End of the corridor on the right.
- Great, thank you.

00:29:52.209 --> 00:29:53.335
Pierce?

00:29:56.672 --> 00:29:57.923
Baker has a visitor.

00:30:00.342 --> 00:30:02.219
What the fuck is he doing there?

00:30:02.719 --> 00:30:04.054
Who can get there fastest?

00:30:05.597 --> 00:30:08.308
<i>Cartwright's back at the hospital.
Get him.</i>

00:30:08.392 --> 00:30:09.434
With pleasure.

00:30:13.814 --> 00:30:15.107
Do fuck off.

00:30:16.859 --> 00:30:18.610
It's River, isn't it?

00:30:18.694 --> 00:30:21.488
Has he gone off the rails,
and now we're paying the price?

00:30:21.572 --> 00:30:23.198
Well, not a million miles off.

00:30:24.408 --> 00:30:26.368
Baker's been hurt. Moody's dead.

00:30:27.202 --> 00:30:29.538
There's probably a C&amp;amp;C out on all of us.

00:30:29.621 --> 00:30:30.789
Fuckers.

00:30:30.873 --> 00:30:32.624
How badly hurt is Sid?

00:30:32.708 --> 00:30:36.545
Not as badly hurt as Moody's dead.
Did you catch that bit?

00:30:36.628 --> 00:30:40.757
Jed Moody was always going to end badly,
but I like Sid.

00:31:08.368 --> 00:31:09.369
Busy night?

00:31:09.453 --> 00:31:11.663
You angling for overtime, Nick?

00:31:11.747 --> 00:31:14.750
- You're talking to the wrong bloke.
- Need to know if you're carrying a weapon.

00:31:14.833 --> 00:31:15.834
Nope.

00:31:15.918 --> 00:31:17.544
I'll have to check that.
Spread 'em, please.

00:31:17.628 --> 00:31:21.507
Please, Nick, shut the kid up.
Come on, it's embarrassing. You're a pro.

00:31:21.590 --> 00:31:24.092
You can tell from the fold of my clothes
I'm not carrying.

00:31:24.176 --> 00:31:27.262
- I'm afraid you don't get a choice--
- If he takes another step towards me,

00:31:27.346 --> 00:31:29.848
he'll be frisking me with broken wrists.

00:31:37.648 --> 00:31:38.649
Come on.

00:31:49.618 --> 00:31:51.787
Webb, you can drive.

00:31:52.371 --> 00:31:54.081
Ms. Standish, you're up front.

00:31:54.790 --> 00:31:57.000
Lamb, you're in the back with me.

00:32:08.220 --> 00:32:09.221
Come on.

00:32:09.847 --> 00:32:11.682
Are you serious?

00:32:22.192 --> 00:32:25.654
Time's up, Cartwright. Screw all this.

00:33:07.487 --> 00:33:09.323
<i>Come on. Unbelievable.</i>

00:33:09.907 --> 00:33:11.450
You love it when I'm hard on you.

00:33:14.328 --> 00:33:16.705
<i>What about that story
about you tailing Taverner?</i>

00:33:16.788 --> 00:33:17.789
<i>Is that just a myth?</i>

00:33:20.918 --> 00:33:23.337
No. Not a myth, actually.
That really did happen.

00:33:25.297 --> 00:33:27.341
Shit.

00:33:31.512 --> 00:33:32.513
Thanks, Sid.

00:33:45.817 --> 00:33:47.152
Yeah, f--

00:34:21.478 --> 00:34:22.938
Wait, wait, wait!

00:34:25.274 --> 00:34:28.569
- <i>Door closing.</i>
- Come on, come on, come on.

00:34:34.824 --> 00:34:37.494
- For fuck--
- Hi.

00:34:39.621 --> 00:34:41.248
Routine or emergency?

00:34:41.331 --> 00:34:42.748
She's just switching wards.

00:34:42.833 --> 00:34:43.792
Thank you.

00:35:03.312 --> 00:35:04.646
Oi.

00:35:12.321 --> 00:35:13.363
Hey!

00:35:23.373 --> 00:35:24.458
Shit.

00:35:37.429 --> 00:35:41.225
Right. About 20 miles outside of Harwich,

00:35:41.308 --> 00:35:43.227
we pass through some countryside.

00:35:43.727 --> 00:35:45.270
Looks like there's some woods.

00:35:46.522 --> 00:35:47.564
We leave him there, yeah?

00:35:48.607 --> 00:35:50.192
That sounds good to me.

00:35:51.276 --> 00:35:52.277
Yeah?

00:35:52.819 --> 00:35:53.904
If you like.

00:35:58.242 --> 00:35:59.493
Do you hear that, kid?

00:35:59.576 --> 00:36:02.579
We're gonna leave you someplace
and someone is gonna find you, okay?

00:36:03.121 --> 00:36:04.998
Yeah? It's okay.

00:36:05.082 --> 00:36:07.584
Really, it's just a bit fucked up
is what it is.

00:36:09.127 --> 00:36:12.589
We didn't mean it to go like this.
We just wanted to wake people up.

00:36:12.673 --> 00:36:14.842
Do you know what I mean?
It's-- It is what it is.

00:36:15.801 --> 00:36:16.802
I'm…

00:36:18.804 --> 00:36:19.972
I'm sorry.

00:36:26.728 --> 00:36:28.939
- You're sorry?
- Hey. Hey!

00:36:29.022 --> 00:36:31.066
Someone died, okay?

00:36:31.149 --> 00:36:33.193
Spook or not, that's not right.

00:36:33.277 --> 00:36:34.611
Are they sorry?

00:36:35.195 --> 00:36:37.698
When they kill our troops
and rape our women?

00:36:39.116 --> 00:36:40.117
Nah.

00:36:40.742 --> 00:36:41.869
Fuck that.

00:36:42.619 --> 00:36:43.620
"Sorry"?

00:36:44.454 --> 00:36:47.416
- What the fuck is wrong with you, mate?
- What's-- What's wro--

00:36:47.499 --> 00:36:51.003
The kid is not a murderer, okay?
And neither am I.

00:36:51.086 --> 00:36:52.379
I am though, aren't I?

00:36:53.839 --> 00:36:57.301
The way I see it, I'm already going down
for one murder, so what's a second?

00:36:59.219 --> 00:37:00.596
Fuck it.

00:37:00.679 --> 00:37:02.764
- We're killing him.
- I'm not killing anyone, mate.

00:37:02.848 --> 00:37:04.558
- We've lost our fucking--
- Take it easy!

00:37:04.641 --> 00:37:06.643
Shut your mouths! The question is then

00:37:06.727 --> 00:37:10.147
whether you've got the balls
to stop me, isn't it?

00:37:12.274 --> 00:37:13.275
Yes?

00:37:32.461 --> 00:37:35.214
- Yeah?
- Inbound with Lamb and Standish.

00:37:35.839 --> 00:37:38.967
Tell her she best interrogate me
in a room with a window.

00:37:39.635 --> 00:37:43.222
I had a lamb bhuna earlier
that's gonna make its presence felt.

00:37:51.396 --> 00:37:52.481
What's happening?

00:37:52.564 --> 00:37:54.775
Catherine Standish is being brought in.

00:37:55.400 --> 00:37:58.195
I'm sure I can make her remember
what you seem to have forgotten.

00:37:58.278 --> 00:37:59.696
What happens to me?

00:37:59.780 --> 00:38:01.657
Are you gonna tell my wife
I don't work here?

00:38:01.740 --> 00:38:03.575
Yes. And I'm gonna tell her
you're being held

00:38:03.659 --> 00:38:05.953
as part of the investigation
into Alan Black's death.

00:38:06.036 --> 00:38:08.288
No! No, wait, wait, no, no.
Please, please, please.

00:38:08.872 --> 00:38:10.207
It's coming back to me now.

00:38:10.290 --> 00:38:13.418
I blanked it out because it felt like
something I shouldn't have seen.

00:38:14.545 --> 00:38:19.091
I definitely remember seeing Lamb
and Alan Black together

00:38:19.842 --> 00:38:21.760
after Black had left Slough House.

00:38:25.514 --> 00:38:28.642
If I rack my brains,
I can probably put a date on it.

00:38:37.776 --> 00:38:39.111
Well, we've got it on tape.

00:38:39.194 --> 00:38:42.406
Let's err on the side of caution.
Get it down in writing.

00:38:45.033 --> 00:38:46.034
Sit.

00:38:52.624 --> 00:38:55.210
Is she gonna stick us
in those new basement cells?

00:38:55.752 --> 00:38:57.671
I've not seen them myself.

00:38:58.422 --> 00:39:00.424
I used to work out of the old building.

00:39:02.050 --> 00:39:05.387
But, you know,
I've been in the Stasi cells,

00:39:05.470 --> 00:39:07.472
so anything you've got will be a luxury.

00:39:09.308 --> 00:39:10.517
And then what?

00:39:10.601 --> 00:39:13.395
Lady Di's gonna rewrite the timeline,

00:39:13.478 --> 00:39:16.940
stick Slough House in the frame
for this fucking disaster.

00:39:24.781 --> 00:39:26.325
Is no one gonna say "Bless you"?

00:39:27.576 --> 00:39:28.577
No?

00:39:29.578 --> 00:39:30.704
Bit rude.

00:39:33.624 --> 00:39:35.626
Course, she'd rather
that kid had his head cut off

00:39:35.709 --> 00:39:37.211
than admit it was her fault.

00:39:38.629 --> 00:39:40.464
She's scorching the earth.

00:39:41.215 --> 00:39:42.841
She's covering her tracks.

00:39:43.884 --> 00:39:46.678
But it's the covering of the tracks
that always gets you in the end,

00:39:46.762 --> 00:39:47.971
isn't that right, Nick?

00:39:49.306 --> 00:39:51.058
I mean, she knows that, of course.

00:39:52.017 --> 00:39:54.019
She thinks she's the exception.

00:39:55.604 --> 00:39:57.439
That's what everybody thinks.

00:39:57.523 --> 00:39:58.857
Everybody's always wrong.

00:39:58.941 --> 00:40:02.277
Look, the last time I was in the Park,
Diana Taverner was in charge.

00:40:02.361 --> 00:40:05.280
Until that changes, I'll do what she says.

00:40:05.364 --> 00:40:07.282
Yeah, but it's all gonna unravel, Nick.

00:40:07.366 --> 00:40:11.203
The sensible thing to do would be
forget Lady Di's London rules

00:40:11.286 --> 00:40:15.123
and concentrate on finding that kid
before he gets whacked.

00:40:16.208 --> 00:40:17.960
If that's not already happened.

00:40:19.628 --> 00:40:23.215
Oh, Jesus! You keep a cat in here or what?

00:40:24.800 --> 00:40:26.677
Standish, you got a tissue in that bag?

00:40:31.723 --> 00:40:33.350
I've only got one left.

00:40:34.351 --> 00:40:35.561
Give us it here then.

00:40:35.644 --> 00:40:38.397
I have a question I want answered first.

00:40:38.480 --> 00:40:40.315
Oh, for-- What now?

00:40:40.399 --> 00:40:42.192
The question pertains to something

00:40:42.276 --> 00:40:44.987
that was raised in a voice mail
that I received tonight.

00:40:46.238 --> 00:40:47.614
I'll tell you later.

00:40:48.866 --> 00:40:49.867
Pinkie promise.

00:40:51.743 --> 00:40:52.828
Tissue.

00:40:58.041 --> 00:41:00.711
Now, we all know I'm not
going to shoot you dead, Mr. Webb.

00:41:00.794 --> 00:41:03.255
But I'll put a bullet through your foot
if I have to.

00:41:04.131 --> 00:41:05.090
Pull over.

00:41:07.134 --> 00:41:09.428
- I said pull over.
- Yeah, all right, all right.

00:41:12.890 --> 00:41:14.892
This is your stop, boys.

00:41:22.524 --> 00:41:25.152
You two can walk from here
if that's all right.

00:41:43.670 --> 00:41:46.590
You're full of surprises, Standish.
You know that?

00:41:49.593 --> 00:41:52.179
How'd you know my Y-fronts are nylon?

00:41:53.430 --> 00:41:55.098
Because I have to buy them for you.

00:41:56.767 --> 00:41:57.809
Drip-dry.

00:41:58.560 --> 00:41:59.561
Very efficient.
