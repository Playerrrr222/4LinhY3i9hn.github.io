WEBVTT

00:00:06.965 --> 00:00:11.428
<i>Well, the race is on to save a young,
British Asian man, Hassan Ahmed,</i>

00:00:11.512 --> 00:00:14.806
<i>who has been kidnapped
by members of a far right group</i>

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:17.684
<i>calling themselves the Sons of Albion.</i>

00:00:17.768 --> 00:00:20.354
- <i>The kidnappers have made no demands…</i>
- Jesus.

00:00:20.437 --> 00:00:22.189
<i>…and it appears
the authorities are no closer…</i>

00:00:22.272 --> 00:00:23.815
- Shit.
- <i>…to discovering his whereabouts.</i>

00:00:23.899 --> 00:00:25.442
- So bleak.
- Yeah.

00:00:25.526 --> 00:00:27.945
I mean, we're behind the scenes,
and we know nothing.

00:00:28.612 --> 00:00:30.322
Well, we know the bastards
are gonna kill him.

00:00:30.405 --> 00:00:32.533
- Yeah, because they haven't made--
- Made any demands, yeah.

00:00:32.616 --> 00:00:35.244
<i>…how and, indeed, why he was targeted</i>

00:00:35.327 --> 00:00:36.620
<i>beyond his ethnic background.</i>

00:00:36.703 --> 00:00:38.455
Do you think Lamb knows what's going on?

00:00:39.122 --> 00:00:41.875
Well, I'm sure he could find out
if he wanted to.

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:43.418
I'm not sure he cares.

00:00:43.502 --> 00:00:47.506
You know, Lamb's password is "password."

00:00:47.589 --> 00:00:48.924
"Password"?

00:00:49.007 --> 00:00:51.051
- How do you know?
- Ho told me.

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.762
- And what did that cost you?
- Nothing.

00:00:54.555 --> 00:00:57.724
He just wanted to tell someone, didn't he?
To prove how clever he is.

00:00:59.768 --> 00:01:02.479
How much do you think
the Park's gonna be telling Lamb?

00:01:02.563 --> 00:01:06.316
I mean, we could find out. He's bound
to be copied in on updates for live ops.

00:01:09.194 --> 00:01:12.406
But… probably shouldn't.

00:01:14.032 --> 00:01:15.242
Do you want another drink?

00:01:15.742 --> 00:01:18.495
Yeah, maybe. Or…

00:01:19.121 --> 00:01:21.164
I don't know. Maybe back to the office.

00:01:23.584 --> 00:01:26.670
Yeah. Okay. Well, I mean, it's better
than getting pissed here, isn't it?

00:01:26.753 --> 00:01:28.255
- Not helping, are we?
- Exactly. No.

00:01:28.338 --> 00:01:29.715
- Yeah.
- Last order at the bar, guys.

00:01:29.798 --> 00:01:31.008
Okay, thanks. Another drink?

00:01:31.091 --> 00:01:32.759
Okay, but something quick. Shots.

00:01:35.554 --> 00:01:39.391
- Oh, my God. I don't know--
- Can you hurry up?

00:01:39.474 --> 00:01:40.601
- Can I just do it?
- Here.

00:01:40.684 --> 00:01:42.352
- 'Cause it's really painful to watch.
- Go on.

00:01:42.853 --> 00:01:44.229
- All right. Are you ready?
- Yeah.

00:01:44.313 --> 00:01:46.440
- Want to see my technique in action?
- Yeah.

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:47.941
Okay.

00:01:51.445 --> 00:01:52.279
Arse.

00:01:52.362 --> 00:01:54.531
You have to turn the handle at the same--

00:01:55.866 --> 00:01:58.702
How have you still not learned
how to open the fricking door?

00:01:58.785 --> 00:02:00.245
- But that was smooth.
- Uh-huh.

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.414
- That was smooth as you like.
- According to who?

00:02:02.497 --> 00:02:05.918
What? Me. That was cool.
Cool as a cucumber. All right, shush.

00:02:06.001 --> 00:02:07.252
- Try and be quiet.
- No, you sh--

00:02:07.336 --> 00:02:08.628
Try, if you can.

00:02:08.711 --> 00:02:10.380
I can't see.

00:02:10.464 --> 00:02:11.548
Right, turn that w--

00:02:11.632 --> 00:02:13.425
Let me get the light.

00:02:28.148 --> 00:02:30.859
Sorry. Am I not doing it right?

00:02:30.943 --> 00:02:33.153
- I haven't-- It's been a while.
- Did you hear that?

00:02:34.488 --> 00:02:35.781
Hear what?

00:02:35.864 --> 00:02:36.949
I don't know. A noise.

00:02:37.032 --> 00:02:38.116
Like a mouse?

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:39.409
Do we have mice?

00:02:40.035 --> 00:02:42.746
Yeah. Yeah, we've got lots of mice.

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:44.748
Or something that does mouse droppings
around the place.

00:02:44.831 --> 00:02:46.166
- Shut up.
- Ho.

00:02:51.547 --> 00:02:53.090
Okay, I heard that.

00:02:56.385 --> 00:02:59.429
I think it was Lamb's office.
Sounded like Lamb's office.

00:02:59.513 --> 00:03:01.473
I don't know. There's no lights on.

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:34.923
Wait. Are you sure we wanna do this?

00:03:35.465 --> 00:03:37.217
What else should we be doing?

00:03:37.301 --> 00:03:40.304
Well, I mean, I'd rather be doing
what we were just doing.

00:03:40.846 --> 00:03:43.223
- God.
- All right. Of course. Priorities.

00:04:14.254 --> 00:04:15.255
No.

00:04:17.673 --> 00:04:18.675
Corkboard?

00:04:20.552 --> 00:04:21.928
No, there were two noises.

00:04:22.012 --> 00:04:23.263
Well, maybe it bounced.

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:26.725
Okay.

00:04:46.245 --> 00:04:47.329
Fuck it.

00:04:48.705 --> 00:04:49.957
So, what now?

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:53.001
Do you wanna go back to my place
or we go back to yours?

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:56.255
Let's do one more sweep.

00:05:07.641 --> 00:05:10.102
Min? Min!

00:05:12.771 --> 00:05:13.772
Min.

00:05:15.023 --> 00:05:16.358
- Min, you all right?
- Yeah. Yeah.

00:05:16.441 --> 00:05:17.943
- Min?
- The gun, the gun.

00:05:20.821 --> 00:05:22.781
- You okay?
- Fine. I'm fine.

00:05:24.658 --> 00:05:27.244
No pulse. I think you broke his neck.

00:05:27.327 --> 00:05:28.954
He broke his own fucking neck.

00:05:30.581 --> 00:05:31.790
Oh, my God.

00:05:35.752 --> 00:05:36.795
Oh, my God.

00:05:36.879 --> 00:05:38.922
- Fuck.
- What the fuck?

00:06:34.728 --> 00:06:37.898
<i>Dr. Lawrence, come to surgical three.
Non-emergency.</i>

00:06:37.981 --> 00:06:40.400
<i>Dr. Lawrence, please.
Dr. Lawrence, please.</i>

00:06:41.068 --> 00:06:43.904
<i>Dr. Lawrence, come to surgical three.
Non-emergency.</i>

00:07:11.306 --> 00:07:12.599
Can I help you, sir?

00:07:16.937 --> 00:07:18.647
Think you must be lost, sir.

00:07:19.189 --> 00:07:21.650
They'll help you at reception
with whatever you're after.

00:07:46.216 --> 00:07:47.593
A shoe…

00:07:49.344 --> 00:07:50.512
in a bag?

00:07:51.930 --> 00:07:53.265
I'm embarrassed for you.

00:07:56.727 --> 00:07:59.563
Wait, wait, wait.
He's got my phone and my pass.

00:08:05.652 --> 00:08:08.071
- Take all the time you need.
- Yeah.

00:08:13.577 --> 00:08:16.413
Sorry. Sidonie Baker, do you where she's--

00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:18.415
Lamb.

00:08:19.750 --> 00:08:21.877
Lamb, I can't just leave
without knowing how she is.

00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:23.587
She's still on the table.

00:08:24.671 --> 00:08:26.173
What do you mean? Is she gonna make it?

00:08:26.256 --> 00:08:28.800
Why the fuck
did you ride in the ambulance?

00:08:28.884 --> 00:08:32.011
I thought she was dying. I'm not
just gonna fucking leave her there, am I?

00:08:32.513 --> 00:08:33.679
- Would you?
- Yes.

00:08:33.764 --> 00:08:35.682
It was a dumb dick move.

00:08:35.765 --> 00:08:39.061
Once you called it in, your ID
was flashing lights and sounding whistles

00:08:39.144 --> 00:08:40.604
from here to Regent's Park.

00:08:40.687 --> 00:08:42.272
That's why that Dog was waiting for you.

00:08:44.358 --> 00:08:45.859
Wait, how did you know I was here?

00:08:45.943 --> 00:08:47.319
'Cause once you went walkabout,

00:08:47.402 --> 00:08:50.030
- I got Ho to monitor the Park's alerts.
- Why?

00:08:50.113 --> 00:08:52.282
In case you did something
as stupid as you did.

00:09:04.545 --> 00:09:05.629
Okay.

00:09:05.712 --> 00:09:08.590
They-- They say she might live.

00:09:08.674 --> 00:09:09.842
Thank Christ.

00:09:14.388 --> 00:09:15.556
No thanks to you.

00:09:23.313 --> 00:09:24.606
<i>No indication as yet</i>

00:09:24.690 --> 00:09:27.067
<i>that the authorities know
where Hassan is being held.</i>

00:10:04.354 --> 00:10:05.480
<i>Police are now saying</i>

00:10:05.564 --> 00:10:10.068
<i>the threat to Leeds University student
Hassan is grave and imminent.</i>

00:10:10.152 --> 00:10:13.071
<i>His liaison officers remain
with Hassan's parents,</i>

00:10:13.155 --> 00:10:16.283
<i>but it has been some hours
since anyone has been seen</i>

00:10:16.366 --> 00:10:18.952
<i>entering or, indeed, leaving the house.</i>

00:10:19.036 --> 00:10:21.955
<i>Well, I believe we can go
to a live press briefing</i>

00:10:22.039 --> 00:10:24.541
- <i>being given by West Yorkshire Police.</i>
- Yeah?

00:10:24.625 --> 00:10:27.377
Cartwright's gone. I think it was Lamb.

00:10:27.461 --> 00:10:28.462
<i>Find them.</i>

00:10:29.046 --> 00:10:31.882
<i>Hassan Ahmed was here
after he left this comedy club,</i>

00:10:31.965 --> 00:10:33.550
<i>The Last Laugh, at approximately 11…</i>

00:10:41.767 --> 00:10:42.935
Slough House?

00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:44.978
Why have you brought me back here?

00:10:45.604 --> 00:10:46.688
Because you're my agent,

00:10:46.772 --> 00:10:49.191
and you were there
when another of my agents was shot,

00:10:49.274 --> 00:10:51.276
so I'm doing your debrief.

00:10:51.777 --> 00:10:54.196
What the hell
were you two doing at Hobden's?

00:10:55.864 --> 00:10:58.200
He's got something on his laptop
that the Park want.

00:10:58.283 --> 00:11:00.452
I think he's connected to the kidnappers.

00:11:00.536 --> 00:11:02.454
Sid thought this too?

00:11:03.247 --> 00:11:04.998
Well, she followed me following Hobden.

00:11:07.376 --> 00:11:10.379
She told me she'd been put
in Slough House to watch me.

00:11:13.090 --> 00:11:16.510
Was that before
or after she got shot in the head?

00:11:29.064 --> 00:11:30.107
Who was it?

00:11:30.899 --> 00:11:32.025
Who was what?

00:11:32.109 --> 00:11:33.986
Who shot her, you pillock?

00:11:34.069 --> 00:11:37.698
I don't know. I couldn't see his face.
He had a balaclava on and tactical gear.

00:11:38.198 --> 00:11:39.366
So, a pro?

00:11:40.742 --> 00:11:43.620
Yeah. But-- Well, kind of.

00:11:44.246 --> 00:11:45.622
For fuck's sake, Cartwright.

00:11:45.706 --> 00:11:47.165
- I--
- God.

00:11:47.791 --> 00:11:50.294
Can you let me think
for one minute? Would that be fine?

00:11:54.256 --> 00:11:56.466
I don't know. It was strange.
It was like he--

00:11:57.176 --> 00:11:59.636
he wanted me to think
that he was one of the Dogs.

00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:02.806
But it just-- It wasn't quite right.

00:12:05.726 --> 00:12:09.146
And he didn't speak the whole time.

00:12:12.149 --> 00:12:14.276
Like he was worried
I might recognize his voice.

00:12:14.359 --> 00:12:15.360
God.

00:12:35.464 --> 00:12:39.510
There's your answer, Cartwright.
Jed fucking Moody.

00:12:40.219 --> 00:12:43.430
If you had issues with him,
I could have spoken to HR.

00:12:43.514 --> 00:12:44.806
No, we didn't know it was him.

00:12:44.890 --> 00:12:47.142
- He jumped out.
- I'm not sure that counts as a defense.

00:12:47.226 --> 00:12:48.644
He had a gun.

00:12:48.727 --> 00:12:50.229
Better. He used it earlier.

00:12:50.312 --> 00:12:53.232
- Shot Sid Baker with it.
- What, he killed Sid? Why?

00:12:53.315 --> 00:12:54.900
No. She's fine. She's alive.

00:12:54.983 --> 00:12:56.235
She was 20 minutes ago.

00:12:56.318 --> 00:12:59.446
But wait. Why the fuck did he shoot her?
Where were they?

00:13:00.614 --> 00:13:03.534
We were at Robert Hobden's.
Sid followed me. I never asked her to.

00:13:03.617 --> 00:13:05.077
What was Moody doing there?

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:08.080
I don't know why he was there.
He broke in dressed like this.

00:13:08.163 --> 00:13:10.832
- What was he doing here?
- Well, we didn't get a chance to ask.

00:13:10.916 --> 00:13:13.210
But he'd been in your office.

00:13:13.293 --> 00:13:15.003
Your corkboard was off the wall.

00:13:18.382 --> 00:13:20.425
Can you account for your movements?

00:13:20.509 --> 00:13:23.512
- Well, we were over the road. And…
- In the pub.

00:13:24.847 --> 00:13:26.056
Fuck me.

00:13:26.139 --> 00:13:29.685
If this is nicer than going back
to your place, I pity you.

00:13:31.270 --> 00:13:32.521
Where's the gun?

00:13:32.604 --> 00:13:33.647
It's over there.

00:13:35.065 --> 00:13:36.191
He looked like using it?

00:13:39.278 --> 00:13:41.947
Look, let's get this straight.
This is not a court of law.

00:13:42.030 --> 00:13:43.949
Did he look like using it?

00:13:44.032 --> 00:13:46.201
He didn't point it exactly, no.

00:13:46.285 --> 00:13:48.871
Yeah, well, you might want to reconsider
your position on that.

00:13:50.664 --> 00:13:52.374
- I didn't mean to kill him.
- Of course you didn't.

00:13:52.457 --> 00:13:54.293
If you meant to kill him,
he'd still be alive.

00:13:56.211 --> 00:13:57.254
What's this?

00:13:59.047 --> 00:14:00.299
Dirty bastard.

00:14:00.382 --> 00:14:01.967
What, was he gonna bug your office?

00:14:02.926 --> 00:14:05.596
It'd be an odd move
after shooting one of my joes.

00:14:06.722 --> 00:14:08.473
No, he was cleaning up.

00:14:09.266 --> 00:14:10.309
Prior to getting out.

00:14:11.101 --> 00:14:12.102
Well…

00:14:12.603 --> 00:14:14.521
the prostitutes of Paraguay,

00:14:14.605 --> 00:14:17.608
or whichever non-extradition destination
he was headed for,

00:14:17.691 --> 00:14:19.234
have had a lucky escape.

00:14:26.742 --> 00:14:28.410
Two mobiles.

00:14:29.036 --> 00:14:30.329
Jed, Jed, Jed.

00:14:31.246 --> 00:14:33.540
I'm surprised
you had enough friends to carry one.

00:14:35.876 --> 00:14:39.588
This one's barely used.
Just one incoming call.

00:14:39.671 --> 00:14:40.672
You should ring it.

00:14:42.299 --> 00:14:44.092
Thank fuck you're here.

00:14:45.093 --> 00:14:46.845
I would never have thought of that.

00:14:51.517 --> 00:14:52.851
<i>Moody?</i>

00:14:52.935 --> 00:14:55.646
I'm afraid he can't come
to the phone right now.

00:14:56.605 --> 00:14:57.814
<i>Jackson.</i>

00:14:57.898 --> 00:14:59.358
We need to talk.

00:15:03.487 --> 00:15:04.488
Come on.

00:15:06.281 --> 00:15:08.325
- Yes?
- I need to see him.

00:15:08.408 --> 00:15:09.743
It's very late, sir.

00:15:09.826 --> 00:15:12.246
- I know that. Is he here?
- Who shall I say, sir?

00:15:12.329 --> 00:15:14.122
Hobden. It's Robert Hobden.

00:15:16.625 --> 00:15:19.378
Just save us all a lot of back and forth.

00:15:19.461 --> 00:15:21.880
Just tell him,
if he's not receiving guests now,

00:15:21.964 --> 00:15:24.299
he will need to make himself available
in the morning,

00:15:24.383 --> 00:15:28.387
'cause there will be cameras out front
and tabloids trying to get in the back.

00:15:39.898 --> 00:15:40.941
Wait here.

00:15:57.708 --> 00:16:01.295
Robert Hobden, as I live and breathe
and shag like a lord.

00:16:01.378 --> 00:16:02.963
Good to see you, old chum.

00:16:03.630 --> 00:16:04.882
Timing's a little off.

00:16:04.965 --> 00:16:07.634
But when a friend drops by,
my door is always open,

00:16:07.718 --> 00:16:10.345
and my wine is waiting to be uncorked.

00:16:10.429 --> 00:16:12.181
I've got this, Seb.
Give us a moment, would you?

00:16:13.974 --> 00:16:17.060
What the fuck are you doing here,
you stupid fucking twat?

00:16:17.144 --> 00:16:18.979
I have been trying to contact you.

00:16:19.062 --> 00:16:22.566
I've been avoiding your calls.
Take the hint. You're fucking toxic.

00:16:22.649 --> 00:16:24.568
- Did anyone see you arrive?
- I don't know.

00:16:24.651 --> 00:16:27.821
- What kind of prick answer is that?
- It's the only prick answer I've got.

00:16:29.198 --> 00:16:30.199
What happened?

00:16:31.241 --> 00:16:33.577
Someone tried to kill me tonight.

00:16:33.660 --> 00:16:34.912
Well, a lot of fanatics about.

00:16:34.995 --> 00:16:37.873
- You're not the most popular--
- It wasn't a fanatic. It was a spook.

00:16:37.956 --> 00:16:38.957
A spook?

00:16:39.041 --> 00:16:43.253
MI5 sent a man, masked man, to my flat,
with a gun, to get my laptop.

00:16:43.337 --> 00:16:46.548
Fucking hell! I don't know where
anything is. I hardly ever come in here.

00:16:47.925 --> 00:16:50.344
Why would MI5 want your computer?

00:16:50.427 --> 00:16:54.473
Because I have intel about the kidnapping.
The Muslim boy.

00:16:54.556 --> 00:16:56.058
Why should I care about the kidnapping?

00:16:56.141 --> 00:16:59.478
I've already made enough of a tit
of myself, claiming it was ISIS.

00:16:59.561 --> 00:17:03.357
Because your entire career has been
playing the nationalist card.

00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:06.401
And if that boy dies,
the closest you'll get to Downing Street

00:17:06.484 --> 00:17:09.195
is looking down on it
from an open-top bus.

00:17:34.012 --> 00:17:35.055
You alone?

00:17:38.684 --> 00:17:41.228
Don't know why
they had to clean up the canals.

00:17:42.855 --> 00:17:45.399
There was a time
you could find an oil drum

00:17:45.482 --> 00:17:48.485
or a corpse to use as a target.

00:17:58.412 --> 00:17:59.955
What do you think you're playing at?

00:18:00.664 --> 00:18:03.333
Well, that's fucking choice,
considering I lent you an agent

00:18:03.417 --> 00:18:05.252
for what you said was
a run-of-the-mill op,

00:18:05.335 --> 00:18:06.879
who now has a bullet in her head.

00:18:07.504 --> 00:18:09.423
"What do you think you're playing at?"
is my line,

00:18:09.506 --> 00:18:11.425
with a few fucking fucks thrown in.

00:18:11.508 --> 00:18:13.969
I'm sorry, but the brief was not
for her to be on Hobden 24/7.

00:18:14.052 --> 00:18:16.221
No, the brief was
to be on Cartwright 24/7.

00:18:16.305 --> 00:18:19.808
Which makes me think
she was your agent all along,

00:18:19.892 --> 00:18:21.727
and you were just asking for show.

00:18:23.478 --> 00:18:27.357
- Where was she when she was--
- She was shot outside Hobden's.

00:18:28.192 --> 00:18:33.488
Intentionally or otherwise, by Jed Moody,
another one of your recruits.

00:18:33.572 --> 00:18:35.115
So, if I may be so bold,

00:18:35.199 --> 00:18:37.201
what the living fuck do you think
you're playing at?

00:18:37.284 --> 00:18:39.203
Check the rule book, Lamb.

00:18:39.912 --> 00:18:42.748
You run Slough House, and God knows
no one wants to take that away from you,

00:18:42.831 --> 00:18:45.542
but I am Second Desk, head of ops,

00:18:45.626 --> 00:18:47.377
which means directing personnel.

00:18:47.461 --> 00:18:50.380
All personnel. Yours or anybody else's.

00:18:53.926 --> 00:18:55.052
Better out than in.

00:18:56.303 --> 00:18:57.846
God, you're vile.

00:18:58.805 --> 00:19:00.390
Actually, maybe not.

00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:05.270
So, say you're right
and this is none of my business,

00:19:06.146 --> 00:19:08.815
what do I do about the body
on my staircase?

00:19:10.567 --> 00:19:11.985
- Moody?
- Yeah.

00:19:13.111 --> 00:19:14.112
He's dead?

00:19:14.196 --> 00:19:17.282
It's hard to tell, given his IQ, but yes.

00:19:17.366 --> 00:19:18.659
- Jesus.
- Yeah.

00:19:18.742 --> 00:19:22.371
But if you wanted to subcontract,
you could've done better than Jed Moody.

00:19:22.454 --> 00:19:26.625
Even when he was good, he wasn't any good.
The guy's a fucking fridge magnet.

00:19:26.708 --> 00:19:28.001
- Who took him down?
- W--

00:19:28.502 --> 00:19:31.630
Here's the funny part.
He forgot to tie his shoelaces.

00:19:31.713 --> 00:19:34.258
He fell down the stairs.

00:19:36.760 --> 00:19:38.470
Yes. When you're in front of Limitations,

00:19:38.554 --> 00:19:40.973
you might want to leave out
the bit about that being funny.

00:19:42.724 --> 00:19:44.017
Limitations.

00:19:45.811 --> 00:19:47.479
So, do we call in the Dogs?

00:19:47.563 --> 00:19:49.481
Hell, it's a death, Diana.

00:19:49.565 --> 00:19:52.192
I could call the police. I should.

00:19:52.276 --> 00:19:54.236
I've got a mobile phone on me.

00:19:54.319 --> 00:19:56.280
Yeah, I could use that.

00:19:56.363 --> 00:19:58.073
Yeah, I found it on Moody's body.

00:19:59.116 --> 00:20:01.743
The odd thing is,
the only number in it is yours.

00:20:01.827 --> 00:20:03.412
Yeah, you've made your point.

00:20:06.206 --> 00:20:08.000
It's after 02:00, Diana.

00:20:08.083 --> 00:20:10.335
And my team is smaller
than it was yesterday.

00:20:10.419 --> 00:20:14.631
You've got till I finish this fag
before I start making calls.

00:20:17.176 --> 00:20:18.177
Okay.

00:20:19.845 --> 00:20:22.848
I was talking to my brother
at the Frontline Club.

00:20:24.057 --> 00:20:27.394
And I mentioned we were developing
operations to neutralize the nationalists.

00:20:27.477 --> 00:20:29.146
You are fucking kidding me.

00:20:29.229 --> 00:20:33.066
Sons of Albion have links to groups
all under Simmonds's umbrella.

00:20:33.150 --> 00:20:35.027
I can use this to roll them all up.

00:20:35.110 --> 00:20:37.946
So, you set up some half-arsed scheme

00:20:38.030 --> 00:20:42.034
involving a neofascist group
kidnapping a Muslim kid

00:20:42.117 --> 00:20:44.745
and threatening to chop his head off
on YouTube?

00:20:44.828 --> 00:20:47.873
Except it's not going to happen
'cause one of the group is yours.

00:20:47.956 --> 00:20:49.249
- Close?
- Half-arsed?

00:20:49.333 --> 00:20:52.586
One dead and one in intensive care
because what?

00:20:52.669 --> 00:20:55.172
You think
Hobden's got a piece of the puzzle?

00:20:56.715 --> 00:20:58.634
When I went to the bar
at the Frontline Club,

00:20:58.717 --> 00:21:00.802
I saw Hobden in the booth behind us.

00:21:01.970 --> 00:21:04.681
Bad tradecraft on my part, no question.

00:21:05.265 --> 00:21:08.852
You thought he might have
overheard you or recorded it?

00:21:08.936 --> 00:21:10.979
That's why you needed to know what he had.

00:21:16.026 --> 00:21:17.152
Do you have any proof?

00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:21.615
No, but MI5 must think I do.
That's why they tried to kill me tonight.

00:21:21.698 --> 00:21:24.368
And you come here,
leaving a trail of mad, shitty footprints.

00:21:24.451 --> 00:21:28.205
- I don't want to be caught up in this.
- You're already caught up in this.

00:21:28.288 --> 00:21:30.999
You have to warn them and get them out!

00:21:31.083 --> 00:21:32.167
And say what?

00:21:32.793 --> 00:21:38.006
Tell them that this whole setup,
this supposed execution, is a fake.

00:21:38.090 --> 00:21:41.593
That the Sons of Albion, who've never been
more than a bunch of moronic street thugs,

00:21:41.677 --> 00:21:43.929
have been set up
by the intelligence services.

00:21:44.012 --> 00:21:45.764
By an agent provocateur.

00:21:45.848 --> 00:21:48.141
And I'm to, what,
announce this in the House?

00:21:48.225 --> 00:21:49.309
Or maybe on the <i>Today</i> program?

00:21:49.393 --> 00:21:52.771
Peter, we've known each other for years.
Don't try and fob me off.

00:21:52.855 --> 00:21:54.648
We are not friends, Robert.

00:21:54.731 --> 00:21:56.859
You've always treated me fairly in print,
and I respect that.

00:21:56.942 --> 00:21:58.485
But let's face it,
you're a fucking has-been,

00:21:58.569 --> 00:22:01.154
and it's no longer appropriate
to be associated with you.

00:22:02.197 --> 00:22:03.407
So take it somewhere else.

00:22:03.490 --> 00:22:05.576
Maybe to your pals
in the British Patriotic Party.

00:22:05.659 --> 00:22:07.160
What? They won't believe me.

00:22:07.244 --> 00:22:10.497
Well, I can't warn these Sons of Whatever.
I don't know the fuckers.

00:22:10.581 --> 00:22:13.125
But you know people who know people.

00:22:13.208 --> 00:22:15.085
You have to warn them.

00:22:15.169 --> 00:22:18.505
You have to get the word out.
A spy's in their midst.

00:22:18.589 --> 00:22:21.717
A rescue will be staged,
and they will all be killed.

00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:24.094
I'm a respected
and much-loved national figure.

00:22:24.178 --> 00:22:27.222
I don't have any of the contacts
you're talking about, you mad bastard.

00:22:27.306 --> 00:22:28.765
Peter, you're needed!

00:22:30.184 --> 00:22:31.393
The second I go upstairs,

00:22:31.476 --> 00:22:33.645
you get the fuck out of here,
or I'll have Seb drag you out.

00:22:33.729 --> 00:22:35.439
I have the photo of you at the rally.

00:22:35.522 --> 00:22:39.610
Darling, Nahim and Ursula
are going to go very soon.

00:22:39.693 --> 00:22:42.905
Already? And skipping cheese, are they?
I'll see about that.

00:22:42.988 --> 00:22:44.948
Let's open some port
and tempt them to stay.

00:22:45.449 --> 00:22:47.242
Would your friend care to join us?

00:22:47.326 --> 00:22:50.412
Rob and I have been discussing some
very official secret hush-hush, darling.

00:22:50.495 --> 00:22:52.122
No one's supposed to know he's here.

00:22:52.873 --> 00:22:54.249
You wait here, bud.

00:22:54.333 --> 00:22:57.544
I'll settle things upstairs
and be back in a jiffy.

00:23:04.843 --> 00:23:07.888
I can't help but notice you seem,
you know, pretty relaxed

00:23:07.971 --> 00:23:10.140
for someone who set up
a false flag operation

00:23:10.224 --> 00:23:14.728
to behead an innocent kid
in what… four hours.

00:23:15.270 --> 00:23:16.563
They're not gonna do it.

00:23:16.647 --> 00:23:19.441
Their core messaging suggests
they very much are.

00:23:19.525 --> 00:23:22.152
Our agent told them
they didn't actually need a beheading.

00:23:22.236 --> 00:23:24.738
They just had to show
that they could do it if pushed.

00:23:25.572 --> 00:23:27.991
That's a hell of a gamble.
I wouldn't fancy your odds.

00:23:28.075 --> 00:23:29.326
You underestimate me.

00:23:30.410 --> 00:23:31.662
The boy was chosen with care.

00:23:33.539 --> 00:23:34.790
The kid. Who is he?

00:23:35.374 --> 00:23:37.960
He's Mahmud Gul's nephew. Gul is--

00:23:38.043 --> 00:23:40.838
I know who Mahmud fucking Gul is.

00:23:40.921 --> 00:23:44.049
He's number two
in Pakistan's military intelligence.

00:23:44.132 --> 00:23:45.592
And this gets you what?

00:23:45.676 --> 00:23:47.010
We will rescue his nephew,

00:23:47.094 --> 00:23:50.973
and if that gets us even 10%
more cooperation with the Pakistanis,

00:23:51.056 --> 00:23:52.099
it will be worth it.

00:23:52.182 --> 00:23:54.935
If this goes tits up-- and Christ knows
it hasn't gone right yet--

00:23:55.018 --> 00:23:57.396
you've assassinated his nephew!

00:23:57.479 --> 00:24:00.148
- Our man is--
- "Your man."

00:24:00.941 --> 00:24:03.402
This isn't a sanctioned service op, Diana.

00:24:03.485 --> 00:24:05.070
This is off the books!

00:24:05.153 --> 00:24:08.866
This is pirate shit!
Now you've got Hobden in the wind!

00:24:10.075 --> 00:24:11.243
You gotta roll this up!

00:24:12.536 --> 00:24:13.954
- It can still work.
- It--

00:24:14.037 --> 00:24:17.958
- This can neutralize the far right.
- It can't.

00:24:35.350 --> 00:24:37.102
How the fuck is he sleepin'?

00:24:37.644 --> 00:24:40.772
I know I couldn't sleep with what he
thinks is about to happen. I know that.

00:24:42.733 --> 00:24:44.568
He won't have slept since we grabbed him.

00:24:45.694 --> 00:24:47.321
He must be exhausted.

00:24:47.404 --> 00:24:49.489
You wanna go down
and sing him a lullaby, do you?

00:24:55.996 --> 00:24:56.997
Fuck's sake.

00:24:58.624 --> 00:24:59.666
I'll mute it.

00:25:01.043 --> 00:25:02.211
Can still see the lights.

00:25:50.509 --> 00:25:51.927
- Little fucker!
- Bastard!

00:25:52.594 --> 00:25:53.971
Come on then.

00:25:56.223 --> 00:25:57.391
Get down there.

00:25:58.225 --> 00:26:01.061
Help! Somebody help me!

00:26:01.812 --> 00:26:03.230
Somebody help me, please!

00:26:03.313 --> 00:26:04.481
- Grab his legs!
- No, no.

00:26:04.565 --> 00:26:07.442
- Somebody help me! No!
- Get him down from there!

00:26:07.526 --> 00:26:10.696
- Help me! Help me! Help!
- Get the fucker out of here.

00:26:13.448 --> 00:26:15.117
Just humor me and explore the flip side.

00:26:15.701 --> 00:26:18.287
If those Sons of Nonsense get wind
of what you're up to,

00:26:18.370 --> 00:26:20.539
that kid is as good as dead,
and your man too.

00:26:20.622 --> 00:26:22.916
You've gotta call him
and tell him his cover's blown.

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:25.711
Not possible.
He wanted them to go dark. No phones.

00:26:26.378 --> 00:26:28.297
Send in the Dogs early.

00:26:28.881 --> 00:26:31.383
If we bring it forward,
we need to let him know

00:26:31.466 --> 00:26:33.343
so he can secure Hassan
and get out himself.

00:26:33.427 --> 00:26:35.846
- Yeah. Well, lots of luck with that one.
- You're gonna help me.

00:26:35.929 --> 00:26:38.390
Oh, no, I'm not.
And nor are any of my people.

00:26:38.473 --> 00:26:39.766
They brought the boy to London.

00:26:39.850 --> 00:26:42.102
They're holding him in a house
this side of the river.

00:26:42.186 --> 00:26:44.855
All I'm asking you to do is
literally knock on the door.

00:26:44.938 --> 00:26:46.523
Our man will answer, and…

00:26:47.649 --> 00:26:49.943
- What's the signal?
- Your face is the signal.

00:26:50.777 --> 00:26:51.987
My face?

00:26:52.070 --> 00:26:54.573
You're a legend in the service, Jackson.

00:26:55.407 --> 00:26:58.493
He'll recognize your face
and know something's about to go down.

00:26:58.577 --> 00:27:01.705
He'll secure Hassan,
and Dogs will be right behind you.

00:27:01.788 --> 00:27:03.790
They'll go in and do the dirty work.

00:27:06.543 --> 00:27:09.046
I've got other things
I could do tonight, Diana.

00:27:09.796 --> 00:27:12.174
I've got a really massive shit brewin'.

00:27:12.257 --> 00:27:14.968
I could sit and read a book
and birth that beauty.

00:27:19.473 --> 00:27:21.058
Was Moody alone when he died?

00:27:21.808 --> 00:27:24.269
We're all alone in the end,
don't you think, Diana?

00:27:24.353 --> 00:27:25.854
In those final moments?

00:27:25.938 --> 00:27:27.648
If he did have company,

00:27:28.315 --> 00:27:31.401
that company might
come under intense scrutiny.

00:27:31.485 --> 00:27:33.362
By all means, call in the Dogs.

00:27:33.445 --> 00:27:35.322
And when they're finished
tearing you apart,

00:27:35.405 --> 00:27:38.367
maybe they'll have enough strength
to pick at the rest of this.

00:27:38.450 --> 00:27:40.619
Either way, I couldn't give a monkey's.

00:27:41.286 --> 00:27:43.080
Even if it was Standish?

00:27:45.791 --> 00:27:48.377
You're tossin' darts.

00:27:48.460 --> 00:27:50.838
Standish wasn't there.
She's at home asleep.

00:27:50.921 --> 00:27:52.673
I'm not talking about tonight.

00:27:52.756 --> 00:27:55.592
I'm talking about the night
Charles Partner died.

00:27:56.510 --> 00:28:00.764
Catherine Standish came very close
to a treason charge.

00:28:01.849 --> 00:28:04.393
That file could be reopened, reassessed.

00:28:04.476 --> 00:28:06.895
Didn't fly then. It won't fly now.

00:28:06.979 --> 00:28:08.939
A lot of other things might come out.

00:28:12.484 --> 00:28:15.737
That is not a can of worms
you want to open.

00:28:15.821 --> 00:28:17.489
Do I look keen?

00:28:20.909 --> 00:28:22.995
Like it or not,
Slough House is part of this now.

00:28:23.078 --> 00:28:24.746
You'll all get turned over.

00:28:25.247 --> 00:28:29.209
Standish will find out some things
it would be better for her not to know.

00:28:41.388 --> 00:28:43.348
I'll go knock on the door for you.

00:28:45.809 --> 00:28:49.605
But in return, I want the Standish file.

00:28:52.482 --> 00:28:56.069
And you've been using Slough House
as your personal toy box,

00:28:56.153 --> 00:28:57.279
which pisses me off.

00:28:57.362 --> 00:28:58.780
- Are we clear?
- Crystal.

00:28:58.864 --> 00:29:00.073
There's more.

00:29:01.700 --> 00:29:03.577
Moody disappears.

00:29:04.745 --> 00:29:07.706
Baker, a victim of street crime.

00:29:08.540 --> 00:29:11.376
Anyone with me tonight is fireproof.

00:29:12.961 --> 00:29:15.839
And you are in my debt
until you're in a care home.

00:29:15.923 --> 00:29:18.091
God, you really care about them,
don't you?

00:29:19.718 --> 00:29:22.930
Nah. I think
they're a bunch of fucking losers.

00:29:24.848 --> 00:29:26.266
But they're my losers.

00:29:30.479 --> 00:29:32.397
For what it's worth,
I'm sorry about Baker.

00:29:32.940 --> 00:29:35.108
I'll have that marked on her chart.

00:29:36.109 --> 00:29:38.779
You know, the one that clips
to the bottom of her bed

00:29:38.862 --> 00:29:40.989
that tells you
when her catheter needs changin'.

00:29:49.998 --> 00:29:55.170
I apologize for the threat,
but I do need you to listen to me.

00:29:55.754 --> 00:29:56.755
Don't you see?

00:29:56.839 --> 00:30:00.175
They want everyone to forget

00:30:00.259 --> 00:30:04.096
about body parts on the tube.

00:30:04.179 --> 00:30:08.016
Madmen with swords,
hacking people to bits on bridges.

00:30:08.100 --> 00:30:09.476
But instead, we'll have footage

00:30:09.560 --> 00:30:13.647
of our brave spooks
rescuin' some brown-skinned boy

00:30:13.730 --> 00:30:16.358
and paintin' the right
as a bunch of murdering bastards.

00:30:18.944 --> 00:30:20.612
Do you want them to get away with it?

00:30:20.696 --> 00:30:25.075
This will stop you from taking your party
and your country further to the right.

00:30:26.410 --> 00:30:28.287
That ground will be poisoned,

00:30:28.370 --> 00:30:33.083
and there'll be a swing
to happy-clappy, rainbow Britain.

00:30:33.959 --> 00:30:35.460
Where the rights of the minority

00:30:35.544 --> 00:30:38.422
drown out the rights
of the true-born majority,

00:30:38.505 --> 00:30:40.174
and you'll have to go along with it.

00:30:40.257 --> 00:30:43.844
And that will pain you.
And I know that you're with me on this.

00:30:46.138 --> 00:30:50.392
Now I don't want to have to use that photo
to make you do this.

00:30:50.475 --> 00:30:52.269
I want you to do this willingly.

00:30:59.234 --> 00:31:01.069
Listen to me, fucko.

00:31:01.987 --> 00:31:03.739
That photo doesn't exist.

00:31:04.239 --> 00:31:06.158
If it did, anyone who was in it

00:31:06.241 --> 00:31:09.369
would make sure all copies
and negatives were destroyed.

00:31:10.579 --> 00:31:14.416
But say it did exist
and you somehow had a copy.

00:31:15.042 --> 00:31:18.253
I can brush it off
quicker than you can cream your piles.

00:31:19.004 --> 00:31:20.547
"It's photoshopped.

00:31:20.631 --> 00:31:23.050
It's a wave, not a Nazi salute.

00:31:23.133 --> 00:31:25.677
It was fancy dress.
Poor taste, but not a crime.

00:31:26.303 --> 00:31:29.097
I was young and drunk and stupid,

00:31:29.181 --> 00:31:32.017
and this is not the man
I know myself to be.

00:31:32.100 --> 00:31:34.394
Here's ten grand
to an anti-fascist group."

00:31:36.355 --> 00:31:39.816
Now get the fuck out of my house before
I punch you so hard, I break my fist.

00:31:47.866 --> 00:31:48.867
Seb.

00:31:54.665 --> 00:31:57.417
You want me to follow him?
Warn him off a return visit?

00:31:57.501 --> 00:32:00.045
No, but I'll need you to make some calls.

00:32:00.128 --> 00:32:02.923
Fuck! That was close.

00:32:04.091 --> 00:32:08.303
He is a horrible, slippery little prick.

00:32:08.887 --> 00:32:10.973
Yeah. Well, he's not goin' anywhere now,

00:32:11.557 --> 00:32:13.225
so if either of you wanna doze off.

00:32:13.308 --> 00:32:14.977
Nah. I'm pretty wired now.

00:32:15.060 --> 00:32:18.272
No. I'm stayin' awake,
because I don't trust this little bastard.

00:32:18.355 --> 00:32:21.775
Easy. All in good time. All in good time.

00:32:21.859 --> 00:32:23.443
Where's fucking laughing boy?

00:32:23.527 --> 00:32:26.363
Don't know. Probably upstairs,
havin' a bubble bath.

00:32:28.073 --> 00:32:29.700
All right, let's have some fun then.

00:32:31.451 --> 00:32:33.370
Might as well make some money off you two.

00:32:35.330 --> 00:32:36.331
Who's in?

00:32:36.832 --> 00:32:38.792
- I'm all for a game of cards.
- Yeah, all right.

00:32:39.501 --> 00:32:41.378
Let's get rid of some of these bottles.

00:32:41.461 --> 00:32:43.297
- Don't be falling asleep in there.
- Yeah, go on.

00:32:54.308 --> 00:32:55.517
What happened to the gun?

00:33:00.314 --> 00:33:02.733
All right. Come on, pillocks.

00:33:12.659 --> 00:33:15.120
Keep an eye on the place, eh, Jed?

00:33:18.999 --> 00:33:21.627
- Has anyone else got a car here?
- I have.

00:33:21.710 --> 00:33:24.630
- You in a fit state to drive?
- I can drive.

00:33:24.713 --> 00:33:26.340
I hold my drink better than Min.

00:33:26.423 --> 00:33:28.800
All right. Cartwright, you're with me.

00:33:29.927 --> 00:33:31.261
You two fuckbirds follow.

00:33:31.345 --> 00:33:32.554
Where we going?

00:33:32.638 --> 00:33:34.306
Roupell Street. South of the river.

00:33:34.389 --> 00:33:36.058
- Why?
- To assist with the rescue

00:33:36.141 --> 00:33:37.226
of Hassan Ahmed.

00:33:43.690 --> 00:33:44.691
<i>Speaking this morning,</i>

00:33:44.775 --> 00:33:47.069
<i>the Prime Minister described
the kidnappers as pure evil.</i>

00:33:47.152 --> 00:33:48.987
<i>Government is doing
plenty of tough talking…</i>

00:33:49.071 --> 00:33:53.200
<i>The kidnappers are claiming to be
from a group called the Sons of Albion.</i>

00:33:53.283 --> 00:33:54.910
<i>…despicable and ghastly acts.</i>

00:33:54.993 --> 00:33:57.829
<i>The fear is that
another British citizen is going to die…</i>

00:33:57.913 --> 00:34:00.040
<i>The British government now finds itself</i>

00:34:00.123 --> 00:34:02.918
<i>fighting international terrorism
on its home turf.</i>

00:34:03.001 --> 00:34:07.089
<i>…as extremely worrying
and added the investigation continues…</i>

00:34:07.172 --> 00:34:09.757
<i>The deadline set
by the men holding Hassan Ahmed</i>

00:34:09.842 --> 00:34:12.386
<i>is now less than four hours away.</i>

00:34:27.109 --> 00:34:29.527
Proceed. Lamb will knock. You clean up.

00:34:29.610 --> 00:34:30.445
Go!

00:35:01.268 --> 00:35:03.478
- It was money, wasn't it?
- What?

00:35:03.562 --> 00:35:06.023
"What?" Come on.
In that envelope you took off Moody.

00:35:06.106 --> 00:35:09.151
It's your flight fund,
in case you need to make a run for it.

00:35:09.234 --> 00:35:12.613
Flight fund?
Why, I haven't heard that for a long time.

00:35:12.696 --> 00:35:15.782
- Where'd you get that? Your grandfather?
- How much?

00:35:16.617 --> 00:35:18.035
Fifteen hundred,

00:35:18.118 --> 00:35:21.246
a passport and a key to a box.

00:35:21.330 --> 00:35:23.207
- Switzerland?
- Fuck you, Switzerland.

00:35:23.290 --> 00:35:27.544
Bank in a two-donkey French town
four hours' drive from Paris.

00:35:27.628 --> 00:35:29.046
Why am I telling you all this?

00:35:30.380 --> 00:35:32.382
Probably so you'd have
an excuse to kill me.

00:35:33.050 --> 00:35:34.468
That's probably it.

00:35:42.184 --> 00:35:43.810
Home Office, ma'am. Barrowby.

00:35:44.561 --> 00:35:47.105
Tell him I'm operational.
I'll call him back when I can.

00:35:47.606 --> 00:35:48.607
Yes, ma'am.

00:35:52.569 --> 00:35:54.821
Do you think he can breathe in there?

00:35:54.905 --> 00:35:55.989
Get a move on.

00:35:56.073 --> 00:35:57.574
He hasn't moved in ages.

00:35:57.658 --> 00:35:59.243
That's 'cause he's tied to a chair.

00:36:03.914 --> 00:36:05.499
You can breathe, can't you?

00:36:06.875 --> 00:36:09.419
Don't piss about. Nod.
I know you can hear me.

00:36:09.503 --> 00:36:10.504
See? He's fine.

00:36:14.675 --> 00:36:15.676
Fifteen.

00:36:18.929 --> 00:36:19.763
Call.

00:36:21.890 --> 00:36:22.891
Fifteen.

00:36:24.601 --> 00:36:25.811
Where have you been?

00:36:26.562 --> 00:36:27.980
Hugging a pillow and crying?

00:36:30.732 --> 00:36:32.943
Hey, what were you doing up there?

00:36:33.527 --> 00:36:34.528
Just thinking.

00:36:35.112 --> 00:36:36.905
Thought I heard a dull clang.

00:36:37.781 --> 00:36:39.283
Want me to deal you in?

00:36:39.366 --> 00:36:41.076
Playing for real money though.

00:36:41.159 --> 00:36:42.786
You may not have the stones for that.

00:36:43.620 --> 00:36:45.038
I'll raise another 30.

00:36:45.831 --> 00:36:47.124
What regiment were you in?

00:36:47.207 --> 00:36:49.168
- What?
- In the army.

00:36:50.210 --> 00:36:52.629
You know,
when you were out killing towelheads.

00:36:53.547 --> 00:36:54.631
Marines.

00:36:55.507 --> 00:36:56.508
Asked about the regiment--

00:36:56.592 --> 00:36:58.218
Marines don't have regiments.

00:36:58.302 --> 00:37:00.888
It's battalion units known as commandos.

00:37:00.971 --> 00:37:02.848
Stop makin' a twat of yourself.

00:37:05.726 --> 00:37:06.727
Well?

00:37:09.938 --> 00:37:10.939
All in.

00:37:17.779 --> 00:37:18.864
Bollocks to it.

00:37:21.658 --> 00:37:23.744
Looks like you two
are finally growing a dick.

00:37:24.369 --> 00:37:25.746
One between you.

00:37:26.455 --> 00:37:28.457
You haven't used one of these though,
have you?

00:37:30.876 --> 00:37:31.877
Put it down.

00:37:32.753 --> 00:37:33.754
No.

00:37:34.671 --> 00:37:36.673
It feels good in my hand.

00:37:39.760 --> 00:37:41.470
All it'd take is one swing, I reckon.

00:37:42.804 --> 00:37:44.264
Cut right through.

00:37:45.015 --> 00:37:47.267
Put it down before you fuck everything up.

00:37:48.519 --> 00:37:49.603
Hold on.

00:37:50.479 --> 00:37:52.481
So, killing him now
would fuck everything up?

00:37:55.609 --> 00:37:56.652
That's odd.

00:37:57.486 --> 00:37:59.154
I mean, what are you talkin' about, mate?

00:38:00.864 --> 00:38:03.367
I thought we were strikin' a blow
for Britain at sunrise.

00:38:05.118 --> 00:38:06.119
Look.

00:38:07.162 --> 00:38:09.665
At the end of this,
I report to Simmonds, yeah?

00:38:10.415 --> 00:38:13.544
Now, I can tell him you're a good soldier.
You get a pat on the back.

00:38:14.545 --> 00:38:19.716
Or I can tell him you're a twat liability
and have his boys break your spine.

00:38:21.301 --> 00:38:22.302
Up to you.

00:38:42.948 --> 00:38:44.074
You little prick.

00:38:45.617 --> 00:38:48.036
- Full house, dickheads.
- Bollocks.

00:38:48.120 --> 00:38:49.204
- Hey!
- No!

00:39:06.221 --> 00:39:07.598
Seems pretty quiet.

00:39:07.681 --> 00:39:11.059
What'd you expect?
Balloons tied to the door?

00:39:15.981 --> 00:39:18.734
Whoa. Why are you takin' a gun
if you just have to knock on the door?

00:39:18.817 --> 00:39:21.361
Because this whole op is fucked up.

00:39:22.404 --> 00:39:25.532
Taverner's playin' London rules,
but I'm the one in joe country,

00:39:25.616 --> 00:39:28.035
so I'll play Moscow rules. Thank you.

00:39:41.590 --> 00:39:42.591
Hey.

00:39:43.217 --> 00:39:45.052
What are you doin'?

00:39:45.135 --> 00:39:46.386
Stroking a cat.

00:40:10.827 --> 00:40:12.037
Shit!

00:40:14.081 --> 00:40:15.082
Go around the back!

00:40:20.003 --> 00:40:21.296
Lamb?

00:40:23.966 --> 00:40:24.967
Lamb?

00:40:25.634 --> 00:40:26.635
Kitchen.

00:40:37.855 --> 00:40:38.856
Oh, fuck.
