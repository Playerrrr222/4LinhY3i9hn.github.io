00:00:23.148 --> 00:00:24.441
<i>I enjoy funerals.</i>

00:00:24.524 --> 00:00:27.944
<i>I've been crashing them since I was</i>
<i>old enough to read the obituary section.</i>

00:00:29.446 --> 00:00:31.114
"God is our refuge and strength…"

00:00:31.197 --> 00:00:33.908
<i>Mayor Walker was murdered,</i>
<i>and I know the killer is here,</i>

00:00:34.659 --> 00:00:37.996
<i>standing innocently among us,</i>
<i>plotting their next move.</i>

00:00:39.122 --> 00:00:40.582
<i>And watching everything I do.</i>

00:00:43.293 --> 00:00:45.045
<i>I know I'm close to the truth.</i>

00:00:45.545 --> 00:00:47.130
<i>I have all the pieces of the jigsaw.</i>

00:00:48.673 --> 00:00:50.425
<i>I just need to slot them into place.</i>

00:01:27.504 --> 00:01:29.964
<i>I must look past the tears</i>
<i>and masks of grief.</i>

00:01:30.048 --> 00:01:33.176
<i>Until now, I may have been</i>
<i>outmatched and outmaneuvered,</i>

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:35.512
<i>but the final gambit has yet to be played.</i>

00:01:37.806 --> 00:01:39.808
<i>The killer will make a mistake,</i>

00:01:41.142 --> 00:01:42.143
<i>and I'll be ready.</i>

00:02:17.679 --> 00:02:20.807
Still as sharp as ever,
my pig-tailed protégé.

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:22.350
Uncle Fester.

00:02:39.826 --> 00:02:41.619
How long
have you been stalking me?

00:02:41.703 --> 00:02:45.123
Just blew into town this morning
and was hit by a wave of nostalgia.

00:02:45.206 --> 00:02:47.167
I thought you didn't go to Nevermore.

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.919
I didn't. Your dad got all the brains.

00:02:50.795 --> 00:02:52.547
But I used to drop in on him.

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:55.884
Usually from the ceiling
with a dagger clutched between my teeth.

00:02:55.967 --> 00:02:58.219
-Just to keep him on his toes.
-Of course.

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.055
He filled me in on what's been going on.

00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:03.558
Monsters, murder, mayhem.

00:03:04.475 --> 00:03:05.643
What fun!

00:03:06.227 --> 00:03:09.939
I told him I had a job in Boston,
but I'd be checking up on you.

00:03:10.481 --> 00:03:11.691
What kind of job?

00:03:11.774 --> 00:03:14.736
The kind that means I need somewhere
to lay low for a couple days.

00:03:27.665 --> 00:03:29.250
This place belongs to a friend.

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:32.921
You've actually made a friend.

00:03:33.004 --> 00:03:35.548
That poor kid
will be going home in a body bag.

00:03:36.674 --> 00:03:38.259
Oh.

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.889
-I like a hideout that comes with snacks.
-Those bees are hibernating.

00:03:43.473 --> 00:03:44.974
They're practically Eugene's children.

00:03:45.058 --> 00:03:46.851
-Ooh.

00:03:46.935 --> 00:03:48.728
That means do not eat them!

00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:55.777
You know,

00:03:56.861 --> 00:03:59.572
when you give me
that death stare of disapproval,

00:03:59.656 --> 00:04:00.990
you remind me of your mother.

00:04:01.616 --> 00:04:03.201
Speaking of scary things,

00:04:03.701 --> 00:04:05.954
you know what kind of monster
you're dealing with?

00:04:06.037 --> 00:04:08.122
I haven't been able to identify it.

00:04:09.082 --> 00:04:11.084
Ooh.

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:15.380
It's called a Hyde.

00:04:16.714 --> 00:04:17.715
As in Jekyll and Hyde?

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:18.967
Mm-hmm.

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:20.301
You've seen one before?

00:04:20.385 --> 00:04:21.678
Oh yeah.

00:04:21.761 --> 00:04:26.057
In '83, during my vacay at the Zurich
Institute for the Criminally Insane.

00:04:26.599 --> 00:04:27.767
Where I got my first lobotomy.

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:31.271
But you know lobotomies.
They're like tattoos. Can't just get one.

00:04:31.354 --> 00:04:32.897
Tell me about the Hyde.

00:04:34.065 --> 00:04:36.359
Ah. Olga Malacova.

00:04:36.943 --> 00:04:39.362
Jeez. She had it all.

00:04:39.445 --> 00:04:43.408
Beauty, brains,
and a penchant for necrophilia.

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:47.120
Olga was a concert pianist,

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:51.124
until one night she transformed
in the middle of a Chopin sonata.

00:04:51.708 --> 00:04:53.668
Massacred a dozen audience members.

00:04:53.751 --> 00:04:55.378
And three music critics.

00:04:55.461 --> 00:04:58.423
What triggered her?
Or did she just change on her own?

00:04:59.007 --> 00:05:00.049
No idea.

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:02.969
I only saw her
in group electroshock therapy.

00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:06.431
There's never been any mention
of Hydes in any outcast book.

00:05:06.514 --> 00:05:09.267
And Nevermore is reputed
for having the best collection.

00:05:10.268 --> 00:05:12.353
You try Nathaniel Faulkner's diary?

00:05:14.522 --> 00:05:15.523
Mmm!

00:05:16.774 --> 00:05:18.234
Before he founded Nevermore,

00:05:18.318 --> 00:05:22.280
Faulkner traveled the world,
cataloging every outcast community.

00:05:22.947 --> 00:05:24.324
How do you know this?

00:05:24.407 --> 00:05:28.036
You think your parents can't keep
their hands off each other now, oy vey.

00:05:28.953 --> 00:05:32.248
I showed up unannounced one night
in Gomez's dorm room.

00:05:32.332 --> 00:05:35.084
Let's just say
I wasn't interrupting a pillow fight.

00:05:35.168 --> 00:05:36.794
-Uncle Fester.

00:05:36.878 --> 00:05:39.255
-Yeah.
-The diary, where is it?

00:05:39.339 --> 00:05:41.215
Nightshades Library.

00:05:41.299 --> 00:05:44.677
Your dad parked me there and said
I should settle in for a long stretch.

00:05:44.761 --> 00:05:47.513
And that's when I found
this nifty little safe.

00:05:48.431 --> 00:05:53.561
I was hoping for a stash of cash or jewels
but instead I found a diary.

00:05:55.146 --> 00:05:57.732
We'll sneak into
the Nightshades Library tonight.

00:05:57.815 --> 00:05:59.150
In the meantime, lay low.

00:06:05.198 --> 00:06:06.407
If you are discovered,

00:06:06.908 --> 00:06:09.994
I will disown you and collect
the reward tied to your capture.

00:06:10.912 --> 00:06:12.455
I'd expect nothing less.

00:06:18.878 --> 00:06:20.838
-Leave the bees alone.

00:06:29.222 --> 00:06:31.891
<i>My novel started out</i>
<i>as a twisted fiction,</i>

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:36.145
<i>but somehow reality has turned it</i>
<i>into my own personal looking glass.</i>

00:06:36.979 --> 00:06:40.191
<i>My visit to the Gates mansion</i>
<i>has left me with so many questions.</i>

00:06:41.275 --> 00:06:44.737
<i>If Laurel Gates died 20 years ago,</i>
<i>then who's sleeping in her bedroom?</i>

00:06:44.821 --> 00:06:46.531
<i>Why do they have photos of me?</i>

00:06:47.031 --> 00:06:49.158
<i>And what is their connection to this Hyde?</i>

00:06:50.201 --> 00:06:53.538
<i>Whoever it is, they're clearly willing</i>
<i>to kill for their secret.</i>

00:06:57.166 --> 00:07:00.461
<i>Goody predicted this quest for answers</i>
<i>would become a lonely pursuit.</i>

00:07:01.963 --> 00:07:04.340
<i>Of course, Goody's nowhere</i>
<i>to be found when I need her.</i>

00:07:06.384 --> 00:07:09.470
<i>The dead can be just as annoying</i>
<i>and unreliable as the living.</i>

00:07:12.306 --> 00:07:13.141
Hi.

00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:16.894
Sorry, I figured you were
still at Mayor Walker's wake.

00:07:16.978 --> 00:07:19.313
As soon as the dirt
hits the coffin, I'm out.

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:23.901
I can't seem to find
my bottle of silver moon nail polish.

00:07:23.985 --> 00:07:26.195
-Do you mind if I look around?

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:29.615
Yoko's hosting
a mani-pedi party for her crew.

00:07:29.699 --> 00:07:32.785
This is the third time
in 24 hours you've forgotten something.

00:07:33.786 --> 00:07:34.787
So,

00:07:35.913 --> 00:07:37.290
how is everything going?

00:07:37.373 --> 00:07:38.958
Solitude suits me.

00:07:39.041 --> 00:07:41.878
With no annoying distractions,
I'm almost finished with my novel.

00:07:42.545 --> 00:07:44.338
Was I an annoying distraction?

00:07:44.422 --> 00:07:47.258
-You definitely had some annoying habits.
-Such as?

00:07:47.341 --> 00:07:50.428
You giggle when you text,
which is a 24/7 addiction.

00:07:50.511 --> 00:07:54.182
At least it's not a migraine-inducing
typewriter hammering into my head.

00:07:54.265 --> 00:07:56.476
When not grinding your canines,
you growl in your sleep.

00:07:56.559 --> 00:07:58.769
As opposed to late night cello solos?

00:07:58.853 --> 00:08:01.772
You over-commit to activities,
then complain about them.

00:08:01.856 --> 00:08:04.275
I'd take that over your obsession
with all things creepy.

00:08:04.358 --> 00:08:07.236
You could gas an entire village
with the amount of perfume you spritz.

00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:09.071
That's just off the top of my head.

00:08:10.615 --> 00:08:13.326
Guess I'm lucky with the new bestie
that doesn't try to find ways

00:08:13.409 --> 00:08:16.954
to endanger literally everybody
she comes into contact with.

00:08:17.038 --> 00:08:21.334
In fact, Yoko and I are so in sync that
she's begging me to be her new roomie.

00:08:21.417 --> 00:08:22.418
Permanently.

00:08:24.045 --> 00:08:27.173
-Don't let me hold you back.
-Enjoy your solitude, Wednesday.

00:08:27.256 --> 00:08:29.550
It's not solitude if you're still here.

00:09:03.042 --> 00:09:03.960
Uncle Fester?

00:09:07.338 --> 00:09:08.756
Who's Uncle Fester?

00:09:10.049 --> 00:09:11.551
What are you doing here?

00:09:11.634 --> 00:09:14.387
Since I'm an actual Nightshade,
I don't have to explain myself.

00:09:14.470 --> 00:09:17.181
What's your excuse for creeping around
in the middle of the night?

00:09:17.682 --> 00:09:18.683
Research.

00:09:19.183 --> 00:09:20.184
On the monster?

00:09:21.519 --> 00:09:22.520
I'll save you some time.

00:09:23.104 --> 00:09:25.064
There's nothing in here
matching that thing.

00:09:26.190 --> 00:09:27.692
Isn't that convenient?

00:09:27.775 --> 00:09:29.277
You know what your problem is?

00:09:31.028 --> 00:09:33.155
I would love to hear
your piercing insight.

00:09:36.534 --> 00:09:38.411
You don't know who your real friends are.

00:09:39.370 --> 00:09:41.789
I've been on your side since day one.

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:44.417
I literally saved your life.

00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:46.961
I believed your theories
when nobody else did.

00:09:47.044 --> 00:09:49.797
And what do I get in return?
Just nothing but suspicion and lies.

00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:52.341
Fine. You want honesty? Here it is.

00:09:52.967 --> 00:09:55.344
Every time the monster's attacked,
you've been right there.

00:09:55.928 --> 00:09:57.680
Starting with Rowan
at the Harvest Festival.

00:10:03.311 --> 00:10:04.395
Then on Outreach Day,

00:10:04.478 --> 00:10:07.315
you arrived just minutes
after the monster disappeared,

00:10:07.398 --> 00:10:08.941
yet you say you didn't see it.

00:10:11.777 --> 00:10:13.613
I didn't realize proximity was a crime.

00:10:13.696 --> 00:10:15.406
Then there's your drawing obsession.

00:10:16.032 --> 00:10:18.451
You have drawn the monster
dozens of times,

00:10:18.534 --> 00:10:20.786
yet you've never seen it. Or so you claim.

00:10:21.621 --> 00:10:24.290
You even drew where it lived.
Then when Eugene went to investigate,

00:10:25.625 --> 00:10:28.127
<i>you tried to kill him</i>
<i>so he wouldn't spill your secret.</i>

00:10:28.794 --> 00:10:30.546
You think I would hurt Eugene?

00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:32.715
Let's not forget
your oh-so-convenient appearance

00:10:32.798 --> 00:10:35.217
after Tyler had been attacked
at the Gates mansion.

00:10:38.095 --> 00:10:39.513
If I am the monster,

00:10:40.681 --> 00:10:42.183
then why haven't I killed you?

00:10:46.270 --> 00:10:49.732
Because for some reason I cannot fathom
or indulge, you seem to like me.

00:10:52.234 --> 00:10:53.361
What's to like?

00:11:06.749 --> 00:11:07.958
How long have you been lurking?

00:11:08.042 --> 00:11:11.587
Long enough to feel
the tension between you two.

00:11:11.671 --> 00:11:12.880
Yowza!

00:11:12.963 --> 00:11:15.800
Seriously, you could cut it
with an executioner's axe.

00:11:17.635 --> 00:11:21.889
I'd recognize the patter
of those fingertips anywhere.

00:11:22.598 --> 00:11:23.432
Hello, Thing.

00:11:25.601 --> 00:11:27.728
You can't still be mad
about the Kalamazoo job.

00:11:27.812 --> 00:11:28.854
It wasn't my fault.

00:11:29.897 --> 00:11:32.316
You said you could crack that safe
in 30 seconds.

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:34.610
Five minutes later, we were still there.

00:11:34.694 --> 00:11:35.820
You're all thumbs.

00:11:35.903 --> 00:11:36.904
Enough.

00:11:41.742 --> 00:11:42.576
Let him go.

00:11:45.162 --> 00:11:46.539
Show me the diary.

00:11:53.087 --> 00:11:54.213
Here we are.

00:11:55.297 --> 00:11:57.800
Iggy was Faulkner's right hand.

00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:00.594
Trained a generation of Nightshades.

00:12:00.678 --> 00:12:02.680
And behind Iggy Itt…

00:12:07.017 --> 00:12:10.020
Do I have time for a snooze,
or can you crack this quickly?

00:12:30.499 --> 00:12:33.794
This is turning into
a replay of Kalamazoo.

00:12:56.233 --> 00:12:58.152
These are some sweet digs.

00:12:59.195 --> 00:13:01.238
How'd you swing your own single?

00:13:01.322 --> 00:13:04.116
My former roommate
couldn't handle my toxic personality.

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:05.201
Mmm.

00:13:07.787 --> 00:13:08.746
Here it is.

00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:13.083
Faulkner describes Hydes
as artists by nature,

00:13:13.167 --> 00:13:15.085
but equally vindictive in temperament.

00:13:15.586 --> 00:13:19.215
Born of mutation, the Hyde lays dormant
until unleashed by a traumatic event

00:13:19.298 --> 00:13:22.009
or unlocked through
chemical inducement or hypnosis.

00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:25.596
This causes the Hyde to develop
an immediate bond with its liberator,

00:13:25.679 --> 00:13:27.681
who the creature now sees as its master.

00:13:28.891 --> 00:13:31.268
It becomes the willing instrument
of whatever nefarious agenda

00:13:31.352 --> 00:13:32.853
this new master might propose.

00:13:33.813 --> 00:13:37.233
Anyone willing
to unlock a Hyde is a next-level sicko.

00:13:38.776 --> 00:13:41.237
That means I'm not looking
for one killer but two.

00:13:42.404 --> 00:13:44.031
The monster and its master.

00:13:51.622 --> 00:13:53.374
I didn't mean to startle you.

00:13:56.669 --> 00:13:58.128
I was just working on my novel.

00:13:59.839 --> 00:14:03.843
Enid has requested to room with Yoko
for the rest of the school year.

00:14:05.511 --> 00:14:06.345
She did?

00:14:06.428 --> 00:14:07.847
When there's a falling out,

00:14:07.930 --> 00:14:10.808
I like to get both girls' perspectives
on what happened.

00:14:11.809 --> 00:14:14.019
You two seemed as thick as thieves.

00:14:14.103 --> 00:14:17.648
Ultimately, thieves turn on each other.
I've seen it with my own eyes.

00:14:18.232 --> 00:14:21.902
Deflect all you want, but you and I
both know that you care about Enid.

00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:26.240
And you have to admit she managed
to bring out a spark of warmth in you.

00:14:26.907 --> 00:14:29.076
Oh, don't worry. Just a tiny spark.

00:14:29.743 --> 00:14:31.412
Barely perceptible to the average eye,

00:14:31.495 --> 00:14:33.205
but… I noticed.

00:14:35.291 --> 00:14:36.792
Part of the dorm experience is

00:14:36.876 --> 00:14:40.129
making friends with people
that you wouldn't normally connect with.

00:14:40.629 --> 00:14:44.341
And those friendships
often turn into lifelong bonds.

00:14:44.425 --> 00:14:45.759
I would rather buy a rope.

00:14:46.510 --> 00:14:49.263
Is it really so difficult for you
to admit that you made a friend,

00:14:49.346 --> 00:14:51.932
and now that she's gone
you might actually miss her?

00:14:54.018 --> 00:14:55.144
I'll survive alone.

00:14:55.686 --> 00:14:56.604
I always have.

00:14:58.772 --> 00:15:02.276
Well, if that's your decision,
I'll submit the forms to Principal Weems.

00:15:15.205 --> 00:15:16.123
Uncle Fester?

00:15:31.013 --> 00:15:32.014
Uncle Fester?

00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:38.228
Hey! Being a solo lobo has its perks.

00:15:38.312 --> 00:15:41.398
You get to live by your own rules,
do whatever you want.

00:15:41.482 --> 00:15:44.026
Just look at me.

00:15:49.531 --> 00:15:51.992
Hi. Um, I need to talk to you.

00:15:52.868 --> 00:15:54.411
No, like… like, right now.

00:15:55.579 --> 00:15:56.997
Yeah, I know where that is.

00:15:58.207 --> 00:16:00.626
Okay, I can meet you there
in, like, 20 minutes.

00:16:01.293 --> 00:16:02.294
Okay. Bye.

00:16:02.378 --> 00:16:03.504
Who're you talking to?

00:16:04.713 --> 00:16:07.675
-It's none of your goddamn business.
-I know what you are, Xavier.

00:16:07.758 --> 00:16:09.760
Can you stay the hell away from me?

00:16:21.063 --> 00:16:22.606
Did you place the tracker?

00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:26.944
Don't worry.
Uncle Fester's got you covered.

00:16:29.613 --> 00:16:32.366
Okay. Let's hit the road.

00:16:36.578 --> 00:16:37.579
What?

00:16:37.663 --> 00:16:39.665
I picked it up on my way out of town.

00:16:40.165 --> 00:16:42.918
You know me. I like to travel incognito.

00:16:51.844 --> 00:16:52.886
Come on, let's roll!

00:17:28.130 --> 00:17:30.007
Hey! What's so urgent?

00:17:30.507 --> 00:17:31.717
What happened?

00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:34.845
I had a dream where you died.

00:17:34.928 --> 00:17:36.472
Get in the car.

00:17:49.735 --> 00:17:53.155
Principal Weems, it is imperative
I speak with you about Dr. Kinbott.

00:17:53.238 --> 00:17:55.699
Wednesday. We were just talking about you.

00:17:55.783 --> 00:17:57.284
Speak of the devil.

00:17:58.911 --> 00:18:00.245
And she shall appear.

00:18:00.329 --> 00:18:02.206
Dr. Kinbott was just
discussing your assessment.

00:18:02.289 --> 00:18:05.375
I need to sign off on it
before she hands it in to the court.

00:18:05.876 --> 00:18:08.420
Well, what's the verdict, Doctor?
Am I cured?

00:18:09.671 --> 00:18:13.175
I'm glad you find it amusing.
The judge assigned to your case won't.

00:18:13.258 --> 00:18:15.177
I've explained to Dr. Kinbott

00:18:15.260 --> 00:18:18.180
that you've recently been taking
small but meaningful steps

00:18:18.263 --> 00:18:20.641
towards embracing
your new Nevermore family.

00:18:21.850 --> 00:18:22.684
Yes.

00:18:23.727 --> 00:18:26.146
I think I've actually reached
the half-hug stage.

00:18:26.897 --> 00:18:29.066
I've been reading about hypnotherapy.

00:18:29.149 --> 00:18:31.860
It might be a good technique
to unlock my inner Wednesday.

00:18:32.361 --> 00:18:33.403
Are you a devotee?

00:18:34.363 --> 00:18:35.823
Yes, very much so.

00:18:36.740 --> 00:18:39.576
I applaud your new willingness
to delve deep into yourself.

00:18:39.660 --> 00:18:41.120
I'm seeing you on Monday.

00:18:41.203 --> 00:18:42.287
We can start then.

00:18:43.288 --> 00:18:45.874
What did you so urgently
need to discuss, Wednesday?

00:18:47.876 --> 00:18:48.710
It can wait.

00:18:49.545 --> 00:18:50.796
Now if you'll excuse me,

00:18:51.380 --> 00:18:53.215
I have some homework to finish.

00:19:02.766 --> 00:19:04.726
Kinbott has to be Xavier's master.

00:19:04.810 --> 00:19:05.644
Hmm.

00:19:05.727 --> 00:19:08.063
The Hyde lays dormant
until unleashed by a traumatic event

00:19:08.147 --> 00:19:10.774
or unlocked through
chemical inducement or hypnosis.

00:19:11.275 --> 00:19:12.276
Mmm!

00:19:15.988 --> 00:19:17.156
Are you listening?

00:19:18.073 --> 00:19:21.201
She must've figured out he's a Hyde
and used hypnotherapy to unlock him.

00:19:21.285 --> 00:19:23.328
That would explain their secret sessions.

00:19:23.829 --> 00:19:26.707
I think the kid behind the counter
has clocked me.

00:19:27.958 --> 00:19:30.127
Yeah. He's walking over.

00:19:30.210 --> 00:19:32.212
I'm gonna put him
in a Romanian sleeper hold.

00:19:32.296 --> 00:19:33.338
-Cover me.
-Relax.

00:19:33.422 --> 00:19:34.882
He's not interested in you.

00:19:36.300 --> 00:19:38.719
Uh, made you a quad. On the house.

00:19:39.219 --> 00:19:42.097
Hey, thanks kid.

00:19:42.181 --> 00:19:44.057
Need a refill on this puppy too.

00:19:45.475 --> 00:19:46.643
-Uh--
-Tyler.

00:19:46.727 --> 00:19:47.936
This is my Uncle Fester.

00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:50.189
Oh. Uh…

00:19:50.272 --> 00:19:51.815
-Hi, it's nice to--

00:19:59.489 --> 00:20:00.324
Is that…?

00:20:04.328 --> 00:20:05.329
It's called a Hyde.

00:20:08.123 --> 00:20:10.417
Whoa, that's it. From that night.

00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:15.380
Your father gave you
explicit instructions not to be near me.

00:20:16.506 --> 00:20:18.467
Yeah, my dad's not here,
and I'm on a break.

00:20:20.093 --> 00:20:23.472
Well, apparently a Hyde needs to be
unlocked by someone. Its master.

00:20:23.555 --> 00:20:24.765
Holy shit.

00:20:26.642 --> 00:20:27.476
Tyler.

00:20:28.769 --> 00:20:30.020
What'd I say?

00:20:32.147 --> 00:20:33.148
Uh…

00:20:35.817 --> 00:20:38.028
For the record,
Wednesday was trying to keep her distance.

00:20:38.111 --> 00:20:40.072
I was the one that sat down with her.

00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:44.034
All right.

00:20:44.826 --> 00:20:46.161
Putting these up around town.

00:20:46.245 --> 00:20:49.164
It's a bank robbery suspect,
and he's a real creep.

00:20:49.248 --> 00:20:51.124
-You haven't seen him, have you?
-No.

00:20:51.959 --> 00:20:53.877
Yeah, he'd be pretty hard to miss.

00:20:54.461 --> 00:20:56.463
I'll pin it on the bulletin board.

00:21:01.635 --> 00:21:04.388
Ah, why waste my breath?

00:21:08.809 --> 00:21:10.936
Thank you. But you didn't have to do that.

00:21:11.019 --> 00:21:14.398
Yeah, your family's very… colorful.

00:21:14.982 --> 00:21:17.025
Ironic considering Fester's
the black sheep.

00:21:17.609 --> 00:21:18.735
He's harmless.

00:21:19.361 --> 00:21:21.822
So, about rescheduling our date…

00:21:24.074 --> 00:21:25.617
Between the monster and my uncle--

00:21:25.701 --> 00:21:26.535
Hey, no excuses.

00:21:26.618 --> 00:21:29.079
Figure after what happened
last time, you owe me.

00:21:30.872 --> 00:21:33.208
I can't sneak off of campus.
All eyes are on me.

00:21:34.001 --> 00:21:35.377
You won't have to.

00:21:35.460 --> 00:21:37.045
I'll come to you.

00:21:37.129 --> 00:21:38.964
9:00 p.m., Crackstone's Crypt.

00:22:05.324 --> 00:22:06.366
I don't miss her.

00:22:07.117 --> 00:22:09.578
Friends are a liability
and can be exploited.

00:22:09.661 --> 00:22:11.204
That makes them weaknesses.

00:22:11.288 --> 00:22:13.623
Your job is to guard
that diary while I'm gone.

00:22:14.499 --> 00:22:16.168
I'll be back as soon as I can.

00:22:18.378 --> 00:22:19.338
It's not a date.

00:22:20.630 --> 00:22:23.467
It's a quid pro quo
for almost getting him disemboweled.

00:22:23.967 --> 00:22:25.218
Watch that diary!

00:22:34.144 --> 00:22:37.272
Last time somebody threw a surprise
for me here, it did not go as planned.

00:22:38.357 --> 00:22:40.984
I guarantee this one
won't make you pass out cold.

00:22:41.943 --> 00:22:44.071
But you do have to close your eyes.

00:22:45.030 --> 00:22:46.073
Are you serious?

00:22:46.740 --> 00:22:47.657
Unfortunately.

00:22:51.078 --> 00:22:52.996
I'm only doing this because I owe you.

00:22:53.497 --> 00:22:55.040
Okay. Watch your step.

00:22:56.583 --> 00:22:58.251
Wait here. Close your eyes.

00:23:01.380 --> 00:23:02.255
Okay.

00:23:05.675 --> 00:23:07.469
Easy. Right here.

00:23:08.512 --> 00:23:09.638
One second.

00:23:15.936 --> 00:23:18.188
Okay, you can open your eyes now.

00:23:38.125 --> 00:23:41.920
What? No one's ever taken you
on a picnic inside a crypt before?

00:23:51.138 --> 00:23:53.140
How do you feel about scary movies?

00:23:57.018 --> 00:23:58.687
Prepare to be horrified.

00:24:28.925 --> 00:24:31.303
That is definitely our suspect's bike.

00:24:31.386 --> 00:24:33.138
Looks as weird as he does.

00:24:34.514 --> 00:24:38.226
All right, he couldn't have got too far
on foot. So, you guys spread out.

00:24:38.727 --> 00:24:40.562
I'm going to check down by the lake.

00:24:48.236 --> 00:24:49.738
That was torture.

00:24:51.031 --> 00:24:51.865
Thank you.

00:24:55.785 --> 00:24:59.080
Okay, don't hate me.
I'm just gonna come out and say it.

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:03.793
I want us to be more than friends.

00:25:06.171 --> 00:25:07.297
You'll snap out of it.

00:25:07.964 --> 00:25:08.882
Don't do that.

00:25:08.965 --> 00:25:10.383
Discount my feelings.

00:25:11.176 --> 00:25:14.221
I'm not friend material,
let alone more-than-friend material.

00:25:15.639 --> 00:25:17.682
I will ignore you, stomp on your heart,

00:25:17.766 --> 00:25:19.935
and always put my needs
and interests first.

00:25:22.312 --> 00:25:24.481
Yeah, you can keep trying to push me away.

00:25:24.564 --> 00:25:25.774
It's not going to work.

00:25:25.857 --> 00:25:27.234
I almost killed you.

00:25:27.317 --> 00:25:28.360
I survived.

00:25:28.443 --> 00:25:30.487
-Beginner's luck.
-I'm tougher than you think.

00:25:36.409 --> 00:25:37.953
You're making a mistake.

00:25:39.287 --> 00:25:40.121
Probably.

00:25:41.623 --> 00:25:42.457
Definitely.

00:25:52.217 --> 00:25:53.301
What the hell?

00:25:53.885 --> 00:25:55.011
Tyler.

00:25:55.095 --> 00:25:57.305
Dad? What are you doing here?

00:25:58.974 --> 00:26:01.184
The school groundskeeper
found a motorbike by the lake.

00:26:01.268 --> 00:26:04.062
It matches the description
of the one the bank robber stole.

00:26:04.145 --> 00:26:07.524
There's a canoe missing.
Figured he might be on Raven Island.

00:26:08.942 --> 00:26:12.654
I'm not going to ask what this is,
but I never saw the two of you here.

00:26:13.238 --> 00:26:14.239
You got it?

00:26:15.407 --> 00:26:17.450
Unbelievable. Come on.

00:26:29.754 --> 00:26:30.755
The diary…

00:26:34.009 --> 00:26:34.843
Thing?

00:26:44.769 --> 00:26:45.687
Thing…

00:26:57.991 --> 00:26:59.826
Fester? Fester, help!

00:26:59.909 --> 00:27:01.745
Help! Help! Thing's not moving.

00:27:01.828 --> 00:27:04.122
-He was stabbed!
-Get him on the table!

00:27:24.643 --> 00:27:25.602
Oh, come on, Thing.

00:27:48.291 --> 00:27:49.834
He's gone, Wednesday.

00:27:50.585 --> 00:27:51.920
No, he's not. Thing.

00:27:52.921 --> 00:27:54.172
If you can hear me…

00:27:56.341 --> 00:27:58.593
if you die, I will kill you.

00:28:00.428 --> 00:28:01.554
Go again.

00:28:02.055 --> 00:28:03.515
Now! Again, please!

00:28:27.872 --> 00:28:30.792
For a minute, we thought
you'd picked your last lock, buddy.

00:28:32.919 --> 00:28:34.421
Who did this to you?

00:28:37.549 --> 00:28:39.926
Knife from behind the back. Cowards.

00:28:40.844 --> 00:28:43.346
I promise that whoever did this to you
will suffer.

00:28:43.847 --> 00:28:45.140
And it will be slow,

00:28:45.974 --> 00:28:46.850
long,

00:28:47.892 --> 00:28:49.769
and excruciatingly painful.

00:29:06.244 --> 00:29:07.746
I'll stitch him back up.

00:29:09.873 --> 00:29:11.166
They found your motorbike, so…

00:29:12.459 --> 00:29:14.085
the sheriff won't be far. You need to go.

00:29:15.003 --> 00:29:17.297
Maybe next time
steal something a little less conspicuous.

00:29:18.089 --> 00:29:19.340
Where's the fun in that?

00:29:21.551 --> 00:29:24.220
All right. I'll lay low here tonight,

00:29:24.304 --> 00:29:27.682
keep an eye on the patient,
and I'll skedaddle in the morning.

00:29:30.018 --> 00:29:33.062
I guess I'll see you at your arraignment
or the next family reunion.

00:29:33.646 --> 00:29:35.482
You'll always be my favorite, Wednesday.

00:29:36.608 --> 00:29:38.193
Be sure to tell Pugsley that.

00:29:39.068 --> 00:29:40.403
It'll give him a complex.

00:29:47.452 --> 00:29:50.288
I'm guessing it's not
some kind of random prank.

00:29:50.371 --> 00:29:53.958
Whoever ransacked my room
also stole Nathaniel Faulkner's diary.

00:29:54.042 --> 00:29:57.170
That's supposed to be safely locked
in the Nightshades Library.

00:29:57.253 --> 00:29:58.797
So you do know about that diary,

00:29:58.880 --> 00:30:01.966
which means you also know
the monster we're after is called a Hyde.

00:30:06.471 --> 00:30:09.307
Thank you, Ms. Thornhill.
I'll take it from here.

00:30:09.891 --> 00:30:13.228
Of course. If you need anything,
I'll be right down the hall.

00:30:33.164 --> 00:30:36.042
Faulkner spent years studying Hydes.

00:30:37.710 --> 00:30:40.296
He wanted to determine
if they were just mindless killers

00:30:40.380 --> 00:30:42.465
or conscious of their actions.

00:30:42.549 --> 00:30:44.175
What was his conclusion?

00:30:44.926 --> 00:30:47.637
He was killed by a Hyde
before he could reach one.

00:30:48.513 --> 00:30:50.265
Others tried to carry on his research,

00:30:50.348 --> 00:30:53.059
but the Hydes were
too unpredictable and violent.

00:30:54.185 --> 00:30:57.146
They were officially banned
from Nevermore 30 years ago.

00:30:59.566 --> 00:31:02.235
All of this time,
you've known the monster was a Hyde.

00:31:03.403 --> 00:31:04.737
Why didn't you tell the sheriff?

00:31:05.822 --> 00:31:07.949
Because then Nevermore is done.

00:31:08.032 --> 00:31:09.450
Over. Shut for good.

00:31:09.534 --> 00:31:11.703
And that's not happening on my watch.

00:31:12.412 --> 00:31:14.414
But I'm not the only one withholding.

00:31:15.123 --> 00:31:17.250
If you suspect someone,
you need to tell me.

00:31:17.333 --> 00:31:18.209
Why?

00:31:19.335 --> 00:31:21.796
All you've ever done
is gaslight and obstruct me.

00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:25.466
You don't care how many people die,
as long as your reputation is safe.

00:31:27.802 --> 00:31:33.850
I am protecting our Nevermore family,
which also includes you, Ms. Addams.

00:31:53.119 --> 00:31:54.078
Come with me.

00:31:54.162 --> 00:31:56.873
I have information
about Mayor Walker's murder.

00:32:06.925 --> 00:32:08.760
Printed these off my dad's computer.

00:32:08.843 --> 00:32:11.137
Seems he was trying to track down someone.

00:32:11.220 --> 00:32:14.432
Laurel Gates? Looks like
he started right after Outreach Day.

00:32:14.515 --> 00:32:16.017
Must have recognized her there.

00:32:16.100 --> 00:32:18.686
According to British police,
Laurel was presumed drowned,

00:32:18.770 --> 00:32:20.355
but no body was ever recovered.

00:32:21.564 --> 00:32:24.943
The Gates mansion was purchased
a year ago by a 90-year-old candy heiress.

00:32:25.026 --> 00:32:28.738
She then mysteriously died and gave
all of her belongings to her caregiver,

00:32:29.405 --> 00:32:30.740
Teresa L. Glau.

00:32:32.992 --> 00:32:34.369
It's an anagram for Laurel Gates.

00:32:35.453 --> 00:32:37.330
Laurel secretly buys her old house

00:32:37.413 --> 00:32:39.791
and then comes back
to Jericho as someone else.

00:32:40.583 --> 00:32:41.417
Why?

00:32:43.670 --> 00:32:47.131
Revenge on all the people she blames
for her family's misfortunes. Your father.

00:32:48.091 --> 00:32:48.925
The coroner.

00:32:49.008 --> 00:32:50.093
My parents.

00:32:50.760 --> 00:32:52.053
Most of all, Nevermore.

00:32:52.845 --> 00:32:54.555
How does the monster fit into all of this?

00:32:55.139 --> 00:32:57.850
The monster is a Hyde.
It's doing Laurel's bidding.

00:32:57.934 --> 00:32:58.935
She controls it.

00:32:59.686 --> 00:33:02.438
You know who Laurel is, don't you?

00:33:07.860 --> 00:33:10.655
Wednesday, we don't have
an appointment scheduled today.

00:33:11.364 --> 00:33:12.824
I wanted to return something.

00:33:12.907 --> 00:33:13.908
Uh…

00:33:15.243 --> 00:33:17.328
I found it in your old childhood room.

00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:27.964
I know you're Laurel Gates, and you've
come back to Jericho to seek your revenge.

00:33:29.507 --> 00:33:31.926
And so did Mayor Walker,
which is why you had to kill him.

00:33:32.427 --> 00:33:34.887
Who better to slide in and out
of the hospital undetected

00:33:34.971 --> 00:33:37.432
than a psychiatrist under the guise
of visiting another patient?

00:33:39.767 --> 00:33:42.562
You're not actually accusing me
of murdering the mayor?

00:33:42.645 --> 00:33:45.356
The roses you left
in Eugene's room were your mistake.

00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:48.484
They're the same variety
I found near your childhood bed.

00:33:48.568 --> 00:33:51.029
I honestly have no idea
what you're talking about.

00:33:51.112 --> 00:33:54.198
There's only one reason an overqualified
psychiatrist like yourself

00:33:54.282 --> 00:33:57.326
would settle in the inconsequential
backwater that is Jericho.

00:33:57.410 --> 00:34:00.538
It allowed you to crawl through
the troubled, young minds of outcasts

00:34:00.621 --> 00:34:03.916
until you found one that you can
manipulate to exact your revenge.

00:34:06.294 --> 00:34:07.295
You know what?

00:34:07.378 --> 00:34:10.339
I don't have time
to deal with your delusional fantasies.

00:34:10.423 --> 00:34:11.799
I have a patient emergency.

00:34:11.883 --> 00:34:13.593
Who? Xavier?

00:34:14.177 --> 00:34:16.929
I know all about the secret sessions
you've been holding in your car.

00:34:17.472 --> 00:34:20.516
I also found the cave where you've been
holding sessions to unlock his Hyde.

00:34:21.976 --> 00:34:23.853
You are so out of line.

00:34:23.936 --> 00:34:26.355
Do you know
how violently unpredictable a Hyde can be?

00:34:26.439 --> 00:34:29.275
It was your plan to have Xavier committed
before he could turn on you too.

00:34:29.358 --> 00:34:32.153
Wednesday, you need help.

00:34:32.236 --> 00:34:33.863
More help than I can give you.

00:34:33.946 --> 00:34:35.323
Who you calling? Xavier?

00:34:36.115 --> 00:34:37.325
Judge Reynolds.

00:34:37.408 --> 00:34:41.037
I'm going to recommend you stay
in a juvenile psychiatric facility.

00:34:41.120 --> 00:34:44.540
Oh, please. You and I both know
I'd be running that place in a week.

00:34:48.336 --> 00:34:49.462
Time's up, Laurel.

00:35:01.432 --> 00:35:03.476
Principal Weems, it's Valerie Kinbott.

00:35:03.559 --> 00:35:05.561
Wednesday Addams
just barged into my office.

00:35:06.354 --> 00:35:08.356
I wasn't aware
that Wednesday had a session today.

00:35:08.439 --> 00:35:11.400
She didn't, and her behavior
was completely irrational.

00:35:12.985 --> 00:35:15.113
-<i>Dr. Kinbott?</i>

00:35:19.575 --> 00:35:20.618
<i>Dr. Kinbott?</i>

00:35:55.361 --> 00:35:56.237
She's gone.

00:35:56.821 --> 00:35:58.364
Dr. Kinbott's dead.

00:36:01.325 --> 00:36:02.535
This ends now.

00:36:23.723 --> 00:36:26.100
You know what?
You need to stay out of my space.

00:36:26.184 --> 00:36:27.977
You need to take your own advice.

00:36:30.229 --> 00:36:31.480
You left that in my room.

00:36:32.315 --> 00:36:33.900
Actually, you left it in Thing.

00:36:34.984 --> 00:36:36.986
How long have you been seeing Kinbott?

00:36:37.486 --> 00:36:38.321
Have you…?

00:36:40.948 --> 00:36:44.911
What am I saying? Of course you have.
You've been spying on me, right?

00:36:49.207 --> 00:36:52.084
'Cause I'm the villain in your fantasy.

00:36:54.170 --> 00:36:59.217
My father thinks that my mental health
is a PR problem that he needs to manage.

00:37:00.968 --> 00:37:03.679
He wanted to keep
his troubled son out of the tabloids.

00:37:06.098 --> 00:37:07.225
I wasn't in your room.

00:37:08.643 --> 00:37:10.686
Believe me or don't believe me,

00:37:10.770 --> 00:37:11.979
I don't care.

00:37:20.321 --> 00:37:22.031
Your painting's been improving.

00:37:22.531 --> 00:37:24.116
I enjoy this one in particular.

00:37:28.537 --> 00:37:30.206
Feels like you really lived it.

00:37:32.708 --> 00:37:35.211
-What do you want?
-I'm asking the questions.

00:37:40.549 --> 00:37:42.969
What is Rowan's inhaler
doing in your shed?

00:37:47.265 --> 00:37:48.599
Or Eugene's glasses?

00:37:50.226 --> 00:37:51.435
Whoa, whoa.

00:37:51.519 --> 00:37:53.896
Or these stalker images you took of me?

00:37:53.980 --> 00:37:56.232
-No. I--
-Don't forget your latest addition.

00:37:59.402 --> 00:38:00.778
Kinbott's necklace.

00:38:01.279 --> 00:38:03.239
-Somebody planted that stuff!
-Freeze!

00:38:03.823 --> 00:38:06.367
Drop the knife. Down on your knees.

00:38:07.618 --> 00:38:08.452
Cuff him.

00:38:08.536 --> 00:38:10.454
-You have the right to remain silent.
-What?

00:38:10.538 --> 00:38:13.040
Anything you say can and will be
used against you in court.

00:38:13.124 --> 00:38:14.875
You have the right to an attorney.

00:38:14.959 --> 00:38:17.461
If you cannot afford an attorney
one will be appointed.

00:38:17.545 --> 00:38:19.088
Appreciate the help, Addams.

00:38:19.797 --> 00:38:21.716
You! You framed me!

00:38:22.508 --> 00:38:23.676
I'm being set up.

00:38:24.593 --> 00:38:25.720
I shoulda let Rowan kill you.

00:38:42.528 --> 00:38:43.404
Hey.

00:38:45.323 --> 00:38:46.157
You're back.

00:38:46.907 --> 00:38:49.327
I'm gone for a few days,
the place gets trashed,

00:38:49.410 --> 00:38:50.661
and Thing almost dies.

00:38:51.495 --> 00:38:53.456
Someone's gotta look out for you two.

00:38:53.539 --> 00:38:54.957
What happened to rooming with Yoko?

00:38:55.541 --> 00:38:59.295
Yoko's great. I just decided
I needed a few more boundaries.

00:39:00.588 --> 00:39:01.881
Skip the tape.

00:39:02.631 --> 00:39:04.759
Don't tell me Wednesday Addams
is mellowing out.

00:39:04.842 --> 00:39:05.718
Never.

00:39:07.845 --> 00:39:09.347
More like evolving.

00:39:09.930 --> 00:39:12.266
Well, one inch of duct tape at a time.

00:39:13.809 --> 00:39:15.144
Why the sudden change of heart?

00:39:16.270 --> 00:39:17.271
Because we work.

00:39:17.980 --> 00:39:19.982
We shouldn't, but we do.

00:39:20.066 --> 00:39:22.443
It's like some sort of weird,
friendship anomaly.

00:39:22.526 --> 00:39:24.820
Everything you said about me is true.

00:39:25.946 --> 00:39:27.656
But I don't apologize for it.

00:39:28.324 --> 00:39:29.283
Not anymore.

00:39:31.118 --> 00:39:32.203
It's just who I am.

00:39:37.750 --> 00:39:38.751
Thing said he missed you.

00:39:40.836 --> 00:39:42.129
I missed him too.

00:39:45.841 --> 00:39:47.468
I'm sorry about Xavier.

00:39:48.135 --> 00:39:50.805
I'm not. He's a liar and a killer.

00:39:51.514 --> 00:39:55.559
Besides… there's nothing quite like
the feeling of being proven right.

00:39:56.143 --> 00:39:58.187
Except maybe someone to share it with.

00:39:59.188 --> 00:40:01.440
Thing may have blabbed
about your date with Tyler.

00:40:01.524 --> 00:40:02.691
So how'd it go?

00:40:03.484 --> 00:40:04.860
It was interrupted.

00:40:08.072 --> 00:40:11.283
Well, I heard
Tyler's working the late shift…

00:40:21.419 --> 00:40:22.503
We're closed.

00:40:23.087 --> 00:40:25.005
Then you should lock your doors.

00:40:27.133 --> 00:40:29.260
There's some real sick people out there.

00:40:32.388 --> 00:40:35.433
Yeah, my dad told me
what happened with Xavier.

00:40:37.643 --> 00:40:39.019
Pretty nuts.

00:40:39.103 --> 00:40:41.063
That guy always seemed so normal.

00:40:42.189 --> 00:40:44.400
You know, for an outcast.

00:40:45.192 --> 00:40:46.193
Well, you know,

00:40:47.736 --> 00:40:49.780
it has made me re-evaluate things.

00:40:52.658 --> 00:40:53.534
Like what?

00:40:55.494 --> 00:40:56.745
Like who I can trust.

00:41:00.207 --> 00:41:02.668
That mean you're ready
to be more than friends?

00:41:43.959 --> 00:41:46.045
-Whoa, hey!

00:42:02.978 --> 00:42:03.854
You okay?

00:42:05.105 --> 00:42:05.981
I need to go.

00:42:07.274 --> 00:42:08.108
What?

00:42:09.652 --> 00:42:10.819
Wh… What's wrong?

00:42:12.154 --> 00:42:13.072
Wednesday!

00:42:18.786 --> 00:42:20.412
<i>Of course the first boy I kiss</i>

00:42:20.496 --> 00:42:23.499
<i>would turn out to be a psychotic,</i>
<i>serial-killing monster.</i>

00:42:25.084 --> 00:42:26.418
<i>I guess I have a type.</i>
