00:00:30.363 --> 00:00:33.074
<i>Dr. Kinbott tells me</i>
<i>I should get out more.</i>

00:00:36.745 --> 00:00:40.540
<i>Says I need to open my mind</i>
<i>to new people and experiences.</i>

00:00:40.623 --> 00:00:43.293
<i>Who am I to argue</i>
<i>with her professional clichés?</i>

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:50.550
While I do the autopsy,

00:00:50.633 --> 00:00:53.720
you find the files of the monster's
other victims and make copies.

00:00:54.554 --> 00:00:56.264
-Don't pout.

00:00:56.347 --> 00:00:57.807
Your scalpel skills are questionable.

00:01:00.351 --> 00:01:03.605
Do you remember my 13th birthday,
when Uncle Fester gave me that cadaver?

00:01:03.688 --> 00:01:05.690
You sliced right through
that man's carotid.

00:01:09.527 --> 00:01:10.528
No.

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:13.114
No.

00:01:13.198 --> 00:01:15.492
Magnificent hematoma.

00:01:21.998 --> 00:01:23.208
There you are.

00:01:28.129 --> 00:01:31.758
Thursday, 7:23 p.m.
The body is that of a 50-year-old male.

00:01:40.725 --> 00:01:43.394
Lacerations and defensive wounds
appear on both hands.

00:01:43.478 --> 00:01:46.439
What remains of the chest
and torso indicates a frenzied attack.

00:01:46.523 --> 00:01:48.650
Subject has been
almost entirely disemboweled.

00:02:00.245 --> 00:02:01.454
This is curious.

00:02:01.996 --> 00:02:03.581
Subject's left foot is missing.

00:02:04.082 --> 00:02:06.459
It appears to have been
chewed off at the ankle.

00:02:12.257 --> 00:02:14.175
Have you seen a left foot anywhere?

00:02:15.468 --> 00:02:17.303
Calm down. Who's coming?

00:02:25.186 --> 00:02:27.272
Appreciate you coming back
to the office, Doc.

00:02:27.355 --> 00:02:28.690
No problem, Sheriff.

00:02:28.773 --> 00:02:30.316
Whatever I can do to help.

00:02:31.234 --> 00:02:33.903
Whatever or whoever
is responsible for these killings…

00:02:33.987 --> 00:02:36.823
In all my years,
I've never seen injuries like them.

00:02:37.824 --> 00:02:39.325
I thought you should see this

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:41.828
before I issued my report
on the latest victim.

00:02:42.745 --> 00:02:44.330
It's a real noodle-scratcher.

00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:50.253
The killer cut off two toes
from the victim's left foot.

00:02:50.336 --> 00:02:52.714
Best guess, they used a surgical saw.

00:02:53.298 --> 00:02:55.383
The final autopsy report's still pending.

00:02:55.466 --> 00:02:58.011
Minute you're done,
send it straight to my desk.

00:02:58.094 --> 00:02:59.554
Media blackout on the toes.

00:03:00.346 --> 00:03:01.347
Sure thing, Sheriff.

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.435
Been a busy couple of weeks, huh?

00:03:05.518 --> 00:03:08.605
At least I'm going out in style.
Friday's my last day.

00:03:09.606 --> 00:03:11.191
Happy retirement, Doc.

00:03:11.274 --> 00:03:13.860
Gonna surprise Mrs. Anwar
with a four-week cruise.

00:03:15.612 --> 00:03:18.698
Excited to trade rib shears for Mai Tais.

00:03:21.868 --> 00:03:23.453
See yourself out. I'll lock up.

00:03:44.557 --> 00:03:46.476
I don't remember this one coming in.

00:03:48.895 --> 00:03:51.147
Full rigor. You've been dead a while.

00:03:51.231 --> 00:03:54.317
Guess you won't mind waiting
another day for me to cut you open.

00:04:09.666 --> 00:04:10.875
Five more minutes.

00:04:11.751 --> 00:04:13.461
I was just getting comfortable.

00:04:35.525 --> 00:04:38.361
When I suggested giving
your side of the room a makeover,

00:04:38.444 --> 00:04:41.155
I did not have
Ted Bundy's Pinterest in mind.

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:44.826
Still not as creepy
as your stuffed unicorn collection.

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:47.078
Is this why you snuck out last night?

00:04:47.161 --> 00:04:49.289
Thing and I made
an unsanctioned trip to the morgue

00:04:49.372 --> 00:04:51.082
to copy the files
of the monster's victims.

00:04:51.916 --> 00:04:55.461
Okay, there are so many levels
of ew in that statement,

00:04:55.545 --> 00:04:58.298
-I don't know where to begin.
-I need to get inside its head.

00:04:58.381 --> 00:05:02.218
Discover any patterns or anomalies.
I've already made a big discovery.

00:05:03.303 --> 00:05:07.390
Turns out all of the monster's victims
have had body parts surgically removed.

00:05:09.058 --> 00:05:10.935
The first one a kidney,
the second a finger--

00:05:11.019 --> 00:05:13.730
-Wednesday, I don't feel--
-Third a gall bladder.

00:05:13.813 --> 00:05:16.607
And the bearded man
from the meeting house, two toes.

00:05:16.691 --> 00:05:19.736
Do you understand what this means?
These murders aren't mindless.

00:05:19.819 --> 00:05:23.781
He's collecting trophies like a seasoned
serial killer. It's impressive, actually.

00:05:29.829 --> 00:05:31.164
Fetch the smelling salts.

00:05:31.831 --> 00:05:32.832
Again.

00:05:36.252 --> 00:05:40.298
While most plants reward
their pollinators with sweet nectar,

00:05:40.381 --> 00:05:44.344
many carnivorous varieties
turn to sexual trickery

00:05:44.427 --> 00:05:45.762
or deception.

00:05:51.059 --> 00:05:52.685
I tweaked my back fencing.

00:05:52.769 --> 00:05:57.106
The orchid produces
a pheromone that mimics a female insect,

00:05:57.690 --> 00:05:59.275
luring the males in.

00:05:59.359 --> 00:06:02.320
Now, once the plant is pollinated,

00:06:02.403 --> 00:06:04.864
what do the male insects get in exchange?

00:06:05.448 --> 00:06:08.076
Nada. Just like
all the guys at the Rave'N.

00:06:09.077 --> 00:06:11.996
Okay, okay. I know you're all
excited about Saturday,

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:14.290
which is why I haven't
assigned any homework.

00:06:14.374 --> 00:06:15.375
-Yes!

00:06:15.458 --> 00:06:18.711
But I do still need volunteers
for the decorating committee.

00:06:18.795 --> 00:06:21.172
Anyone interested,
come and see me up here.

00:06:21.672 --> 00:06:23.174
You're not gonna volunteer?

00:06:23.257 --> 00:06:26.594
Aren't you pumped about disco balls
and spiked punch?

00:06:26.677 --> 00:06:29.138
There's even a DJ. MC Blood Suckaz.

00:06:29.222 --> 00:06:30.807
I'd rather stick needles in my eyes.

00:06:33.142 --> 00:06:34.685
I'll probably do that anyway.

00:06:35.269 --> 00:06:37.563
Or you could invite someone
and have a little fun.

00:06:57.792 --> 00:06:59.127
We need to do this.

00:06:59.836 --> 00:07:02.296
Xavier didn't get
those scratches from fencing.

00:07:03.631 --> 00:07:05.007
He's hiding something.

00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:31.868
I suppose every artist needs a muse.

00:07:37.373 --> 00:07:40.334
Xavier, you just became
that much more interesting.

00:07:52.597 --> 00:07:53.431
Wednesday.

00:07:54.265 --> 00:07:55.475
Xavier.

00:07:55.558 --> 00:07:56.642
Hello.

00:07:57.643 --> 00:07:59.353
-What are you doing?
-Nothing.

00:08:00.229 --> 00:08:02.023
I just saw you come out this way.

00:08:02.523 --> 00:08:03.774
What is this place?

00:08:03.858 --> 00:08:06.944
It's kind of my private art studio.

00:08:07.987 --> 00:08:10.281
I cleared it out, fixed it up,
so Weems let me use it.

00:08:10.364 --> 00:08:13.159
How very entrepreneurial.
I would love to see inside.

00:08:13.784 --> 00:08:15.286
Why don't you give me a tour?

00:08:16.871 --> 00:08:18.623
Not right now. It's a total mess.

00:08:18.706 --> 00:08:21.000
I shadowed a crime scene photographer
last summer.

00:08:21.083 --> 00:08:22.543
I'm not easily fazed.

00:08:23.044 --> 00:08:25.796
Maybe another time.
Why were you looking for me?

00:08:26.881 --> 00:08:29.926
I wanted to go over Ms. Thornhill's
homework assignment.

00:08:31.594 --> 00:08:33.137
She didn't give us homework.

00:08:34.138 --> 00:08:35.056
Remember?

00:08:36.516 --> 00:08:37.850
Why are you really out here?

00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:41.145
Is this about a certain dance

00:08:41.229 --> 00:08:44.106
that makes you want to poke needles
into your eyes, perhaps?

00:08:45.024 --> 00:08:46.359
I'm all ears.

00:08:47.985 --> 00:08:51.864
<i>Sometimes intentions melt</i>
<i>in the face of unexpected opportunity.</i>

00:08:52.657 --> 00:08:54.617
<i>If this was my chance</i>
<i>to get up close and personal</i>

00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:56.369
<i>with a potential serial killer,</i>

00:08:57.578 --> 00:08:59.080
<i>how could I refuse?</i>

00:08:59.163 --> 00:09:01.791
-Are you really going to make me ask?
-Oh, absolutely.

00:09:11.175 --> 00:09:12.301
Would you…

00:09:17.557 --> 00:09:18.432
Would--

00:09:18.516 --> 00:09:23.437
Would you possibly consider going
to the Rave'N dance with a certain…

00:09:26.107 --> 00:09:27.024
Would--

00:09:28.526 --> 00:09:29.944
Would you go to the dance with me?

00:09:31.737 --> 00:09:34.782
Yes, Wednesday, I would love
to go to the dance with you.

00:09:35.950 --> 00:09:37.451
I thought you'd never ask.

00:09:38.327 --> 00:09:39.787
Neither did I.

00:09:41.747 --> 00:09:45.293
Oh my God! Wednesday Addams
is going to the Rave'N.

00:09:45.376 --> 00:09:47.295
My whole world is tilted!

00:09:47.378 --> 00:09:49.297
-You know what you need?
-A bullet to the head?

00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:51.090
-A dress.
-I already have one.

00:09:51.924 --> 00:09:54.010
Not the one you showed up here in!

00:09:54.093 --> 00:09:57.555
That thing was a fashion emergency
not even lightning could resuscitate.

00:09:57.638 --> 00:09:58.889
Thing, back me up here.

00:10:00.891 --> 00:10:02.351
You need something that screams,

00:10:02.435 --> 00:10:05.605
"First date. Stand back, bitches!
I have arrived!"

00:10:05.688 --> 00:10:07.523
And I know just the place!

00:10:09.650 --> 00:10:12.069
What kind of dystopian hellscape is this?

00:10:13.696 --> 00:10:16.490
Our first roomie shopping spree!

00:10:16.574 --> 00:10:19.452
The dance committee's suggesting
all white to match the theme,

00:10:19.535 --> 00:10:22.079
but that's not gonna fly with us.

00:10:22.163 --> 00:10:23.456
I have more pressing business

00:10:23.539 --> 00:10:26.542
than to worry about a dress
for a dance I don't want to attend.

00:10:27.543 --> 00:10:29.045
But I thought we were bonding.

00:10:30.379 --> 00:10:32.298
I feel I'll only slow you down.

00:10:32.381 --> 00:10:34.842
You're a gazelle. I'm a wounded fawn.

00:10:34.925 --> 00:10:36.844
Cut me loose and go run with the pack.

00:10:38.763 --> 00:10:39.889
Are you sure?

00:10:50.691 --> 00:10:53.027
I'm going to see Galpin. I'm not stop--

00:11:01.202 --> 00:11:02.536
Hi, Wednesday.

00:11:04.413 --> 00:11:06.374
That dress will certainly turn some heads.

00:11:07.875 --> 00:11:10.378
Are you collecting more
exotic trinkets for your office?

00:11:10.461 --> 00:11:12.254
Those are souvenirs from my travels.

00:11:12.338 --> 00:11:14.423
That's how I step outside of
my comfort zone.

00:11:15.132 --> 00:11:18.427
Speaking of which, are you going
to the Rave'N this weekend?

00:11:18.969 --> 00:11:21.430
I'm not required to answer
your questions out in the wild, am I?

00:11:22.306 --> 00:11:25.059
I look forward to talking about it
at our next session.

00:11:34.402 --> 00:11:36.278
We both know
that there's a monster out there.

00:11:36.362 --> 00:11:37.697
If we're going to stop it,

00:11:37.780 --> 00:11:41.033
I think it's time we put
our differences aside and work together.

00:11:41.117 --> 00:11:43.285
And this is your stake
for me to deal you in?

00:11:49.792 --> 00:11:53.045
I'm sorry, you gotta do better than that.
You got some nice detail though.

00:11:53.129 --> 00:11:55.214
-I didn't draw it.
-I need to know who did.

00:11:55.297 --> 00:11:58.008
Unless we're exchanging intel,
I'm not at liberty to say.

00:11:58.926 --> 00:12:01.929
Why would I share information
about an ongoing murder investigation

00:12:02.012 --> 00:12:03.264
with a high school kid?

00:12:03.347 --> 00:12:05.474
Because I go to Nevermore and you don't.

00:12:05.975 --> 00:12:08.394
Don't you want eyes and ears
behind those ivy-covered walls?

00:12:08.978 --> 00:12:12.773
Listen, Velma, why don't you
and the Scooby gang stick to your homework

00:12:12.857 --> 00:12:14.608
and leave investigating
to the professionals.

00:12:15.609 --> 00:12:18.320
-What?
-<i>Mayor Walker's on line two.</i>

00:12:18.404 --> 00:12:20.906
-<i>He's looking for an update.</i>
-Hey, Addams.

00:12:22.491 --> 00:12:24.201
Let me see that sketch again.

00:12:29.373 --> 00:12:31.876
The person who drew this,
that your suspect?

00:12:35.546 --> 00:12:38.591
When you bring me some concrete evidence,
maybe we'll talk.

00:12:40.384 --> 00:12:42.720
Yes, Mayor. Everything's going splendidly.

00:12:44.555 --> 00:12:46.599
My spiky little sea urchin.

00:12:47.558 --> 00:12:49.602
-That's horrible.
-That's actually her singing.

00:12:56.108 --> 00:12:58.110
Is it okay if I talk to Enid?

00:13:01.489 --> 00:13:03.365
Don't worry. I can handle him.

00:13:07.578 --> 00:13:08.496
Thanks.

00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:12.208
-I'm--
-Lucas Walker, mayor's son.

00:13:12.291 --> 00:13:14.710
Recently split from cheer captain,
Chrissy Smothers.

00:13:14.794 --> 00:13:17.505
Cute brunette who needs
to rethink her spray tan.

00:13:17.588 --> 00:13:18.631
That's kinda scary.

00:13:19.215 --> 00:13:21.926
I have a nose for gossip
and I follow half your grade on TikTok.

00:13:22.009 --> 00:13:24.845
Oh yeah, and my roommate
kicked your butt… twice.

00:13:26.055 --> 00:13:28.682
-Wednesday Addams is your roommate?
-Sure is.

00:13:29.683 --> 00:13:31.560
I know this isn't a random encounter.

00:13:32.311 --> 00:13:34.396
So, why are you sitting here,
Lucas Walker?

00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:36.482
You must want something.

00:13:36.565 --> 00:13:38.776
I've got a friend
who works at Hawte Kewture.

00:13:38.859 --> 00:13:41.362
She overheard you're on the hunt
for a date to the Rave'N.

00:13:41.862 --> 00:13:43.989
Maybe we can help each other out.

00:13:49.495 --> 00:13:51.580
Don't want to ask
what trouble you're in now.

00:13:51.664 --> 00:13:53.457
Nothing I can't handle.

00:13:53.541 --> 00:13:57.044
Your father's in particularly
frustrating form today. Avoid.

00:13:57.795 --> 00:13:59.755
Yeah, welcome to my world.

00:13:59.839 --> 00:14:02.049
You guys have the Rave'N
this weekend, right?

00:14:02.132 --> 00:14:04.593
It was all the buzz
at the Weathervane today.

00:14:04.677 --> 00:14:07.596
I must be the only one
not obsessed with this stupid dance.

00:14:08.681 --> 00:14:09.849
So, you're not going?

00:14:12.351 --> 00:14:15.563
Actually, I was forced to ask someone
as an act of self-preservation.

00:14:16.063 --> 00:14:19.316
Sure, that happens, I guess.

00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:20.276
So, who is it?

00:14:22.611 --> 00:14:23.612
Xavier.

00:14:25.781 --> 00:14:26.699
Got it.

00:14:27.616 --> 00:14:29.410
Hope you two have fun.

00:14:29.493 --> 00:14:32.663
-I'm not sure why you're upset.
-That's kind of the problem.

00:14:32.746 --> 00:14:36.250
I mean, call me crazy, Wednesday,
but you keep giving me these signals.

00:14:36.333 --> 00:14:39.545
It's not my fault I can't interpret
your emotional Morse code.

00:14:39.628 --> 00:14:41.463
Then let me spell it out.

00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:44.466
I thought we liked each other,

00:14:45.092 --> 00:14:48.512
but then you pull something like this,
and I have no idea where I stand.

00:14:48.596 --> 00:14:50.890
Am I in the "more-than-friend zone"

00:14:50.973 --> 00:14:53.100
or just a pawn
in some game you're playing?

00:14:54.059 --> 00:14:55.978
I'm just dealing with a lot right now.

00:14:56.604 --> 00:14:58.022
I need to prioritize.

00:15:02.776 --> 00:15:04.278
Thanks for clearing that up.

00:15:05.279 --> 00:15:08.741
I guess, give me a call
if I ever move up your to-do list.

00:15:13.996 --> 00:15:16.498
Not one word.

00:15:32.681 --> 00:15:35.017
Enid wouldn't let me
keep this in our dorm.

00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:37.853
No worries. <i>Mi colmena es su colmena</i>.

00:15:39.605 --> 00:15:43.275
I assume this is the creature
that's been rampaging in the woods.

00:15:44.026 --> 00:15:45.736
You've heard about it before?

00:15:45.819 --> 00:15:49.573
Rumors. Mr. Fitts banned me
from bug-hunting until further notice.

00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:53.619
Claimed a bear was on the loose,
which I knew was a lie.

00:15:53.702 --> 00:15:55.621
Didn't match their hibernation schedules.

00:15:56.747 --> 00:16:01.251
Speaking of monsters with sharp claws,
could you give this to your roomie?

00:16:01.335 --> 00:16:02.586
Put in a good word for me?

00:16:02.670 --> 00:16:04.880
I hear she's still sans date
for the Rave'N.

00:16:04.964 --> 00:16:06.090
Eugene.

00:16:06.674 --> 00:16:10.594
I know the chances of her asking me
are next to zero, but I don't care.

00:16:10.678 --> 00:16:14.139
I'll keep putting myself out there
until Enid finally… sees me.

00:16:14.890 --> 00:16:15.975
And if she never does?

00:16:16.058 --> 00:16:17.267
She will.

00:16:17.351 --> 00:16:18.894
I'm playing the long game.

00:16:18.978 --> 00:16:21.355
My moms say people
will appreciate me when I'm older.

00:16:21.438 --> 00:16:23.691
They're probably just trying
to make me feel better, but--

00:16:23.774 --> 00:16:26.443
Listen, people like me and you,
we're different.

00:16:26.527 --> 00:16:30.781
We're original thinkers, intrepid outliers
in this vast cesspool of adolescence.

00:16:30.864 --> 00:16:33.951
We don't need these inane
rites of passage to validate who we are.

00:16:34.535 --> 00:16:36.453
So you're not going to the Rave'N either?

00:16:39.331 --> 00:16:40.457
Actually, I am.

00:16:41.083 --> 00:16:42.084
With Xavier.

00:16:43.460 --> 00:16:44.294
I see.

00:16:44.378 --> 00:16:46.213
It's not like I like Xavier.

00:16:47.339 --> 00:16:49.133
I just have ulterior motives.

00:16:49.633 --> 00:16:53.137
Sketches are the closest thing I have
to a lead to try and stop this thing.

00:16:57.182 --> 00:16:58.809
That circle…

00:16:58.892 --> 00:17:00.269
I think I know where that is.

00:17:00.352 --> 00:17:01.270
Show me.

00:17:05.232 --> 00:17:06.900
It's definitely a match.

00:17:06.984 --> 00:17:08.569
What were you doing out here?

00:17:08.652 --> 00:17:09.820
Collecting specimens.

00:17:09.903 --> 00:17:12.781
This place is ground zero
for horny gypsy moths.

00:17:14.033 --> 00:17:15.492
You think it's in there?

00:17:15.576 --> 00:17:16.827
Only one way to find out.

00:17:23.917 --> 00:17:26.712
I'm not a huge fan of enclosed spaces.

00:17:26.795 --> 00:17:28.005
I'm claustrophobic.

00:17:29.048 --> 00:17:31.008
If you hear me screaming bloody murder,

00:17:31.091 --> 00:17:33.427
there's a good chance
I'm just enjoying myself.

00:17:48.692 --> 00:17:50.444
This is definitely its lair.

00:17:51.570 --> 00:17:53.405
Are those human?

00:17:55.324 --> 00:17:57.576
No, I think it's got a taste for venison.

00:18:03.791 --> 00:18:04.875
Check this out.

00:18:17.096 --> 00:18:17.971
Yahtzee.

00:18:21.391 --> 00:18:22.309
What is that?

00:18:22.810 --> 00:18:24.061
Concrete proof.

00:18:35.656 --> 00:18:37.366
All right, I won't be long.

00:18:38.033 --> 00:18:41.036
I just need to find something
to match against the claw's DNA.

00:19:19.366 --> 00:19:20.409
What are you doing?

00:19:21.285 --> 00:19:23.370
How do you know
what the monster looks like?

00:19:24.371 --> 00:19:26.206
Or are these all just self-portraits?

00:19:26.290 --> 00:19:29.001
What, you think it's me?
I saved your life.

00:19:29.084 --> 00:19:32.337
So did the monster. Or was that you
the night Rowan was killed?

00:19:32.421 --> 00:19:34.923
-You so are out of line now.
-I'm trying to uncover the truth.

00:19:35.007 --> 00:19:37.426
And your art seems
to have a recurring motif.

00:19:40.179 --> 00:19:41.096
Yeah.

00:19:42.639 --> 00:19:44.975
This creature's been haunting
my dreams for weeks.

00:19:45.559 --> 00:19:49.563
I try to block it out, but I can't.
So I just… come in here and paint it.

00:19:50.147 --> 00:19:53.525
When I was painting this one,
claws reached out and took a swipe at me.

00:19:54.151 --> 00:19:55.235
That's how I got these.

00:19:56.195 --> 00:19:58.405
I thought you were able
to control your ability.

00:19:59.489 --> 00:20:02.075
-Not when it comes to this.
-Maybe it's your guilty conscience.

00:20:02.159 --> 00:20:04.036
I told you I'm not the monster, okay?

00:20:08.290 --> 00:20:10.375
You just happened to draw pictures of it,

00:20:10.459 --> 00:20:12.294
down to the location of its lair
in the woods?

00:20:13.086 --> 00:20:14.880
Those are some pretty vivid dreams.

00:20:16.089 --> 00:20:17.090
You were in here.

00:20:18.091 --> 00:20:20.010
Before, when I caught you outside.

00:20:21.053 --> 00:20:23.305
That's the only reason
you asked me to the Rave'N?

00:20:25.265 --> 00:20:27.059
To try and cover.

00:20:29.394 --> 00:20:31.813
-You are unbelievable.
-It's nothing personal.

00:20:31.897 --> 00:20:33.398
No, it never is with you, is it?

00:20:34.107 --> 00:20:37.486
I mean, do you even care about anyone
or anything at all, Wednesday?

00:20:40.906 --> 00:20:41.907
Get out!

00:20:55.295 --> 00:20:58.340
Yeah, I know Inez
is usually three sheets to the wind,

00:20:58.423 --> 00:20:59.841
but she keeps calling the mayor

00:20:59.925 --> 00:21:02.803
and she's BS-ing that there's
lights on at the old Gates place.

00:21:02.886 --> 00:21:05.806
So do a drive-by,
make sure there's no squatters.

00:21:09.851 --> 00:21:11.186
That's the claw of the monster

00:21:11.270 --> 00:21:13.855
and that's a dried blood sample
from a potential suspect.

00:21:13.939 --> 00:21:16.316
He used it to dab scratches on his neck.

00:21:16.817 --> 00:21:18.694
Run the DNA test and see if they match.

00:21:19.695 --> 00:21:20.862
I'm sorry, do I work for you?

00:21:20.946 --> 00:21:23.573
You asked for concrete evidence.
That's it.

00:21:24.157 --> 00:21:25.450
Where'd you get this?

00:21:25.534 --> 00:21:26.660
And who's the suspect?

00:21:27.786 --> 00:21:30.205
Run the test first,
then I'll explain everything.

00:21:30.289 --> 00:21:31.748
I'm not playing games, Addams.

00:21:31.832 --> 00:21:33.000
Neither am I, Sheriff.

00:21:38.171 --> 00:21:42.467
Bernice, bring me
a DNA authorization form, please.

00:21:46.013 --> 00:21:46.888
Hmm.

00:21:51.977 --> 00:21:53.478
Why so glum?

00:21:53.562 --> 00:21:56.606
Saw Enid at lunch.
Asked if she got my honey.

00:21:57.399 --> 00:21:58.942
It's not like I didn't warn you.

00:22:02.863 --> 00:22:05.407
Since neither you nor I
have a date to the dance--

00:22:05.490 --> 00:22:07.117
-We should go together!
-What?

00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:10.912
No, I was going to suggest we stake
out the cave and identify the monster.

00:22:13.790 --> 00:22:15.167
Whoever it may be.

00:22:22.799 --> 00:22:26.553
So… I hear you might be
free tomorrow night after all.

00:22:46.365 --> 00:22:47.449
Thank you.

00:23:11.348 --> 00:23:13.100
Okay, have fun with it!

00:23:14.768 --> 00:23:16.311
You look gorgeous!

00:23:16.395 --> 00:23:17.896
So gorgeous!

00:23:17.979 --> 00:23:19.856
Welcome to this year's Rave'N!

00:23:19.940 --> 00:23:22.734
Oh, beautiful! What a nice top!

00:23:22.818 --> 00:23:24.486
Have a dance for me!

00:23:31.368 --> 00:23:32.994
Welcome to the Rave'N.

00:23:53.098 --> 00:23:55.684
Well, here's to a night
they'll never forget.

00:23:55.767 --> 00:23:57.227
Careful what you wish for.

00:23:57.811 --> 00:23:59.729
You were a Nevermore student once.

00:23:59.813 --> 00:24:03.400
Don't you remember being full of hope
and excitement about the Rave'N?

00:24:04.651 --> 00:24:06.778
All I remember is disappointment.

00:24:07.529 --> 00:24:09.948
The boy I asked
turned me down for another girl.

00:24:13.702 --> 00:24:14.870
Morticia Frump, in fact.

00:24:15.745 --> 00:24:16.621
Wednesday's mother?

00:24:19.166 --> 00:24:21.376
Oh, make sure nobody spikes the punch.

00:24:21.460 --> 00:24:23.670
We can't afford a single misstep tonight.

00:24:36.725 --> 00:24:37.851
I'm coming, Eugene!

00:24:39.936 --> 00:24:42.981
Hey, did you grab
any extra batteries for the flash--

00:24:44.649 --> 00:24:45.484
Tyler.

00:24:46.985 --> 00:24:49.112
I got your invite.

00:24:49.821 --> 00:24:51.740
Guessing you had Thing
drop it in the tip jar?

00:24:53.700 --> 00:24:54.534
Good guess.

00:24:54.618 --> 00:24:58.997
After our last conversation, I wasn't sure
I'd even get to speak to you again, but…

00:25:00.165 --> 00:25:02.167
Well, your note was so genuine and…

00:25:03.668 --> 00:25:04.503
sweet.

00:25:04.586 --> 00:25:06.338
Totally took me by surprise.

00:25:07.464 --> 00:25:08.298
Me too.

00:25:11.551 --> 00:25:13.136
Well, now that I'm here,

00:25:13.803 --> 00:25:14.971
I'm glad I came.

00:25:18.767 --> 00:25:20.268
You need a few minutes?

00:25:21.269 --> 00:25:24.940
Genuine and sweet?
How could you do this to me?

00:25:36.826 --> 00:25:37.911
How'd you pay for it?

00:25:41.248 --> 00:25:43.166
Five-finger discount, of course.

00:25:48.046 --> 00:25:49.673
Thing, don't look.

00:26:13.613 --> 00:26:16.074
Wow, you look…

00:26:16.783 --> 00:26:19.119
Unrecognizable? Ridiculous?

00:26:19.202 --> 00:26:22.122
A classic example of
female objectification for the male gaze?

00:26:24.082 --> 00:26:24.916
Amazing.

00:26:26.585 --> 00:26:28.837
I mean it, Wednesday. You look beautiful.

00:26:33.717 --> 00:26:34.551
Eugene?

00:26:34.634 --> 00:26:37.637
Wednesday, what's going on?

00:26:40.223 --> 00:26:42.517
What happened to staking out the cave?

00:26:47.606 --> 00:26:51.401
Sure, I get it.
Guess I'll check out the woods myself.

00:26:51.484 --> 00:26:52.902
Don't go alone.

00:26:53.445 --> 00:26:55.447
It's too dangerous. Stand down.

00:26:57.616 --> 00:26:59.826
We'll go together tomorrow night,
understood?

00:27:08.001 --> 00:27:09.336
Staking out a cave?

00:27:10.629 --> 00:27:12.589
A Hummer never shies away from danger.

00:27:28.521 --> 00:27:30.106
Is that an abominable snowman?

00:27:30.690 --> 00:27:33.652
Oh my God!
You can't say that, it's offensive!

00:27:34.653 --> 00:27:35.904
The correct name is Yeti.

00:27:35.987 --> 00:27:38.823
Oh, sorry. Do any go here?

00:27:38.907 --> 00:27:41.910
Not anymore.
They've been extinct since the 1950s.

00:27:41.993 --> 00:27:44.788
Our science teacher Ms. Thornhill
chaired the dance committee this year.

00:27:44.871 --> 00:27:46.623
She wanted the Rave'N to feel relevant.

00:27:46.706 --> 00:27:49.584
So our theme is climate crisis
meets extinction event.

00:27:49.668 --> 00:27:50.627
But in a fun way!

00:27:50.710 --> 00:27:53.880
Okay, the theme
of our last dance was Hawaiian nights.

00:27:53.963 --> 00:27:55.256
-Yeti-tini?
-Yeah--

00:27:57.550 --> 00:28:00.804
Oh my God, I'm so sorry! Let me fix that!

00:28:04.015 --> 00:28:05.016
Enid?

00:28:07.894 --> 00:28:09.270
I thought that was you.

00:28:10.772 --> 00:28:11.940
Is that your date?

00:28:12.524 --> 00:28:16.653
Yes, and he's having
the best time with me.

00:28:16.736 --> 00:28:19.572
We are both loving this dance…

00:28:20.407 --> 00:28:21.533
together.

00:28:23.910 --> 00:28:24.869
Sweet.

00:28:33.586 --> 00:28:36.881
Does your mood have to do
with a certain pig-tailed goth girl?

00:28:38.591 --> 00:28:40.051
She's not here.

00:28:40.593 --> 00:28:41.428
We are.

00:28:42.971 --> 00:28:44.222
You're right. I'm sorry.

00:28:45.056 --> 00:28:47.225
I do really like being here with you, so…

00:28:47.308 --> 00:28:51.229
-I appreciate the last-minute invitation.
-No more talking about Wednesday Addams.

00:28:51.813 --> 00:28:52.647
Deal?

00:28:56.901 --> 00:28:58.236
Yo, check it out.

00:29:01.906 --> 00:29:04.576
Wednesday totally busted out of
her cocoon.

00:29:08.580 --> 00:29:10.165
Like a death's-head moth.

00:29:10.915 --> 00:29:12.792
Do you see Bianca's face?

00:29:12.876 --> 00:29:14.544
She's not going to be happy.

00:29:14.627 --> 00:29:17.756
Wednesday Addams. What a lovely surprise.

00:29:17.839 --> 00:29:19.132
Ms. Thornhill.

00:29:19.758 --> 00:29:21.134
-This is Tyler--
-Galpin.

00:29:22.844 --> 00:29:26.473
Uh, yeah. Double-cap, no foam,
two pumps of sugar-free vanilla.

00:29:26.556 --> 00:29:30.185
It's a small town.
It's hard to keep secrets.

00:29:31.311 --> 00:29:32.979
I'm gonna go get us some drinks.

00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:47.827
OMG! I love the look!

00:29:48.411 --> 00:29:50.121
Interesting choice of date though.

00:29:51.915 --> 00:29:53.041
I could say the same.

00:29:54.459 --> 00:29:55.752
It's not what it looks like.

00:29:55.835 --> 00:29:59.047
Good, because that pilgrim
already has two strikes in my book.

00:29:59.130 --> 00:30:01.299
Lucas is trying to make his ex jealous.

00:30:01.382 --> 00:30:02.801
I'm trying to make Ajax jealous.

00:30:02.884 --> 00:30:03.718
It's a win-win.

00:30:06.513 --> 00:30:09.015
Wednesday, I come in peace.

00:30:09.098 --> 00:30:11.476
That's a shame. I brought my pocket mace.

00:30:12.894 --> 00:30:14.270
The medieval kind.

00:30:24.489 --> 00:30:27.325
-Can't believe you brought him.
-Why are you bringing this up?

00:30:27.408 --> 00:30:29.619
As if this dance weren't tedious enough.

00:30:30.119 --> 00:30:31.621
You don't know what he did to me.

00:30:38.795 --> 00:30:39.879
Enlighten me.

00:30:45.552 --> 00:30:47.428
I'm so sorry about your pants.

00:30:48.638 --> 00:30:51.307
Are those the playoffs?
Who's winning, the Penguins or the Ducks?

00:30:51.391 --> 00:30:53.810
-You follow pro hockey?
-Lifelong Sharks fan.

00:30:53.893 --> 00:30:55.270
I grew up with older brothers.

00:30:55.353 --> 00:30:58.273
It was like, "Watch hockey
or we'll go all Tang Lung on you."

00:30:58.356 --> 00:30:59.983
You mean Tang Lung from <i>Way of the Dragon?</i>

00:31:00.567 --> 00:31:02.652
Only the best kung fu movie ever made!

00:31:02.735 --> 00:31:04.737
You are different!

00:31:06.698 --> 00:31:08.116
You up for getting down?

00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:10.034
Yeah.

00:31:18.918 --> 00:31:20.086
Eugene Ottinger.

00:31:20.670 --> 00:31:22.171
2100 hours.

00:31:22.881 --> 00:31:24.716
No movement at the cave.

00:31:24.799 --> 00:31:26.009
No sign of the target.

00:31:27.802 --> 00:31:28.720
Although…

00:31:29.846 --> 00:31:33.099
I just heard a rare
club-horned grasshopper.

00:31:41.441 --> 00:31:44.819
Was it the thin mountain air
or the Yeti-tinis that got to you?

00:31:46.029 --> 00:31:47.780
Xavier told me what you did last year.

00:31:48.364 --> 00:31:51.910
How you and your friends assaulted him
and destroyed his mural on Outreach Day.

00:31:59.125 --> 00:32:01.085
I guess that was inevitable.

00:32:05.089 --> 00:32:08.217
Look, I… I wish I could say
that it was an accident,

00:32:08.301 --> 00:32:11.554
or that it wasn't half as bad
as it sounds, but I'd be lying.

00:32:12.513 --> 00:32:15.683
And he could have made things
a lot worse for me, but he didn't.

00:32:17.518 --> 00:32:18.770
Why'd you do it?

00:32:19.938 --> 00:32:22.190
I mean, I could give you
a million excuses, but…

00:32:23.191 --> 00:32:25.693
the truth is I'm still
trying to figure that out.

00:32:27.862 --> 00:32:30.490
I got sent away to this boot camp

00:32:30.573 --> 00:32:33.660
and realized that's not the version
of myself I want to be.

00:32:34.160 --> 00:32:37.872
A bitter townie that blames everyone else
for the shitty hand he's been dealt.

00:32:39.707 --> 00:32:43.169
Look, I did a terrible thing,
but I swear I'm not a terrible person.

00:32:48.174 --> 00:32:50.927
Did you think I was going to judge you
over some lousy prank?

00:32:51.469 --> 00:32:52.762
I would have taken it further.

00:32:52.845 --> 00:32:54.931
Like putting piranhas in a swimming pool?

00:32:56.766 --> 00:32:59.560
I may have done
a little digging on you after we met.

00:33:00.061 --> 00:33:01.312
I'd do it again.

00:33:03.481 --> 00:33:05.233
I knew there was a reason I liked you.

00:34:31.402 --> 00:34:32.403
Come on!

00:34:33.112 --> 00:34:34.280
I'll be right back.

00:34:43.790 --> 00:34:44.916
Oh, hi.

00:35:06.145 --> 00:35:07.355
Do me a favor.

00:35:11.275 --> 00:35:13.736
Take off your amulet
and make me forget about her.

00:35:15.696 --> 00:35:18.783
-I can't believe you'd ask me to do that.
-You said no strings.

00:35:19.951 --> 00:35:24.080
You broke up with me because you thought
I was manipulating you with my siren song.

00:35:24.163 --> 00:35:27.125
Now you want me to use it
to help you get over another girl?

00:35:49.897 --> 00:35:50.898
Let's go.

00:35:56.028 --> 00:35:57.864
-Come on.
-You got it? Take it.

00:35:58.698 --> 00:36:00.449
Keep feedin' it. Let's go. Come on.

00:36:03.703 --> 00:36:05.413
-Move! Move!
-I'll do it.

00:36:07.331 --> 00:36:09.542
I was thinking
maybe this isn't such a good idea.

00:36:09.625 --> 00:36:11.961
I don't want my dad
to get any blowback, you know?

00:36:12.044 --> 00:36:14.422
Dude, you're the whole reason
we're doing this!

00:36:15.006 --> 00:36:17.717
To get revenge on those freaks
for nuking Crackstone's fountain!

00:36:17.800 --> 00:36:20.845
Don't tell me you've gone soft like Tyler.
Come on, let's go.

00:36:30.479 --> 00:36:33.941
Eugene Ottinger. 2242 hours.

00:36:34.025 --> 00:36:36.402
Potential suspect has arrived at location.

00:36:46.204 --> 00:36:47.121
Oh my God.

00:37:03.429 --> 00:37:07.266
Whoever invented high heels
clearly had a side hustle as a torturer.

00:37:09.018 --> 00:37:10.770
As my dear mother always says,

00:37:11.270 --> 00:37:14.732
"Fire tests gold,
suffering tests a woman."

00:37:17.944 --> 00:37:19.862
Speaking of suffering, where's your date?

00:37:20.404 --> 00:37:22.573
I didn't see you and Xavier
on the dance floor.

00:37:22.657 --> 00:37:23.741
We had a little tiff.

00:37:25.034 --> 00:37:26.577
About you, actually.

00:37:31.249 --> 00:37:32.792
You don't know what it's like.

00:37:34.210 --> 00:37:35.628
Being beautiful and popular?

00:37:36.254 --> 00:37:38.172
Never knowing people's true feelings.

00:37:38.965 --> 00:37:40.925
If someone likes me for me.

00:37:42.510 --> 00:37:43.928
What about your amulet?

00:37:44.011 --> 00:37:45.805
It's not foolproof.

00:37:46.305 --> 00:37:48.224
It's a mild prophylactic, so to speak.

00:37:50.351 --> 00:37:52.144
That's why Xavier broke up with me.

00:37:53.104 --> 00:37:54.772
He could never fully trust me.

00:37:55.982 --> 00:37:58.693
The worst part is I could
never trust his feelings either.

00:38:00.194 --> 00:38:02.196
I never knew if they were real or not.

00:38:06.534 --> 00:38:07.618
You're lucky.

00:38:08.536 --> 00:38:09.704
Do tell.

00:38:10.705 --> 00:38:13.165
You don't care what people think of you.

00:38:18.087 --> 00:38:20.131
Honestly, I wish I cared a little more.

00:38:51.912 --> 00:38:53.581
It's time for the big finish.

00:38:56.792 --> 00:38:59.712
Yo! Almost eleven o'clockity,

00:38:59.795 --> 00:39:03.132
so haul it out
on the dance floor one last time

00:39:03.215 --> 00:39:05.634
before the Rave'N says "Nevermore!"

00:40:31.637 --> 00:40:32.596
Let's go!

00:40:41.856 --> 00:40:44.275
They couldn't even
spring for real pigs' blood.

00:40:46.569 --> 00:40:47.778
It's only paint.

00:41:03.502 --> 00:41:05.421
Wednesday! Are you okay?

00:41:05.504 --> 00:41:08.215
Eugene is in the woods. He's in danger.

00:41:17.892 --> 00:41:20.561
-What the hell are you doing?
-Texting my dad. He's on his way.

00:41:20.644 --> 00:41:24.315
-Have you seen Wednesday? I lost her.
-How should I know? She's your date.

00:41:25.941 --> 00:41:27.693
-Let's go.
-That was crazy.

00:41:27.776 --> 00:41:29.820
-Come on. Get it.
-Let's go.

00:41:30.613 --> 00:41:31.780
You did this?

00:41:32.281 --> 00:41:35.201
I can't believe
I fell for your crap.

00:41:36.660 --> 00:41:39.705
-Enid, after Crackstone's statue--
-I thought you were different.

00:41:41.332 --> 00:41:42.791
I thought you liked me.

00:41:43.792 --> 00:41:46.253
-Wolf out!
-Wolf out!

00:41:46.337 --> 00:41:48.881
-Wolf out!

00:41:48.964 --> 00:41:51.300
-Get away from her!
-Let's go!

00:41:55.221 --> 00:41:56.805
-Are you okay?

00:41:58.974 --> 00:42:00.851
I didn't even want to go with him.

00:42:01.602 --> 00:42:03.020
I wanted to go with you.

00:42:03.521 --> 00:42:04.897
So why didn't you ask me?

00:42:04.980 --> 00:42:08.025
'Cause you blew me off the other night
and never told me why.

00:42:10.236 --> 00:42:12.279
I was too embarrassed to tell you,

00:42:12.363 --> 00:42:15.032
but I… accidentally looked in the mirror

00:42:15.115 --> 00:42:17.535
and kind of stoned myself with my snakes.

00:42:23.082 --> 00:42:24.667
Whoa. We should, uh…

00:42:25.334 --> 00:42:27.795
We should probably take it slow. Right?

00:42:28.462 --> 00:42:29.505
Totally agree.

00:43:17.219 --> 00:43:18.512
Eugene!

00:43:20.180 --> 00:43:21.223
Eugene!

00:43:30.024 --> 00:43:31.066
Eugene?

00:43:47.625 --> 00:43:48.667
Eugene?

00:43:49.460 --> 00:43:51.670
Wednesday! Over here!

00:44:05.601 --> 00:44:06.602
Eugene?

00:44:09.980 --> 00:44:10.939
Eugene.

00:44:24.953 --> 00:44:25.871
Oh my God!

00:44:28.415 --> 00:44:30.376
-Is he alive?
