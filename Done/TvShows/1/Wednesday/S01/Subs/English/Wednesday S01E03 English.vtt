WEBVTT

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:12.971
<i>Let's assess, shall we?</i>

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:16.057
<i>Bag over my head</i>
<i>for optimal disorientation,</i>

00:00:17.142 --> 00:00:20.228
<i>wrists tied tight enough</i>
<i>to cut off circulation,</i>

00:00:20.311 --> 00:00:22.689
<i>and no idea if I'm going to live or die.</i>

00:00:24.357 --> 00:00:26.067
<i>It's definitely my kind of party.</i>

00:00:26.901 --> 00:00:29.612
Who dares breach our inner sanctum?

00:00:29.696 --> 00:00:31.322
You can take the mask off, Bianca.

00:00:33.491 --> 00:00:35.452
<i>And just like that, my hopes were dashed</i>

00:00:35.535 --> 00:00:37.871
<i>against the rocks</i>
<i>of bitter disappointment.</i>

00:00:37.954 --> 00:00:40.206
<i>My foe was no psychotic killer.</i>

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.459
<i>More like a bunch of high school clowns.</i>

00:00:42.542 --> 00:00:44.419
Wait, I preferred you with it on.

00:00:44.502 --> 00:00:46.713
-How did you get down here?
-Rowan showed me.

00:00:48.006 --> 00:00:48.840
Left pocket.

00:00:53.595 --> 00:00:55.847
I tracked the watermark to the Poe statue.

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:58.308
-Then I solved the riddle.
-Wait, there's a riddle?

00:00:58.391 --> 00:00:59.934
I thought we just snapped twice.

00:01:00.435 --> 00:01:02.103
Well, aren't you
the brightest in the bunch?

00:01:02.687 --> 00:01:05.023
The Nightshades are an elite social club.

00:01:05.106 --> 00:01:06.191
Emphasis on elite.

00:01:06.274 --> 00:01:09.903
We have roof parties, campouts,
the occasional midnight skinny-dip.

00:01:09.986 --> 00:01:11.571
And Yoko's an amateur mixologist.

00:01:11.654 --> 00:01:14.866
She makes a killer virgin mojito.
It can get pretty wild.

00:01:15.658 --> 00:01:17.660
Wow. Do you guys even have a bedtime?

00:01:18.203 --> 00:01:20.371
Last I heard,
the Nightshades had been disbanded.

00:01:20.455 --> 00:01:25.043
Yeah, the group kind of lost its charter
30 years ago after some normie kid died.

00:01:25.126 --> 00:01:26.836
But we have
a lot of wealthy alumni,

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.714
so Weems looks the other way
as long as nobody makes any waves.

00:01:29.798 --> 00:01:32.842
-Someone like Rowan?
-We booted that loser last semester.

00:01:34.177 --> 00:01:36.346
Question is,
what are we gonna do with her?

00:01:37.764 --> 00:01:39.933
Only members are allowed in this library.

00:01:43.895 --> 00:01:46.314
-I say we invite her to pledge.
-What?

00:01:47.065 --> 00:01:47.982
She is a legacy.

00:01:48.066 --> 00:01:51.736
After the crap she pulled in the Poe Cup,
there's no way in hell.

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:54.697
We talk about not making waves?
She's a tsunami.

00:01:54.781 --> 00:01:58.118
Just because I beat you at your own game?
Let me save you the trouble.

00:01:58.201 --> 00:01:59.828
I'm not interested in joining.

00:02:00.411 --> 00:02:01.996
You're seriously turning us down?

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:03.289
Can you believe it?

00:02:04.415 --> 00:02:05.250
Untie her.

00:02:05.333 --> 00:02:06.835
I freed myself five minutes ago.

00:02:12.841 --> 00:02:14.843
Do you want a matching black eye?

00:02:23.393 --> 00:02:25.895
It's amateurs like you
who give kidnapping a bad name.

00:02:47.542 --> 00:02:49.794
<i>There were</i>
<i>so many threads to my investigation,</i>

00:02:49.878 --> 00:02:51.171
<i>I could weave a burial shroud.</i>

00:02:51.754 --> 00:02:55.341
<i>I still have no idea how Rowan</i>
<i>mysteriously rose from the dead.</i>

00:02:55.425 --> 00:02:57.468
<i>Or why that monster is prowling the woods.</i>

00:02:58.469 --> 00:03:01.556
<i>But right now,</i>
<i>nothing intrigues me more than this book.</i>

00:03:02.223 --> 00:03:05.351
<i>If I'm going to be responsible</i>
<i>for Nevermore's demise,</i>

00:03:05.435 --> 00:03:06.769
<i>the question is,</i>

00:03:07.353 --> 00:03:10.148
<i>why am I sharing</i>
<i>this apocalypse with a pilgrim?</i>

00:03:15.945 --> 00:03:18.448
All students will report
for their volunteer jobs

00:03:18.531 --> 00:03:19.866
at 10:00 a.m. sharp,

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:22.076
followed by a community lunch at 1:00.

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:28.208
As you know, this year Outreach Day
culminates in a very special event,

00:03:28.291 --> 00:03:31.920
the dedication of a new memorial statue
in the town square,

00:03:32.503 --> 00:03:35.965
which will also include
performances by Nevermore students.

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:40.053
As representatives of our school,

00:03:40.136 --> 00:03:43.431
I trust you will all
put your best face forward.

00:03:43.973 --> 00:03:45.350
-Yeah.
-Yes!

00:03:53.191 --> 00:03:55.443
Yes! I got Pilgrim World.

00:03:56.027 --> 00:03:58.112
I have natural people skills
and a love of performing,

00:03:58.196 --> 00:03:59.906
so it's kind of the obvi choice.

00:04:00.406 --> 00:04:01.407
What'd you get?

00:04:02.992 --> 00:04:04.744
Uriah's Heap, whatever that is.

00:04:04.827 --> 00:04:07.705
Ew. It's this weird, creepy antique store.

00:04:08.539 --> 00:04:09.499
You'll love it though.

00:04:10.667 --> 00:04:13.753
I'm crossing my claws Ajax and I
will be outreaching together.

00:04:14.254 --> 00:04:16.297
Oh my God, I got the Weathervane.

00:04:16.381 --> 00:04:18.258
Dude, trade with me.
Come on, trade with me!

00:04:19.717 --> 00:04:22.095
Wednesday, don't worry about your cello.

00:04:22.178 --> 00:04:24.889
I'll have it brought
to the town square this afternoon.

00:04:25.723 --> 00:04:26.557
My cello?

00:04:26.641 --> 00:04:29.394
I caught your rooftop serenade
the other night.

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:31.187
Impressive.

00:04:31.938 --> 00:04:35.316
I volunteered you to accompany
the Jericho High School marching band

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:36.234
at the ceremony.

00:04:37.026 --> 00:04:41.489
I'm sure it won't be too challenging
to play an uplifting Fleetwood Mac melody.

00:04:42.365 --> 00:04:45.118
As long as you promise
to hang me as a witch afterwards.

00:05:01.259 --> 00:05:04.721
-Why are you staring at a blank wall?
-It wasn't blank last Outreach Day.

00:05:05.722 --> 00:05:08.433
Are you still stewing
because I rejected your invitation?

00:05:09.058 --> 00:05:10.476
I did go out on a limb for you.

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:14.689
Please. I'm just cannon fodder in whatever
cold war you're waging with Bianca.

00:05:14.772 --> 00:05:17.025
-I have more pressing issues.
-Like what?

00:05:17.108 --> 00:05:19.235
Tracking down the monster
that killed your roommate.

00:05:19.319 --> 00:05:21.321
Oh my god.
For the last time, Rowan was expelled.

00:05:21.404 --> 00:05:23.614
-Everyone saw him leave.
-Have you spoken to him since?

00:05:25.283 --> 00:05:27.744
I texted him a few times,
but I never heard back.

00:05:27.827 --> 00:05:30.204
I just figured he wanted
Nevermore in his rearview mirror.

00:05:30.288 --> 00:05:31.331
Or he's dead.

00:05:31.414 --> 00:05:33.875
I don't know why you care.
It's not like you knew the guy.

00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:36.044
I'm not sure why you care so little.

00:05:36.127 --> 00:05:40.089
People can dismiss me and make a million
other excuses, but I'm not gonna stop.

00:05:41.007 --> 00:05:44.052
Oh, great. I guess you can
add "thief" to your resume.

00:05:44.135 --> 00:05:47.263
I don't know what the big deal is about
an old Nightshade's journal anyways.

00:05:47.347 --> 00:05:50.099
You didn't seem surprised
when I showed you this last night.

00:05:50.183 --> 00:05:51.893
You've seen it before, haven't you?

00:05:52.727 --> 00:05:55.438
Yeah. A couple days
before the Harvest Festival.

00:05:55.521 --> 00:05:56.814
It was open on Rowan's desk.

00:05:56.898 --> 00:05:59.817
I assumed he stole it after
we kicked him out of the Nightshades.

00:06:00.318 --> 00:06:03.654
Then I confronted him about it,
and he kind of went ballistic on me.

00:06:04.238 --> 00:06:05.948
-It is unbelievable--
-Shut up!

00:06:06.032 --> 00:06:07.325
-How can you?
-You're crazy!

00:06:09.494 --> 00:06:12.205
He threw you against the wall
with his telekinesis.

00:06:13.456 --> 00:06:14.499
Yeah.

00:06:15.541 --> 00:06:16.751
How did you know that?

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:18.544
Lucky guess.

00:06:20.171 --> 00:06:24.217
It's weird that you're in this.
This journal is like, what, 30 years old?

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:26.260
What's Crackstone doing
in the picture with you?

00:06:26.344 --> 00:06:27.595
You know who that is?

00:06:28.179 --> 00:06:29.430
Yeah, it's Joseph Crackstone.

00:06:29.514 --> 00:06:31.599
He's, like, Jericho's founding father.

00:06:31.682 --> 00:06:32.934
He's a big deal around here.

00:06:33.017 --> 00:06:34.185
Yeah, look.

00:06:35.144 --> 00:06:36.020
That's him.

00:06:47.156 --> 00:06:48.699
-Sheriff.
-Yeah.

00:06:48.783 --> 00:06:50.410
You remember my son, Lucas?

00:06:50.493 --> 00:06:54.122
I sure do. I ran into him and his buddies
last week at the Weathervane.

00:06:55.415 --> 00:06:56.749
I'd better get to work.

00:06:56.833 --> 00:06:58.876
Hey, no trouble today. You got it?

00:07:04.424 --> 00:07:06.175
Hey, don't look too excited.

00:07:06.259 --> 00:07:08.970
Those outcast kids might think
we're happy to have 'em.

00:07:09.053 --> 00:07:12.098
We got something lurking in the woods,
connected to that school.

00:07:12.181 --> 00:07:15.226
Come on, would you stop
pointing fingers at Nevermore?

00:07:15.309 --> 00:07:17.437
You know how much Jericho
depends on that place.

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:21.524
Who do you think pays for our roads,
our parks… even your salary?

00:07:21.607 --> 00:07:25.153
I'm just doing my job, looking out
for the well-being of our town, boss.

00:07:25.236 --> 00:07:27.155
Don't lecture me, Donovan.

00:07:27.238 --> 00:07:29.657
Before the good citizens of Jericho
elected me mayor,

00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:31.284
I used to wear that badge, remember?

00:07:32.285 --> 00:07:35.788
Mm-hmm. You never struck me
as much of a history buff back then.

00:07:35.872 --> 00:07:38.583
If it's good for business,
then it's good for Jericho.

00:07:38.666 --> 00:07:40.751
Especially if your business
is Pilgrim World.

00:07:40.835 --> 00:07:41.836
Hey.

00:07:42.837 --> 00:07:45.381
Just find the damn bear
and take care of it.

00:07:47.592 --> 00:07:48.509
Mmm.

00:07:48.593 --> 00:07:50.344
All right. Everyone take a seat.

00:07:50.428 --> 00:07:52.638
We have a special announcement.

00:07:55.725 --> 00:07:57.894
Welcome, welcome, Nevermore Academy.

00:07:57.977 --> 00:08:01.814
Now, on behalf of
the entire Jericho community,

00:08:01.898 --> 00:08:04.859
we are so, so pleased
to have you all here today.

00:08:04.942 --> 00:08:09.071
Your generosity and hard work
are truly… outreachous!

00:08:11.449 --> 00:08:15.953
Okay, everyone. We'll see you
back here at one o'clock for lunch. Enjoy!

00:08:23.586 --> 00:08:24.587
Enid.

00:08:25.546 --> 00:08:27.256
Switch volunteer assignments.

00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:30.426
What? No.
Uriah's Heap is definitely not my bag.

00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:33.095
It's an emergency.
I need to check out Pilgrim World.

00:08:33.179 --> 00:08:35.598
But Wednesday, this is not a fair trade.

00:08:35.681 --> 00:08:39.227
Why would I agree to spend the entire day
at some dumpy emporium of crapola?

00:08:39.310 --> 00:08:41.604
Because Ajax is volunteering there.

00:08:41.687 --> 00:08:43.189
Thing sneaked a peek at his assignment.

00:08:43.272 --> 00:08:44.649
-But if you're not interested--
-No!

00:08:45.608 --> 00:08:47.902
Oh my God, thank you. You're the best!

00:09:06.462 --> 00:09:09.048
Welcome to Pilgrim World!

00:09:09.131 --> 00:09:12.134
Witch trials every day!

00:09:12.218 --> 00:09:14.178
Two o'clock, four o'clock!

00:09:14.262 --> 00:09:16.097
Hey, man! Woman!

00:09:22.103 --> 00:09:24.480
Hey, Wednesday,
want to grab a Hummers group photo?

00:09:26.732 --> 00:09:27.567
Guess not.

00:09:28.359 --> 00:09:31.988
Good morrow, my young Nevermore kin.

00:09:32.697 --> 00:09:35.700
I am Mistress Arlene. A real OC.

00:09:37.118 --> 00:09:38.536
Original colonist.

00:09:38.619 --> 00:09:42.873
Now prithee, put your cell phones
on vibrate and make haste,

00:09:43.624 --> 00:09:49.171
for you are about to travel back in time
to the year of our Lord 1625,

00:09:49.255 --> 00:09:52.258
to Jericho's first pilgrim settlement.

00:09:59.223 --> 00:10:00.057
Yonder.

00:10:00.141 --> 00:10:02.476
Behold, the meeting house.

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:05.271
Inside is a collection of artifacts

00:10:05.354 --> 00:10:09.066
related to Jericho's most beloved
and pious founder,

00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:10.568
Joseph Crackstone.

00:10:11.068 --> 00:10:15.740
And beyond is our privy,
America's first gender-neutral restroom.

00:10:15.823 --> 00:10:17.158
I haveth a query.

00:10:17.241 --> 00:10:18.701
Pray, be quick, child.

00:10:18.784 --> 00:10:20.036
In the meeting house,

00:10:20.119 --> 00:10:22.288
which of Joseph Crackstone's artifacts
are on display?

00:10:22.371 --> 00:10:24.290
It is truly a treasure trove,

00:10:24.373 --> 00:10:29.503
including original farm tools, tableware,
even the Crackstone family chamber pot.

00:10:29.587 --> 00:10:32.256
Sounds fascinating.
I volunteer to work in there.

00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:34.967
Pray, no. That exhibit is being renovated.

00:10:35.051 --> 00:10:40.473
Today, thou will all be working
at the beating heart of Pilgrim World.

00:10:41.098 --> 00:10:42.683
Ye olde fudgery!

00:10:44.101 --> 00:10:46.020
"Ye Olde Fudgery?"

00:10:46.103 --> 00:10:47.980
More like ye olde diabetes in a box.

00:10:48.064 --> 00:10:50.483
Volunteers, prick up thine ears.

00:10:51.567 --> 00:10:55.404
Fudge is the lifeblood
of our humble community.

00:10:55.488 --> 00:10:57.281
And samples equal sales,

00:10:57.365 --> 00:11:03.079
so grab a uniform and a box
and make our forefathers proud.

00:11:03.663 --> 00:11:05.289
Are these for muzzling tourists?

00:11:15.883 --> 00:11:18.803
-I'm pretty sure it's dead.

00:11:18.886 --> 00:11:20.930
See the tire treads across its tail?

00:11:21.013 --> 00:11:24.058
Local artist scooped that fella up
right here on Route 22.

00:11:24.141 --> 00:11:27.520
You're telling me someone
actually goes out and collects roadkill

00:11:27.603 --> 00:11:28.938
and turns them into that?

00:11:29.689 --> 00:11:30.898
Can't keep them on the shelves.

00:11:30.981 --> 00:11:33.359
Got a whole section
dedicated to these beauties.

00:11:33.442 --> 00:11:35.152
Squirrels, skunks, snakes,

00:11:35.236 --> 00:11:36.612
and my personal fave…

00:11:39.281 --> 00:11:41.158
family of ferrets at a clambake.

00:11:42.159 --> 00:11:43.119
Too cute.

00:11:43.202 --> 00:11:45.079
You two want to make yourself useful?

00:11:45.162 --> 00:11:48.124
I reckon they could use
a good brush with a Tangle Teezer.

00:11:48.207 --> 00:11:49.208
It freshens up the fur.

00:11:51.377 --> 00:11:53.504
Maybe we can do that after, like, a…

00:11:53.587 --> 00:11:55.005
An extended coffee break.

00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:56.799
Right, Ajax?

00:11:57.800 --> 00:12:02.388
Uh, yeah. We'll hit the Weathervane.
Want us to pick you up something?

00:12:03.431 --> 00:12:06.058
No need to pay
for that overpriced hipster swill.

00:12:06.559 --> 00:12:07.768
I'm brewing chaga.

00:12:09.145 --> 00:12:10.229
It's my own blend.

00:12:11.397 --> 00:12:12.356
Mushroom tea.

00:12:13.107 --> 00:12:15.192
I foraged the little buggers myself.

00:12:15.276 --> 00:12:17.820
Better get teasing. You're in for a treat.

00:12:23.242 --> 00:12:24.326
Okay.

00:12:24.410 --> 00:12:25.411
This is good.

00:12:25.494 --> 00:12:26.787
-Delicious.
-You're welcome.

00:12:26.871 --> 00:12:30.708
Enjoy your "authentic"
pilgrim fudge made with cacao beans

00:12:30.791 --> 00:12:33.419
procured by the oppressed
indigenous people of the Amazon.

00:12:33.502 --> 00:12:34.462
What?

00:12:34.545 --> 00:12:40.468
All proceeds go to uphold this pathetic
whitewashing of American history.

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:45.139
Also, fudge wasn't invented
for another 258 years.

00:12:46.474 --> 00:12:47.850
Any takers?

00:12:48.434 --> 00:12:49.769
No, no, no.

00:13:01.947 --> 00:13:02.948
Ugh.

00:13:09.038 --> 00:13:10.790
Check out this greedy little freak.

00:13:11.373 --> 00:13:13.250
Please, I need to get back to the…

00:13:20.716 --> 00:13:21.759
Whoa, yuck!

00:13:21.842 --> 00:13:22.843
Yuck, man.

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:24.136
Come here!

00:13:26.555 --> 00:13:27.640
Get in there!

00:13:28.933 --> 00:13:29.934
Howdy, Pilgrims.

00:13:33.813 --> 00:13:36.315
-Let him go.
-You want to end up in the stocks too?

00:13:36.398 --> 00:13:39.318
Remember what happened
the last time we did this dance?

00:13:46.826 --> 00:13:47.743
Get her!

00:13:58.128 --> 00:13:59.797
Are you two still here?

00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:02.091
I can't get into more trouble with my dad.

00:14:03.008 --> 00:14:04.426
No, wait!

00:14:05.177 --> 00:14:06.136
Lucas.

00:14:08.013 --> 00:14:09.306
Let's get you cleaned up.

00:14:15.312 --> 00:14:16.438
Principal Weems.

00:14:16.939 --> 00:14:20.401
Well, it looks like another
successful Outreach Day is upon us.

00:14:22.236 --> 00:14:23.362
And, uh…

00:14:23.445 --> 00:14:27.658
thank you for your generous donation
to my re-election campaign.

00:14:28.993 --> 00:14:33.247
Consider it a token
of our ongoing cooperation.

00:14:36.458 --> 00:14:39.086
Apparently everyone
is off to their assignments.

00:14:39.169 --> 00:14:40.838
And so far no incidents.

00:14:41.714 --> 00:14:45.009
Mayor Walker,
I'd like you to meet Marilyn Thornhill.

00:14:45.092 --> 00:14:49.513
In the spirit of outreach,
she's Nevermore's first normie teacher.

00:14:49.597 --> 00:14:52.349
Well, the pleasure is all mine.

00:14:53.601 --> 00:14:55.728
Hey, have we, uh… Have we met before?

00:14:56.312 --> 00:14:58.898
Not officially,
but I see you in here every morning.

00:14:59.481 --> 00:15:03.527
You're always tucked into that back booth
when I come for my daily matcha latte.

00:15:03.611 --> 00:15:04.904
I knew it!

00:15:04.987 --> 00:15:06.906
Miss Thornhill, please keep me posted,

00:15:06.989 --> 00:15:10.618
especially about
a certain pig-tailed upstart.

00:15:11.911 --> 00:15:12.745
Right.

00:15:18.292 --> 00:15:20.419
Nobody's ever stood up for me before.

00:15:21.170 --> 00:15:22.671
You said Hummers stick together.

00:15:22.755 --> 00:15:25.341
I know this might come as a shock,

00:15:25.424 --> 00:15:27.551
but I don't have any friends.

00:15:31.555 --> 00:15:32.973
You remind me of my brother,

00:15:33.724 --> 00:15:36.393
sans the desire to strangle him
every waking moment.

00:15:38.729 --> 00:15:39.563
Now follow me.

00:15:39.647 --> 00:15:42.107
I need to know more about this Crackstone.

00:15:42.191 --> 00:15:43.984
We have a meeting house to break into.

00:15:49.657 --> 00:15:52.618
-Give me your retainer.
-What? Why? Your teeth are really good.

00:15:52.701 --> 00:15:54.828
Not as straight or white as Enid's, but--

00:15:54.912 --> 00:15:55.746
Hand it over!

00:15:57.623 --> 00:15:59.500
What if Mistress Arlene catches us?

00:15:59.583 --> 00:16:01.543
Hive code, deny everything.

00:16:01.627 --> 00:16:03.253
That's not hive code!

00:16:03.337 --> 00:16:04.838
What's the big deal anyway?

00:16:04.922 --> 00:16:07.466
The fudge is definitely
the best thing about this place.

00:16:07.549 --> 00:16:09.093
Stop talking. Keep watch.

00:16:18.394 --> 00:16:21.855
<i>My grandmother once told me</i>
<i>secrets are like zombies…</i>

00:16:23.899 --> 00:16:25.109
<i>they never truly die.</i>

00:16:27.695 --> 00:16:30.322
<i>I'm not sure what secret</i>
<i>Crackstone is hiding,</i>

00:16:30.823 --> 00:16:34.410
<i>but I have a strange feeling</i>
<i>the answers to my future lie in the past.</i>

00:16:41.291 --> 00:16:44.003
<i>The Old Meeting House, </i>1625.

00:16:55.305 --> 00:16:57.474
Thing, this is the girl from my vision.

00:16:58.851 --> 00:17:00.477
She's even holding the same book.

00:17:01.061 --> 00:17:03.522
That black one she had
outside Crackstone's crypt.

00:17:11.363 --> 00:17:12.573
How now.

00:17:12.656 --> 00:17:14.116
Your Nevermore sister,

00:17:14.199 --> 00:17:16.493
the one with the dark eyes
and the sour face,

00:17:16.577 --> 00:17:17.745
where has she hithered?

00:17:17.828 --> 00:17:19.496
You mean Wednesday Addams?

00:17:19.997 --> 00:17:23.500
Knowing her,
she's hithered somewhere she shan't be.

00:17:32.051 --> 00:17:33.177
This is the book!

00:17:38.974 --> 00:17:40.768
<i>Codex Umbrarum.</i>

00:17:40.851 --> 00:17:42.770
That's Latin for "Book of Shadows."

00:17:45.647 --> 00:17:47.775
Great. It's a fake.

00:17:50.152 --> 00:17:53.363
I don't know who Etsy is,
but I doubt she was an outcast settler.

00:17:55.741 --> 00:17:58.327
Just what the fudge
are you doing in here, missy?

00:17:58.410 --> 00:18:00.204
Mistress Arlene. How now?

00:18:00.287 --> 00:18:01.747
How now, indeed.

00:18:01.830 --> 00:18:04.374
I proclaimed the meeting house
is under repair.

00:18:04.458 --> 00:18:06.376
I know thoust heard me.

00:18:06.460 --> 00:18:08.087
I told her the door was unlocked

00:18:08.170 --> 00:18:10.339
and you were dying
to learn more about Crackstone.

00:18:10.422 --> 00:18:13.175
Yes, and this display case
was already open.

00:18:14.510 --> 00:18:16.428
-That book's a replica.
-You don't say.

00:18:16.512 --> 00:18:19.348
The original was stolen last month
during the two o'clock witch trial.

00:18:19.431 --> 00:18:22.309
It was probably
the only authentic thing you have in here,

00:18:22.392 --> 00:18:24.311
yet you still charge $29.95 a ticket?

00:18:24.394 --> 00:18:25.771
Hold thy tongue.

00:18:27.106 --> 00:18:28.440
I'm reassigning you both.

00:18:28.941 --> 00:18:30.317
To fudge-churning duty.

00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:34.863
The original meeting house,
the one in that painting, where is it?

00:18:37.241 --> 00:18:38.826
How the hell should I know?

00:18:38.909 --> 00:18:41.328
I only moved here
from Scottsdale in April.

00:18:52.422 --> 00:18:53.507
Can I help you?

00:19:06.270 --> 00:19:08.814
Ooh. That gives me the heebie-jeebies.

00:19:09.857 --> 00:19:10.858
I don't know.

00:19:11.525 --> 00:19:14.278
You think squirrels and rats
could ever work out?

00:19:14.778 --> 00:19:17.531
I mean,
they're two totally different species.

00:19:18.615 --> 00:19:19.867
Oh, yeah.

00:19:19.950 --> 00:19:20.909
I mean, totally.

00:19:21.702 --> 00:19:22.703
Why not?

00:19:22.786 --> 00:19:24.788
They have more in common than you think.

00:19:24.872 --> 00:19:28.167
Most people are scared of them,
so it would just be us… them…

00:19:28.250 --> 00:19:29.376
against the world.

00:19:30.252 --> 00:19:31.753
Wow.

00:19:31.837 --> 00:19:33.422
That was… deep.

00:19:35.591 --> 00:19:36.884
You know, by the way,

00:19:36.967 --> 00:19:40.304
I totally dug the way you scratched out
the bottom of our boat at Poe Cup.

00:19:40.387 --> 00:19:41.638
It was pretty badass.

00:19:42.222 --> 00:19:44.725
Thanks. You're not mad you lost?

00:19:45.309 --> 00:19:47.019
I was just doing a solid for Xavier.

00:19:47.102 --> 00:19:49.646
I mean, he's my boy,
but he's super competitive.

00:19:49.730 --> 00:19:51.356
Seems so laid-back.

00:19:51.940 --> 00:19:54.193
Bro's got a darker side
most people don't see.

00:19:54.693 --> 00:19:57.654
I think it's because his dad is…
well, you know, famous.

00:19:58.530 --> 00:19:59.823
All that pressure.

00:20:00.949 --> 00:20:04.536
You realize this is, like,
the longest conversation we've ever had?

00:20:07.915 --> 00:20:09.917
Gorgons are taught not to engage.

00:20:11.251 --> 00:20:13.879
You know, I don't want
to accidentally stone someone.

00:20:17.257 --> 00:20:19.218
I'm not afraid of being stoned by you.

00:20:19.301 --> 00:20:20.844
It's just temporary.

00:20:21.762 --> 00:20:22.846
Really?

00:20:24.514 --> 00:20:25.557
You mean that?

00:20:25.641 --> 00:20:26.683
One hundo!

00:20:28.060 --> 00:20:31.313
So, um, I was thinking of sneaking
behind the greenhouse tonight.

00:20:31.897 --> 00:20:33.273
Supposed to be a blue moon.

00:20:33.357 --> 00:20:36.235
Only happens once every 23 years
or something crazy.

00:20:36.735 --> 00:20:38.904
Should get a killer view from there.

00:20:39.488 --> 00:20:41.365
Cool. Hey, have fun.

00:20:42.741 --> 00:20:45.619
You know that's where
a lot of kids go to hook up, right?

00:20:45.702 --> 00:20:47.621
-I mean, it could get awkward.
-Ajax!

00:20:47.704 --> 00:20:51.500
I just spent all morning flirting
and hinting and trying to act cute

00:20:51.583 --> 00:20:54.419
while brushing some roadkill
just so you would ask me on a date.

00:20:55.796 --> 00:20:57.339
Oh!

00:20:57.422 --> 00:20:59.383
Oh! That's what you were doing.

00:21:00.175 --> 00:21:03.595
I kind of wondered when you spent
so long brushing that opossum's tail.

00:21:05.305 --> 00:21:09.851
Hey, so you want to meet up
behind the greenhouse tonight?

00:21:09.935 --> 00:21:10.769
Yes.

00:21:11.728 --> 00:21:12.896
Yes, I do.

00:21:13.605 --> 00:21:17.985
Ajax, can you help me move
the badger dentist to the front window?

00:21:18.068 --> 00:21:20.696
Yes! I can't believe he asked.

00:21:28.203 --> 00:21:31.206
I thought you were
supposed to be at Pilgrim World.

00:21:31.290 --> 00:21:33.625
I deserted it
while my sanity was still intact.

00:21:33.709 --> 00:21:34.626
Oh yeah?

00:21:35.544 --> 00:21:36.837
You want a coffee?

00:21:36.920 --> 00:21:39.715
It's one of the many perks
of this wonderful assignment.

00:21:39.798 --> 00:21:40.924
I'm actually here for Tyler.

00:21:43.510 --> 00:21:44.553
I told you he was bad news.

00:21:44.636 --> 00:21:45.637
Twice.

00:21:46.138 --> 00:21:48.181
But who I speak to is my business.

00:21:53.770 --> 00:21:54.730
You rang?

00:21:59.901 --> 00:22:00.819
Want the usual?

00:22:00.902 --> 00:22:01.862
And some help.

00:22:02.946 --> 00:22:06.575
You know the original pilgrim
meeting house, the one from the 1600s?

00:22:07.242 --> 00:22:08.702
You know if it's still around?

00:22:08.785 --> 00:22:12.205
What's left is out in Cobham Woods,
but it's pretty much a ruin.

00:22:12.789 --> 00:22:13.790
Show me.

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:16.209
Uh…

00:22:16.293 --> 00:22:19.046
There, but, look, it's kind of sketchy.

00:22:20.130 --> 00:22:22.299
Squatters and meth heads
use that place as a crash pad.

00:22:22.382 --> 00:22:24.676
My dad has it cleared out
every couple weeks.

00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:25.761
What's this about?

00:22:26.511 --> 00:22:27.346
Nothing.

00:22:29.264 --> 00:22:31.767
You're becoming obsessed
with this monster in the woods thing.

00:22:31.850 --> 00:22:35.437
Would you rather I develop
an obsession with horses and boy bands?

00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:36.563
Thank you for the help.

00:22:38.023 --> 00:22:41.777
Hey, listen, the ruins
are kind of tricky to find.

00:22:41.860 --> 00:22:44.321
I could take you this afternoon.
My shift ends at 2:00.

00:22:44.404 --> 00:22:46.531
Principal Weems would hang,
draw and quarter me

00:22:46.615 --> 00:22:48.450
if I miss the big statue dedication.

00:22:48.950 --> 00:22:51.870
And as enticing as that sounds,
I'd prefer to keep a low profile.

00:22:51.953 --> 00:22:54.498
Besides, I know my way
around the great outdoors.

00:22:54.581 --> 00:22:56.500
Don't tell me you were a Girl Scout.

00:22:56.583 --> 00:22:58.835
I could eat Girl Scouts for breakfast.

00:22:59.544 --> 00:23:01.213
I have an uncle
who went to prison for that.

00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:34.746
I was expecting more too.

00:23:37.958 --> 00:23:39.793
Who you talking to, little girl?

00:23:41.795 --> 00:23:43.880
Use "little" and "girl"
to address me again

00:23:43.964 --> 00:23:45.882
and I can't guarantee your safety.

00:23:45.966 --> 00:23:47.926
This is my place. Get out!

00:23:48.009 --> 00:23:49.219
Thing, a hand here?

00:23:56.309 --> 00:23:57.185
Hey!

00:24:04.192 --> 00:24:05.068
Hey!

00:24:05.652 --> 00:24:07.696
Get off! Get off me!

00:24:14.202 --> 00:24:15.454
There's nothing here.

00:24:19.124 --> 00:24:21.084
No, I can't just touch something.

00:24:21.626 --> 00:24:24.004
My visions seem to happen spontaneously.

00:24:26.465 --> 00:24:29.426
I would rather dye my hair pink
than ask my mother for advice.

00:24:31.595 --> 00:24:33.680
Oh, you want me to prove it to you?

00:24:34.973 --> 00:24:35.849
No.

00:24:39.603 --> 00:24:40.562
Nothing.

00:24:41.146 --> 00:24:43.565
Ah, I bet this will give us
some real insight.

00:24:49.863 --> 00:24:52.324
My visions are about
as predictable as shark attacks.

00:25:02.042 --> 00:25:04.252
Burn her!

00:25:04.336 --> 00:25:05.629
Burn her!

00:25:05.712 --> 00:25:07.672
Burn her!

00:25:07.756 --> 00:25:08.882
Burn her!

00:25:08.965 --> 00:25:10.008
Devil spawn!

00:25:12.594 --> 00:25:14.179
Devil spawn!

00:25:15.514 --> 00:25:16.556
Beast!

00:25:18.892 --> 00:25:19.726
Witch!

00:25:21.561 --> 00:25:22.729
Repent!

00:25:25.899 --> 00:25:26.775
Begone!

00:25:26.858 --> 00:25:28.735
-Witch!
-Stand aside!

00:25:30.529 --> 00:25:32.030
Goody Addams!

00:25:33.281 --> 00:25:36.576
You have been judged
before God and found guilty.

00:25:37.911 --> 00:25:39.204
You are a witch,

00:25:39.287 --> 00:25:40.539
a sorceress,

00:25:41.289 --> 00:25:43.708
Lucifer's mistress herself.

00:25:44.459 --> 00:25:46.253
For your sins,

00:25:46.336 --> 00:25:48.505
you will burn this night,

00:25:48.588 --> 00:25:51.716
and suffer the flames of eternal hellfire.

00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:53.093
I am innocent.

00:25:53.677 --> 00:25:55.971
It is you, Joseph Crackstone,
that should be tried.

00:25:56.763 --> 00:25:58.056
We were here before you,

00:25:58.765 --> 00:26:01.226
living in harmony
with nature and the native folk.

00:26:01.309 --> 00:26:03.061
But you have stolen our land.

00:26:03.645 --> 00:26:07.232
You have slaughtered the innocent.
You have robbed us of our peaceful spirit.

00:26:08.858 --> 00:26:11.653
You are the true monster. All of you!

00:26:15.031 --> 00:26:16.241
Punish her!

00:26:18.243 --> 00:26:20.203
The Devil ne'er sent such a demon.

00:26:22.914 --> 00:26:25.041
And I will send you back!

00:26:25.125 --> 00:26:26.167
No!

00:26:34.634 --> 00:26:37.554
You are abominations in the Devil's grip!

00:26:38.430 --> 00:26:41.641
I will not stop
till I have expunged this New World

00:26:41.725 --> 00:26:43.727
of every outcast.

00:26:43.810 --> 00:26:45.895
Godless creatures!

00:27:02.746 --> 00:27:04.706
Set it ablaze!

00:27:20.472 --> 00:27:21.514
Mother!

00:27:22.307 --> 00:27:23.141
Mother.

00:27:28.188 --> 00:27:29.356
There's no time, child.

00:27:31.399 --> 00:27:33.068
Leave me. Save yourself.

00:27:33.151 --> 00:27:35.278
He's chained us all to the floor.

00:27:42.243 --> 00:27:44.120
I shan't leave without you.

00:27:45.080 --> 00:27:46.915
Run. Avenge us.

00:27:47.582 --> 00:27:50.502
Find the others
and save our future.

00:27:51.086 --> 00:27:53.672
Please. My sweet lamb.

00:27:53.755 --> 00:27:56.508
Run. Run as fast as you can.

00:27:56.591 --> 00:27:58.385
You are our only hope.

00:28:33.253 --> 00:28:35.672
He won't stop until he's killed us all!

00:28:37.090 --> 00:28:37.966
He's here.

00:28:41.261 --> 00:28:43.263
There will be no escape for you.

00:28:48.143 --> 00:28:49.602
Thing, I saw her!

00:28:49.686 --> 00:28:51.187
The girl from my visions.

00:28:52.355 --> 00:28:53.857
Her name is Goody Addams,

00:28:54.733 --> 00:28:57.694
and I believe she's my ancestor
from 400 years ago.

00:29:15.170 --> 00:29:16.838
Must've been the bearded man from earlier.

00:29:24.387 --> 00:29:25.722
Come on! Come on!

00:29:45.492 --> 00:29:47.160
The monster's human.

00:29:48.453 --> 00:29:49.996
What the hell are you doing?

00:29:51.247 --> 00:29:53.458
-I was following the monster.
-You saw it?

00:29:54.083 --> 00:29:56.294
It's here? Do you have
a death wish or something?

00:29:57.295 --> 00:29:58.505
What are you doing here?

00:29:58.588 --> 00:30:01.382
I overheard you say you were
checking out the old meeting house.

00:30:01.466 --> 00:30:03.051
It's lucky I showed up when I did.

00:30:03.635 --> 00:30:04.969
I did learn one thing.

00:30:05.595 --> 00:30:06.971
The monster is human.

00:30:07.597 --> 00:30:09.974
Its tracks turned from monster prints
to human ones.

00:30:10.809 --> 00:30:12.185
Show me.

00:30:18.566 --> 00:30:20.276
The rain washed them all away.

00:30:22.654 --> 00:30:23.780
I know what I saw.

00:30:23.863 --> 00:30:26.115
-I'm trying to keep an open mind.
-How big of you.

00:30:26.199 --> 00:30:27.909
I do think you might be right about Rowan.

00:30:27.992 --> 00:30:30.787
-Why the sudden change of heart?

00:30:31.287 --> 00:30:35.083
I texted him again today. I said
maybe we could meet over spring break

00:30:35.166 --> 00:30:37.293
and go snowboarding like we did last year.

00:30:38.086 --> 00:30:41.506
This time he texted right back,
said he wouldn't be able to make it.

00:30:41.589 --> 00:30:43.967
Only you never went
snowboarding last year.

00:30:45.510 --> 00:30:47.804
Part of me wanted
to blame his recent weirdness.

00:30:48.304 --> 00:30:50.390
I didn't want to think
something bad had happened.

00:30:50.473 --> 00:30:52.934
The cover-up is
always worse than the crime.

00:30:53.017 --> 00:30:54.727
Now I need you to be honest with me.

00:30:55.770 --> 00:30:58.231
Why'd you come out to
the old meeting house in the first place?

00:30:58.982 --> 00:31:01.150
I was trying to learn more
about Crackstone.

00:31:01.901 --> 00:31:03.695
Figure out how he's connected to this.

00:31:04.279 --> 00:31:07.323
Yeah, you were trying to use
your psychic abilities, right?

00:31:07.407 --> 00:31:09.075
What makes you think I have any?

00:31:10.034 --> 00:31:12.161
Lucky guess. When did they start?

00:31:13.288 --> 00:31:14.664
About a year ago.

00:31:16.583 --> 00:31:19.210
When they happen,
it feels like I'm touching live wire.

00:31:20.253 --> 00:31:22.088
I usually enjoy that sensation.

00:31:23.131 --> 00:31:25.758
Yeah, but you can't control it
and that freaks you out.

00:31:26.676 --> 00:31:27.802
My dad's a psychic.

00:31:28.303 --> 00:31:29.137
Vincent Thorpe.

00:31:29.971 --> 00:31:31.890
My brother's his number one fan.

00:31:31.973 --> 00:31:33.808
Watched his Vegas Special so many times

00:31:33.892 --> 00:31:36.394
I'm surprised it's not
imprinted on his eyeballs.

00:31:37.478 --> 00:31:39.522
So I've lived with
a self-described master.

00:31:39.606 --> 00:31:42.859
The first thing he'll tell you
is that visions can't be trusted.

00:31:42.942 --> 00:31:44.444
They only show one part of the picture.

00:31:44.527 --> 00:31:47.739
I saw Joseph Crackstone in front of me
as clearly as I'm seeing you now.

00:31:48.656 --> 00:31:50.658
He gathered all the outcasts
in the meeting house

00:31:50.742 --> 00:31:51.993
and burned them alive.

00:31:52.076 --> 00:31:53.703
Okay, he was a sadistic asshole.

00:31:54.579 --> 00:31:57.040
It was 400 years ago.
It's got nothing to do with now.

00:31:57.123 --> 00:31:58.333
But what if it does?

00:31:59.167 --> 00:32:02.712
You saw Rowan's drawing.
Crackstone was standing in the quad.

00:32:02.795 --> 00:32:05.965
You're creating a story in your head
and using visions to back it up.

00:32:06.049 --> 00:32:09.218
-They're telling you what you want to see.
-Are you mansplaining my power?

00:32:10.637 --> 00:32:12.847
All I'm saying is my dad, the expert,

00:32:12.931 --> 00:32:15.808
would warn you that psychic ability
isn't rooted in logic.

00:32:16.601 --> 00:32:17.977
It's triggered by emotions.

00:32:19.187 --> 00:32:21.981
And let's be honest,
emotion isn't your strong suit.

00:32:25.568 --> 00:32:27.153
I believe Rowan was right.

00:32:28.279 --> 00:32:31.240
Something bad is going to happen,
and I need to stop it.

00:32:31.324 --> 00:32:32.909
Starting with that monster.

00:32:34.410 --> 00:32:35.411
Whoever it is.

00:32:44.003 --> 00:32:45.672
<i>I thought nothing scared me,</i>

00:32:46.172 --> 00:32:49.634
<i>but that was before I stared</i>
<i>into the eyes of Joseph Crackstone.</i>

00:32:53.721 --> 00:32:57.517
<i>I don't believe in heaven or hell.</i>
<i>But I do believe in revenge.</i>

00:32:58.977 --> 00:33:01.437
<i>I usually serve it warm</i>
<i>with a side of pain,</i>

00:33:01.521 --> 00:33:04.107
<i>but I've never faced</i>
<i>an adversary cast in bronze.</i>

00:33:20.039 --> 00:33:21.332
Thank you.

00:33:21.416 --> 00:33:25.128
It is my honor
to celebrate our town's history

00:33:25.211 --> 00:33:29.549
and Jericho's noble forefather,
Joseph Crackstone.

00:33:30.341 --> 00:33:33.845
Now, he believed that
with a happy heart and an open ear,

00:33:33.928 --> 00:33:36.597
there was nothing
our town couldn't achieve.

00:33:36.681 --> 00:33:42.937
So together as one, our community
and our friends at Nevermore Academy,

00:33:43.021 --> 00:33:46.149
we've built a monument
to celebrate his memory.

00:33:46.232 --> 00:33:51.696
Now, may the spirit of Joseph Crackstone
be memorialized for eternity.

00:35:43.182 --> 00:35:44.767
That was a disaster.

00:35:44.851 --> 00:35:46.435
The mayor is furious!

00:35:46.519 --> 00:35:50.189
I've lost count of the angry phone calls,
emails, and people in the town,

00:35:50.273 --> 00:35:51.440
alumni and parents.

00:35:51.524 --> 00:35:53.526
They want answers and so do I.

00:35:53.609 --> 00:35:55.111
I would lead the inquisition,

00:35:55.194 --> 00:35:56.904
but I left my thumbscrews
and rack at home.

00:35:58.114 --> 00:36:01.576
Miss Addams… you're already on thin ice.

00:36:01.659 --> 00:36:03.244
Wafer-thin ice.

00:36:03.327 --> 00:36:05.663
I swear on my late scorpion's soul,

00:36:06.247 --> 00:36:07.456
my hands are clean.

00:36:18.050 --> 00:36:20.928
I may not have hard evidence,
but I see you.

00:36:21.762 --> 00:36:23.598
You're a trouble magnet.

00:36:23.681 --> 00:36:25.892
If trouble means standing up to lies,

00:36:25.975 --> 00:36:27.727
decades of discrimination,

00:36:27.810 --> 00:36:31.981
centuries of treating outcasts
like second-class citizens or worse…

00:36:32.064 --> 00:36:33.816
-What are you talking about?
-Jericho.

00:36:33.900 --> 00:36:36.360
Why does this town
even have an Outreach Day?

00:36:36.444 --> 00:36:38.696
Don't you know
its real history with outcasts?

00:36:38.779 --> 00:36:41.032
The actual story of Joseph Crackstone?

00:36:43.159 --> 00:36:44.160
I do.

00:36:44.660 --> 00:36:47.872
-To an extent.
-Then why be complicit in its cover up?

00:36:47.955 --> 00:36:50.374
Those who forget history
are doomed to repeat it.

00:36:52.376 --> 00:36:53.878
That's where you and I differ.

00:36:54.921 --> 00:36:56.380
Where you see doom,

00:36:56.964 --> 00:36:58.758
I see opportunity.

00:36:58.841 --> 00:37:01.093
Maybe this is a chance
to rewrite the wrongs,

00:37:01.177 --> 00:37:04.639
to start a new chapter
in the normie-outcast relations.

00:37:04.722 --> 00:37:07.600
Nothing has changed
since Crackstone. They still hate us.

00:37:08.559 --> 00:37:11.270
Only now they sugarcoat it
with platitudes and smiles.

00:37:12.313 --> 00:37:16.108
-If you're unwilling to fight for truth--
-You don't think I want the truth?

00:37:16.192 --> 00:37:17.360
Of course I do.

00:37:17.860 --> 00:37:19.779
But the world
isn't always black and white.

00:37:19.862 --> 00:37:21.280
There are shades of gray.

00:37:21.364 --> 00:37:22.406
Maybe for you.

00:37:23.032 --> 00:37:25.117
But it's either
they write our story or we do.

00:37:25.993 --> 00:37:27.286
You can't have it both ways.

00:37:29.664 --> 00:37:30.581
You're exhausting.

00:37:30.665 --> 00:37:31.540
I know.

00:37:37.838 --> 00:37:39.215
Goodnight, Miss Addams.

00:37:43.094 --> 00:37:44.428
But you should know…

00:37:47.098 --> 00:37:48.474
I don't tire easily.

00:38:10.830 --> 00:38:11.914
Who the hell's there?

00:38:32.393 --> 00:38:33.227
Too much?

00:38:34.603 --> 00:38:37.440
I feel like
you just napalmed me, Enid.

00:38:37.523 --> 00:38:40.151
So glad I have my date with Ajax tonight.

00:38:40.234 --> 00:38:42.611
Get my mind off that trainwreck
of an afternoon.

00:38:42.695 --> 00:38:46.365
I literally think I have PTSD.
I didn't even get to do my dance routine.

00:38:46.449 --> 00:38:47.783
What a tragedy.

00:38:47.867 --> 00:38:51.829
What kind of twisted psycho would want
to sabotage such a life-affirming event?

00:38:53.664 --> 00:38:54.665
You're going to be late.

00:38:57.835 --> 00:38:58.753
Wish me luck.

00:38:58.836 --> 00:39:00.755
If he breaks your heart,
I'll nail-gun his.

00:39:04.717 --> 00:39:07.386
<i>I don't believe</i>
<i>in mandatory volunteer work,</i>

00:39:07.470 --> 00:39:10.639
<i>sugar-coated history, or happy endings,</i>

00:39:11.682 --> 00:39:15.561
<i>but most of all…</i>
<i>I don't believe in coincidences.</i>

00:39:46.133 --> 00:39:48.260
<i>To paraphrase Agatha Christie,</i>

00:39:48.969 --> 00:39:51.722
<i>one coincidence is just a coincidence,</i>

00:39:52.431 --> 00:39:53.432
<i>two are a clue…</i>

00:39:54.558 --> 00:39:55.810
<i>…and three are proof.</i>

00:40:05.778 --> 00:40:06.612
No!

00:40:25.714 --> 00:40:29.135
<i>Rowan's drawing of me and Crackstone</i>
<i>happens sometime in the future.</i>

00:40:30.845 --> 00:40:34.140
<i>Goody Addams' warnings</i>
<i>about Crackstone were in the past.</i>

00:40:36.100 --> 00:40:38.269
<i>And the monster is here in the present.</i>

00:40:40.604 --> 00:40:43.232
<i>Three coincidences</i>
<i>that I know are connected.</i>

00:41:33.407 --> 00:41:35.493
<i>That monster could be anyone.</i>

00:41:43.375 --> 00:41:46.712
<i>The sheriff thinks they only exist</i>
<i>behind the walls of this school.</i>

00:41:52.301 --> 00:41:55.221
<i>The truth is,</i>
<i>there are monsters everywhere.</i>

00:42:02.728 --> 00:42:07.566
<i>And sometimes the monsters we least</i>
<i>suspect are the most dangerous.</i>

00:42:12.321 --> 00:42:14.823
<i>They don't need teeth</i>
<i>and claws to terrify.</i>

00:42:16.742 --> 00:42:19.578
<i>They hide in the shadows</i>
<i>until no one is looking.</i>

00:42:20.746 --> 00:42:22.206
<i>And then they strike.</i>

00:42:29.129 --> 00:42:30.673
<i>But I'm looking now.</i>

00:42:32.925 --> 00:42:35.511
<i>And I won't stop until I find the truth.</i>
