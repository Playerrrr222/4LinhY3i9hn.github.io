00:00:05.047 --> 00:00:07.049
(Lively news theme)

00:00:07.966 --> 00:00:09.134
Hello, I'm Randall park.

00:00:09.218 --> 00:00:12.179
With election day 2032
just around the corner,

00:00:12.262 --> 00:00:14.139
the latest polls released today

00:00:14.223 --> 00:00:15.641
show candidate Dwayne Johnson

00:00:15.724 --> 00:00:17.184
with a four point lead

00:00:17.267 --> 00:00:19.353
over his opponent,
senator Brayden taft.

00:00:19.436 --> 00:00:21.438
Candidate Johnson
has come along way

00:00:21.522 --> 00:00:23.357
since we started
our all-access coverage

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:24.441
of his campaign.

00:00:24.733 --> 00:00:25.901
We've captured the good,

00:00:26.401 --> 00:00:28.445
the bad, and the surreal.

00:00:28.862 --> 00:00:30.405
(Sin gin g) Starts tumbling

00:00:30.489 --> 00:00:33.784
who's your daddy?
Who's your baby?

00:00:34.076 --> 00:00:38.497
Who's your buddy?
Who's your man?

00:00:38.872 --> 00:00:40.541
See you at the polls!
Let's do this!

00:00:40.624 --> 00:00:42.251
(Crowd cheering)

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:45.087
Tonight we have candidate
Johnson with us live

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:47.089
from his campaign
headquarters. Welcome, Dwayne.

00:00:47.923 --> 00:00:50.300
Hey, Randall, it's good to
see you, buddy, as always.

00:00:50.384 --> 00:00:52.584
Tell me, are you already
writing your acceptance speech?

00:00:52.636 --> 00:00:54.555
(Laughs) Randall, you know me.

00:00:54.638 --> 00:00:56.014
I never point to that scoreboard

00:00:56.098 --> 00:00:57.099
until the game is over.

00:00:57.182 --> 00:00:58.451
Oh, yeah, you see,
I'm the opposite.

00:00:58.475 --> 00:00:59.726
I love counting my chickens.

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:02.145
I, like, literally
have four chickens.

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:03.397
You live free, man.

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:04.523
Okay.

00:01:04.773 --> 00:01:06.650
Randall, there's been
so many times in my life

00:01:06.733 --> 00:01:09.695
where things were going great,
and then all of a sudden, bam,

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:11.071
I get blindsided.

00:01:11.154 --> 00:01:13.634
The poster looks great, mom,
but rocky hasn't won the belt yet.

00:01:13.699 --> 00:01:15.909
I had these made early.
Vince told me that

00:01:15.993 --> 00:01:17.202
it's only a matter of time.

00:01:17.286 --> 00:01:18.745
Rocky's going to go on the road,

00:01:18.829 --> 00:01:20.747
wrestle for the wwf,

00:01:20.831 --> 00:01:22.457
become the tag-team champion,

00:01:22.541 --> 00:01:24.459
and then he'll return
home and fight for me.

00:01:24.543 --> 00:01:27.337
Oh, Dewey, uh, take a picture

00:01:27.421 --> 00:01:28.672
of me with my poster.

00:01:28.755 --> 00:01:30.441
I'm gonna take it on the
road with me tomorrow,

00:01:30.465 --> 00:01:31.466
show it to macho man,

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:32.610
tell him I'm from the future.

00:01:32.634 --> 00:01:33.719
It'll freak him out.

00:01:35.846 --> 00:01:38.432
Then I'll appear and pretend
to be you from the past.

00:01:38.765 --> 00:01:40.601
His brain is gonna explode.

00:01:40.684 --> 00:01:42.269
I appreciate that, little man,

00:01:42.352 --> 00:01:44.438
but you're gonna stay
here with your mom.

00:01:44.521 --> 00:01:45.731
Road is no place for a kid.

00:01:45.981 --> 00:01:46.982
But I'm not a kid.

00:01:47.065 --> 00:01:49.318
I'm the president of the
rocky Johnson fan club.

00:01:49.401 --> 00:01:51.153
Sweetie, we're gonna
have so much fun.

00:01:51.236 --> 00:01:53.363
We're gonna go to the zoo,
see that pregnant panda,

00:01:53.447 --> 00:01:54.507
and we're all gonna go
to the beach later.

00:01:54.531 --> 00:01:55.574
(Sighs)

00:01:55.657 --> 00:01:58.243
Hey, boss, you ready
to go visit Gary chow?

00:01:58.327 --> 00:01:59.328
Yeah.

00:01:59.411 --> 00:02:01.371
Wait, are you going
to see Greg yao?

00:02:02.914 --> 00:02:05.417
Because Gary chow sounds
suspiciously like Greg yao.

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:06.585
Gary is my florist,

00:02:06.668 --> 00:02:08.587
and we're gonna go
and talk about orchids.

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.088
See, when you smile
and say that,

00:02:10.172 --> 00:02:11.899
it makes me think you're
not telling me the truth.

00:02:11.923 --> 00:02:12.924
Does it?

00:02:13.008 --> 00:02:14.688
I think you should stay
away from that guy.

00:02:14.718 --> 00:02:17.054
If you want to put on a
match, you go through me.

00:02:17.179 --> 00:02:18.406
Just tell me what
you want me to do.

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.807
You pay my tribute
fee of $5,000.

00:02:21.808 --> 00:02:23.852
Did you hear, FBI?
Did you get it?

00:02:23.935 --> 00:02:25.562
Yeah, but if we can get more,

00:02:25.646 --> 00:02:27.886
we have a better chance of
making sure the charges stick.

00:02:28.523 --> 00:02:30.442
And, remember, we're
going to the beach later.

00:02:30.525 --> 00:02:32.611
We won't be gone
long. Come on, Bob.

00:02:32.778 --> 00:02:34.380
Young Dwayne: You need me
on the road with you. I'll get the car.

00:02:34.404 --> 00:02:35.882
Young Dwayne: Who's
gonna help sell merch?

00:02:35.906 --> 00:02:37.491
Vince has guys who do that.

00:02:37.574 --> 00:02:38.700
Not as well as I can.

00:02:38.784 --> 00:02:41.370
You see this smile?
It moves units.

00:02:41.453 --> 00:02:42.722
Dewey, I don't think
it's a good idea.

00:02:42.746 --> 00:02:44.106
I don't want to stay
here with mom.

00:02:44.206 --> 00:02:45.415
I wanna go with you.

00:02:48.377 --> 00:02:49.378
Young ata: Okay, fine.

00:02:49.461 --> 00:02:50.647
Rocky: You wanna
go somewhere with me?

00:02:50.671 --> 00:02:52.673
Okay, then. Let's go.

00:02:53.465 --> 00:02:54.549
Elbows in.

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:55.967
Yeah, back straight.

00:02:56.426 --> 00:02:57.969
(Exhales) Now.

00:02:59.179 --> 00:03:00.430
Flex.

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:02.557
Ooh.

00:03:05.143 --> 00:03:06.144
Yeah, nice.

00:03:06.228 --> 00:03:07.479
Look at that definition.

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:09.898
Me and you could be doing
this on the road, dad.

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:11.483
Gym buddies.

00:03:11.858 --> 00:03:13.902
Yeah, the gym is
a place to get after it,

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:16.029
but it's also a place
for real talk.

00:03:16.405 --> 00:03:18.031
Okay, real talk me.

00:03:19.074 --> 00:03:20.409
All right. Come here, Dewey.

00:03:20.492 --> 00:03:21.535
Remember how mom said

00:03:21.618 --> 00:03:23.537
star search changed their minds

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.660
about flying her out to los
Angeles for an audition?

00:03:26.581 --> 00:03:27.624
That wasn't true.

00:03:27.708 --> 00:03:30.502
Oh, okay. So mom's a bad singer.

00:03:30.585 --> 00:03:31.670
What? No.

00:03:31.753 --> 00:03:34.214
No, no, no, no, no.
She chose not to go

00:03:34.339 --> 00:03:36.466
to be here with you
while I was on the road.

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:38.844
She wanted to be that
constant presence in your life

00:03:38.927 --> 00:03:41.012
so you always felt
like you had a home.

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:42.806
So, when you say things like,

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:44.641
"I don't wanna stay
here with mom,"

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:46.727
Dewey, that hurts her.

00:03:46.935 --> 00:03:48.353
You're not a little kid anymore,

00:03:48.437 --> 00:03:49.730
so you can't be doing that.

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:52.190
Are you ready to be the man

00:03:52.274 --> 00:03:53.734
of the house while I'm gone?

00:03:54.818 --> 00:03:55.902
What do I have to do?

00:03:56.445 --> 00:03:58.905
Watch after your mom
and your grandma.

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:00.949
A man looks out for his family.

00:04:04.202 --> 00:04:05.787
Dad, if it's okay with you,

00:04:05.871 --> 00:04:07.456
I'm gonna do my next
set by myself.

00:04:07.956 --> 00:04:08.999
Absolutely.

00:04:09.499 --> 00:04:10.917
Dosome thinking curls.

00:04:12.294 --> 00:04:13.628
Adult Dwayne: I was just a kid

00:04:13.712 --> 00:04:16.047
but I knew I wanted
to live by those words.

00:04:16.923 --> 00:04:18.508
Words I still live by today.

00:04:18.633 --> 00:04:22.053
(Singing)
When you're getting down

00:04:24.598 --> 00:04:26.057
Lia, Bob.

00:04:26.767 --> 00:04:27.768
Come in.

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:29.728
You know why we're here, yao.

00:04:30.061 --> 00:04:31.104
Where's my tribute fee?

00:04:31.438 --> 00:04:32.981
Okay, straight to the point.

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:39.905
It's light.

00:04:39.988 --> 00:04:41.948
I... I could only find $1,800.

00:04:42.032 --> 00:04:44.284
But if you let me put
on my wrestling match,

00:04:44.367 --> 00:04:45.535
I can get you the rest.

00:04:46.161 --> 00:04:47.454
You hear that, Peter?

00:04:47.537 --> 00:04:49.372
He's trying to screw
me, high chief.

00:04:49.831 --> 00:04:51.958
I'm not. Who are you talking to?

00:04:52.375 --> 00:04:53.376
(Sputters)

00:04:53.794 --> 00:04:55.921
I... I don't have the money.

00:04:56.463 --> 00:04:58.215
Then you have to pay
a different price.

00:04:59.174 --> 00:05:00.258
What do you mean?

00:05:00.801 --> 00:05:02.052
Bang, bang.

00:05:02.886 --> 00:05:04.763
You have until
the end of the day.

00:05:10.894 --> 00:05:11.895
(Door closes)

00:05:12.187 --> 00:05:13.188
Did you get it?

00:05:13.814 --> 00:05:15.190
We got it. Calling it in now.

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:17.651
(Blows air)

00:05:18.568 --> 00:05:19.569
Where are they?

00:05:19.736 --> 00:05:21.738
Mom said to meet her
and grandma here.

00:05:22.239 --> 00:05:24.866
All: Surprise!

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:26.451
(Laughter)

00:05:28.036 --> 00:05:29.388
I just wanted to do
a little something

00:05:29.412 --> 00:05:30.732
to show you how
proud of you I am.

00:05:30.831 --> 00:05:32.040
Thank you, babe.

00:05:33.124 --> 00:05:34.543
This is just the
beginning for us.

00:05:35.794 --> 00:05:36.920
Food smells incredible.

00:05:37.003 --> 00:05:39.714
Ha! I stole recipe
from old family enemy.

00:05:40.257 --> 00:05:42.926
Hey, so, uh, me and
sika are trying to find out

00:05:43.009 --> 00:05:44.845
who's got the best
artistic eye, eh?

00:05:44.928 --> 00:05:46.568
Sika: So let us
eachtake a picture of you,

00:05:46.638 --> 00:05:49.015
and then in five to seven
days' time when it's developed,

00:05:49.099 --> 00:05:50.284
you can tell us
which one's better.

00:05:50.308 --> 00:05:51.726
But first, shirts off.

00:05:51.935 --> 00:05:53.812
Oh. Family: Oy, oy, oy, oy.

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:55.460
Afa and sika: Thank
you, Dewey. Yeah.

00:05:56.064 --> 00:05:58.608
One, two, three, flex.

00:05:58.733 --> 00:05:59.860
(Cameras flashing) Afa: Ooh.

00:05:59.943 --> 00:06:03.363
Oh, what a beautiful
tableau, yeah.

00:06:03.446 --> 00:06:04.573
Ah, Dewey.

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:07.158
Mom, can I real talk you?

00:06:07.534 --> 00:06:08.785
Sure, baby. What's going on?

00:06:11.162 --> 00:06:12.539
(Chuckles) What's that for?

00:06:12.831 --> 00:06:15.083
I'm glad I'm staying here
with you while dad's gone.

00:06:16.084 --> 00:06:17.210
I'm glad you are too.

00:06:17.878 --> 00:06:19.188
Randall: So even
at ten-years-old,

00:06:19.212 --> 00:06:21.339
you were already
stepping up for your family?

00:06:21.423 --> 00:06:22.900
Adult Dwayne: Yeah,
it's a great feeling

00:06:22.924 --> 00:06:24.402
when you're on top
of that rollercoaster,

00:06:24.426 --> 00:06:26.052
but we all know
what comes after that.

00:06:26.136 --> 00:06:27.345
Young Lia: Ooh, perfect.

00:06:27.929 --> 00:06:29.180
The cake is too nice.

00:06:29.264 --> 00:06:30.783
They'll never believe
that you made it.

00:06:30.807 --> 00:06:32.726
They'll believe what
I tell them to believe.

00:06:32.809 --> 00:06:33.935
Come on. We're late.

00:06:35.061 --> 00:06:36.229
(Tires squealing)

00:06:36.771 --> 00:06:38.064
Agent: FBI!

00:06:38.148 --> 00:06:40.609
Lia maivia, you're
under arrest for extortion.

00:06:40.692 --> 00:06:41.776
Extortion?

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:42.944
What are you talking about?

00:06:43.028 --> 00:06:44.112
I'm just a grandma.

00:06:44.195 --> 00:06:45.822
We got you threatening
Greg yao on video.

00:06:46.823 --> 00:06:48.366
You're making a big mistake.

00:06:48.617 --> 00:06:50.076
I am a lady, innocent

00:06:51.494 --> 00:06:53.038
run, boss. (Grunts)

00:06:54.331 --> 00:06:56.541
You run. I'm wearing flip-flops.

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:01.755
Man, I would not be that
cool if the feds came after me.

00:07:02.005 --> 00:07:03.298
She was cold as ice.

00:07:03.423 --> 00:07:05.842
Like sly Stallone from
cliffhanger when he had to...

00:07:05.967 --> 00:07:07.135
Burn all the stolen money...

00:07:07.218 --> 00:07:09.322
Burn all the stolen money
to stay alive... to stay alive.

00:07:09.346 --> 00:07:10.722
Yes, Randall!

00:07:11.097 --> 00:07:12.777
Yeah, it was a classic.
You got it. My man.

00:07:12.891 --> 00:07:15.560
(Clears throat)
Um, so that was it?

00:07:15.685 --> 00:07:16.770
Your grandma went to jail,

00:07:16.853 --> 00:07:18.039
and that was the end
of her business?

00:07:18.063 --> 00:07:19.898
No, she actually beat the rap.

00:07:20.148 --> 00:07:21.149
Twist.

00:07:21.358 --> 00:07:23.109
But I'll save that story
for down the road.

00:07:23.318 --> 00:07:24.903
Oh, I'm already
obsessed with it.

00:07:24.986 --> 00:07:27.238
You know, my dad would've
never known it at the time,

00:07:27.322 --> 00:07:28.782
butwhen he told me
to always look out

00:07:28.865 --> 00:07:31.284
for my grandmother and my mom,
well, I took that to heart.

00:07:31.368 --> 00:07:33.328
Even more reason why
your grandmother's arrest

00:07:33.411 --> 00:07:35.080
must've been so shocking
for all of you.

00:07:35.163 --> 00:07:37.874
Itwas, but that's what
it's like on a rollercoaster,

00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:38.959
highs and lows.

00:07:39.209 --> 00:07:40.853
You know, I remember
a similar thing happened

00:07:40.877 --> 00:07:42.003
when I was in high school.

00:07:42.087 --> 00:07:43.272
I've talked about
this in the past,

00:07:43.296 --> 00:07:45.215
where I was going
down a pretty dark road.

00:07:45.298 --> 00:07:48.009
But myjunior year, I
found the game of football,

00:07:48.551 --> 00:07:50.762
and that's when things
really started to change.

00:07:50.845 --> 00:07:52.138
I was a top recruit,

00:07:52.222 --> 00:07:54.182
and every major football
program was after me.

00:07:54.265 --> 00:07:55.642
Dewey, we got another one.

00:07:56.059 --> 00:07:57.699
Adult Dwayne: It started
with the letters.

00:07:57.936 --> 00:07:59.229
Man: (Singing) Notorious

00:07:59.354 --> 00:08:00.480
(phone ringing)

00:08:00.563 --> 00:08:01.958
Adult Dwayne: Then came
the phone calls.

00:08:01.982 --> 00:08:03.108
Hello?

00:08:03.191 --> 00:08:04.442
No, Dwayne's not home.

00:08:05.026 --> 00:08:06.111
Who's calling?

00:08:06.861 --> 00:08:08.196
(Phone ringing)

00:08:08.363 --> 00:08:09.406
(Music continues)

00:08:09.489 --> 00:08:12.075
Here's one you don't compromise

00:08:12.158 --> 00:08:13.761
adult Dwayne: Then came
the in-home visits,

00:08:13.785 --> 00:08:15.787
which weirdly always
ended up with coaches

00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:17.038
giving us a mug.

00:08:17.956 --> 00:08:19.040
Anyone want coffee?

00:08:19.124 --> 00:08:20.166
Yeah, thanks.

00:08:20.917 --> 00:08:22.002
(Faucet rumbling)

00:08:22.127 --> 00:08:23.670
Oh, this damn apartment.

00:08:24.212 --> 00:08:25.839
The landlord
never fixes anything.

00:08:26.214 --> 00:08:28.008
Sounds like Andre when
he sleeps on his back.

00:08:28.466 --> 00:08:30.152
Adult Dwayne: My family
was still struggling,

00:08:30.176 --> 00:08:31.302
but I knew college football

00:08:31.386 --> 00:08:33.304
could lead to a better
future for us.

00:08:33.388 --> 00:08:34.889
You gotta go to notre dame, man.

00:08:34.973 --> 00:08:36.599
You're automatically
down with Jesus.

00:08:36.891 --> 00:08:38.184
I like the Georgia bulldogs.

00:08:38.268 --> 00:08:40.121
Do you remember the time
you stole my dog purse?

00:08:40.145 --> 00:08:41.730
They're trying
to deport me, Dewey.

00:08:41.813 --> 00:08:44.315
The feds are the
criminals. Bob, say aloha.

00:08:44.399 --> 00:08:45.608
Aloha.

00:08:45.734 --> 00:08:47.736
If you join usc, the other
teams will be seeing red

00:08:48.987 --> 00:08:50.280
in a way that I never will.

00:08:50.363 --> 00:08:51.531
Nebraska's a no-brainer.

00:08:51.614 --> 00:08:53.616
I hear it's called
"big hair country".

00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:56.202
Don't listen to big-hair.
Nebraska's defensive scheme

00:08:56.286 --> 00:08:57.746
is all wrong for
your style of play.

00:08:58.038 --> 00:08:59.330
I appreciate the input.

00:09:00.206 --> 00:09:01.374
Can I ask you something?

00:09:01.458 --> 00:09:03.209
Oh, my god, yes, I
will go to prom with you.

00:09:04.169 --> 00:09:07.380
No, I was gonna ask why
Karen still won't talk to me.

00:09:07.464 --> 00:09:09.382
(Softly) Oh, my god.
It's fine, no one noticed.

00:09:10.717 --> 00:09:12.010
Young Dwayne: It's been a year.

00:09:12.469 --> 00:09:13.887
Do I like that you're poor? No.

00:09:14.179 --> 00:09:16.473
But I hate that you
lied to me about it.

00:09:17.474 --> 00:09:18.892
You didn't even give
me a chance.

00:09:20.894 --> 00:09:23.534
Adult Dwayne: You know, as
much as I hated Karen not talking to me,

00:09:23.563 --> 00:09:25.482
it just added fuel to
my fire to be great.

00:09:25.565 --> 00:09:27.317
Anything come from
the university of Miami?

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:29.402
No, ucla and Washington today.

00:09:29.486 --> 00:09:31.321
Hey. (Groans)

00:09:31.404 --> 00:09:33.239
(Chuckles) Typical you.

00:09:33.323 --> 00:09:35.259
You got all these schools
offering you scholarships,

00:09:35.283 --> 00:09:36.910
but you want the one that isn't.

00:09:36.993 --> 00:09:38.328
They're the national champs,

00:09:38.411 --> 00:09:39.931
and if they're not
gonna come after me,

00:09:40.497 --> 00:09:42.040
then I guess
I gotta go after them.

00:09:42.707 --> 00:09:43.792
(Phone ringing)

00:09:43.875 --> 00:09:45.001
David Scott.

00:09:45.085 --> 00:09:46.228
Young Dwayne:
What's up, David Scott?

00:09:46.252 --> 00:09:47.313
Why aren't you recruiting me?

00:09:47.337 --> 00:09:48.463
Who is this?

00:09:48.546 --> 00:09:51.800
The beast of Bethlehem,
Dwayne Johnson.

00:09:51.883 --> 00:09:54.219
Five star d-lineman,
freedom high,

00:09:54.302 --> 00:09:55.553
Bethlehem, Pennsylvania.

00:09:55.637 --> 00:09:57.514
Yeah, look, I'm not familiar...

00:09:57.597 --> 00:09:59.033
If you want to let
Bobby bowden beat you

00:09:59.057 --> 00:10:01.101
to the best d-lineman
in the country,

00:10:01.184 --> 00:10:03.186
that's up to you.
Let me look into it.

00:10:03.269 --> 00:10:05.188
Better hurry. I'm
making a decision soon.

00:10:06.064 --> 00:10:07.107
Hey, kid,

00:10:07.232 --> 00:10:09.317
I respect the guts
you got in calling me.

00:10:09.651 --> 00:10:10.819
Gotta go for it, right?

00:10:12.112 --> 00:10:13.613
Adult Dwayne:
I was feeling strong,

00:10:13.696 --> 00:10:16.366
full of confidence, and I
decided to keep it going.

00:10:16.908 --> 00:10:18.368
Andrew carnegie...
Can I help you?

00:10:18.451 --> 00:10:19.619
No thanks. I'm on a roll.

00:10:19.702 --> 00:10:20.787
I gotta keep going.

00:10:21.371 --> 00:10:23.748
Karen, will you go
to prom with me?

00:10:24.415 --> 00:10:26.126
Prom? Okay, first off,

00:10:26.209 --> 00:10:27.436
we haven't talked in,
like, a century,

00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:29.754
and second, I have
a boyfriend now, Kevin.

00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:33.466
Father, forgive him for he
knows not what he does.

00:10:33.591 --> 00:10:36.469
Father, forgive him 'cause
he's a Rudy poot candy ass.

00:10:36.553 --> 00:10:37.804
(Students laughing)

00:10:38.054 --> 00:10:39.990
Look, I shouldn't have
lied to you about being rich,

00:10:40.014 --> 00:10:41.617
and I get why you don't
want anything to do with me,

00:10:41.641 --> 00:10:43.560
but things are different
now. I've changed

00:10:43.643 --> 00:10:46.146
and in a few years, my
lie won't be a lie anymore.

00:10:46.229 --> 00:10:47.480
I'm gonna get into the NFL,

00:10:47.564 --> 00:10:50.567
and be so rich, I can afford a
robot maid like rocky balboa.

00:10:50.650 --> 00:10:51.734
What?

00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:53.546
Rocky bought one
for Paulie in rocky iv.

00:10:53.570 --> 00:10:55.238
It doesn't matter.
What I'm saying is,

00:10:55.321 --> 00:10:57.657
if you ever change
your mind, ever,

00:10:58.283 --> 00:11:00.493
come find me.
You'll know where I am.

00:11:03.246 --> 00:11:05.665
Teacher: All right,
class. Andrew carnegie.

00:11:05.790 --> 00:11:07.167
The balls.

00:11:07.250 --> 00:11:09.502
Hey, worked with Miami,
might work with Karen too.

00:11:09.586 --> 00:11:10.938
Gabe: Wait, what do
you mean, Miami?

00:11:10.962 --> 00:11:12.189
Dude, they finally
recruiting you?

00:11:12.213 --> 00:11:14.608
Should be showing up at my
place right now for an official visit.

00:11:14.632 --> 00:11:16.112
What the hell are
you doing here then?

00:11:16.342 --> 00:11:17.719
Gotta finish my workout.

00:11:18.052 --> 00:11:19.429
(Softly) The balls.

00:11:20.096 --> 00:11:22.390
(Sin gin g) Big
wheel keep on turnin'

00:11:23.099 --> 00:11:25.768
proud Mary keep on burnin'

00:11:26.769 --> 00:11:29.272
rollin ', rollin'

00:11:30.148 --> 00:11:32.275
rollin' on the river

00:11:33.109 --> 00:11:34.611
love me some John fogerty.

00:11:35.028 --> 00:11:36.446
Wish I'd brought my harmonica.

00:11:37.447 --> 00:11:38.727
Apologies for being
late, fellas.

00:11:38.907 --> 00:11:40.408
Hey, son. Where you been?

00:11:40.658 --> 00:11:42.344
Your mama been singing
creedence for an hour.

00:11:42.368 --> 00:11:44.430
"Who'll stop the rain,"
"put a candle in the window."

00:11:44.454 --> 00:11:46.706
At the gym.
I lost track of time.

00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:48.267
You know how it is
when you catch a groove.

00:11:48.291 --> 00:11:49.334
Can't cut it short.

00:11:49.417 --> 00:11:51.252
You kept us waiting for an hour

00:11:51.794 --> 00:11:53.922
because you wanted to
finish your damn workout?

00:11:58.051 --> 00:11:59.052
I kinda love it.

00:12:00.094 --> 00:12:01.304
(Bleep). Me too, man.

00:12:03.264 --> 00:12:04.766
(All laughing)

00:12:05.016 --> 00:12:06.643
I like that coach 0.

00:12:06.726 --> 00:12:09.020
He's like a mix of my
mom and macho man.

00:12:09.103 --> 00:12:11.356
Mmm, yeah, he's got
great thickness.

00:12:11.439 --> 00:12:14.108
You give me a month with him,
I'll make him a wwf champion.

00:12:14.192 --> 00:12:16.361
Any guy over 200
pounds you say this.

00:12:17.111 --> 00:12:19.155
Hey, congrats on Miami, son.

00:12:19.405 --> 00:12:21.032
You made it happen for yourself.

00:12:22.659 --> 00:12:23.952
And the first thing I'm gonna do

00:12:24.035 --> 00:12:26.287
when I get drafted to the
NFL is buy you a house.

00:12:26.371 --> 00:12:27.580
Oh. (Laughs)

00:12:27.664 --> 00:12:29.082
How about you buy us a Cadillac,

00:12:29.165 --> 00:12:30.517
and we'll work our
way up from there?

00:12:30.541 --> 00:12:32.293
No more crappy apartments.

00:12:32.377 --> 00:12:33.586
No more broken faucets.

00:12:33.670 --> 00:12:34.754
No more landlords.

00:12:35.088 --> 00:12:37.090
This is gonna be the first
house we've ever owned.

00:12:37.548 --> 00:12:38.883
I got big dreams for us.

00:12:39.509 --> 00:12:40.593
Me too.

00:12:41.052 --> 00:12:42.720
My big dream is you.

00:12:45.723 --> 00:12:47.433
Mmm, my allergies are acting up.

00:12:47.517 --> 00:12:48.744
There's a pepper
flake in my eye.

00:12:48.768 --> 00:12:49.811
(Laughs)

00:12:49.894 --> 00:12:51.734
Adult Dwayne: I was
feeling great, riding high,

00:12:52.772 --> 00:12:55.775
but then, boom, reality
smacked us right in the face.

00:12:56.359 --> 00:12:57.944
Excuse me. We live here.

00:12:58.069 --> 00:12:59.237
What's going on?

00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:01.572
The woman in apartment
three caught her hair on fire

00:13:01.656 --> 00:13:03.324
while trying to cook
amphetamines.

00:13:04.075 --> 00:13:05.785
Unfortunately, her
faucet didn't work,

00:13:05.868 --> 00:13:08.579
so she ran outside and tried
to jump in the pool next door,

00:13:08.663 --> 00:13:09.914
which was bone dry.

00:13:11.207 --> 00:13:13.477
She survived the fall, crawled
over to the manager's office,

00:13:13.501 --> 00:13:15.503
who, upon seeing her
disfigured body at the door,

00:13:15.586 --> 00:13:16.838
had a heart attack and died.

00:13:18.715 --> 00:13:20.466
You know what? A
house sounds pretty good.

00:13:20.550 --> 00:13:21.759
I agree.

00:13:22.135 --> 00:13:24.416
So you're saying there's been
a pool here this whole time?

00:13:26.472 --> 00:13:28.766
So, you got that
scholarship to Miami,

00:13:28.850 --> 00:13:30.643
and then, bam,
your legs get cut out.

00:13:30.768 --> 00:13:32.645
Yeah, there's that
rollercoaster again.

00:13:32.729 --> 00:13:34.873
But I tell you what, it made
me double down on my promise

00:13:34.897 --> 00:13:37.066
that I made my parents
to buy them a house.

00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:39.068
All those places we lived,

00:13:39.444 --> 00:13:40.737
we never owned our own house.

00:13:40.862 --> 00:13:42.613
Yeah, you just needed
to get to the NFL

00:13:42.697 --> 00:13:44.073
to make good on that promise.

00:13:44.157 --> 00:13:46.492
You know, I really struggled
when I first got to Miami,

00:13:46.576 --> 00:13:48.536
but I still had good
tape to show the scouts,

00:13:48.619 --> 00:13:51.497
and I had that Miami
cachet. I was hopeful.

00:13:51.581 --> 00:13:54.042
I still felt like I had a
shot at my NFL dream.

00:13:54.667 --> 00:13:57.337
Yeah, that's it, sir. Push it.

00:13:57.420 --> 00:13:58.796
Push it, 3-6-5.

00:13:59.213 --> 00:14:01.299
3-6-6 on leap years,
baby. (Laughs)

00:14:01.424 --> 00:14:02.484
Laying it on a little thick,

00:14:02.508 --> 00:14:03.509
don't you think?

00:14:03.593 --> 00:14:05.678
Hey, as long as they let
me workout here for free

00:14:05.762 --> 00:14:07.013
and get ready for the draft,

00:14:07.096 --> 00:14:08.514
I'll lay it on as
thick as... hey!

00:14:08.973 --> 00:14:10.058
Don't worry, sir.

00:14:10.141 --> 00:14:12.769
By the time we're done,
no one will believe you're 50.

00:14:12.852 --> 00:14:14.228
All right, enough.

00:14:14.479 --> 00:14:15.772
Lat check.

00:14:17.774 --> 00:14:18.858
(Rockylaughs)

00:14:21.027 --> 00:14:23.363
Oh, boy! Ooh!

00:14:23.446 --> 00:14:24.739
Look at that.

00:14:24.822 --> 00:14:26.282
Looks like a cobra's head.

00:14:26.366 --> 00:14:27.617
If igetany more swole,

00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:28.927
they're gonna need
bigger mirrors.

00:14:28.951 --> 00:14:31.204
Could cover a small
village from the rain.

00:14:31.287 --> 00:14:34.040
I think I'm finally stronger than
gaston from beauty and the beast.

00:14:34.207 --> 00:14:37.585
Gotta turn my head just to
see the range on these babies.

00:14:38.753 --> 00:14:40.254
(Both grunting)

00:14:40.797 --> 00:14:43.549
What about your job?
You have any enemies?

00:14:43.633 --> 00:14:45.718
They run the bank
of Hawaii like a family.

00:14:45.802 --> 00:14:48.471
So, if anything, I've got a bunch
of new brothers and sisters.

00:14:48.554 --> 00:14:50.306
Who's your least
favorite sister?

00:14:50.390 --> 00:14:52.058
(Clears throat) Oh.

00:14:52.308 --> 00:14:53.559
Sorry, Bob. I gotta go.

00:14:53.643 --> 00:14:54.727
Dewey needs the phone.

00:14:54.811 --> 00:14:56.437
Don't forget to send me
some koko Samoa.

00:14:56.521 --> 00:14:58.106
They don't have
any here in tonta.

00:14:58.189 --> 00:14:59.232
Tampa. Bob: Tampa.

00:14:59.315 --> 00:15:01.109
Young Lia: Yeah, okay.
Tampa, tompa. Goodbye.

00:15:02.485 --> 00:15:03.569
(Sighs)

00:15:03.653 --> 00:15:05.780
Okay, the draft
is about to start.

00:15:05.863 --> 00:15:07.949
Nobody make any calls
for the next two days.

00:15:08.616 --> 00:15:11.035
Gotta keep the line open
in case an NFL team calls.

00:15:11.619 --> 00:15:12.703
Has it started?

00:15:12.787 --> 00:15:14.539
Not yet, babe.
You're just in time.

00:15:14.622 --> 00:15:15.706
Oh, good.

00:15:15.790 --> 00:15:17.351
And I told my boss
I'm taking tomorrow off.

00:15:17.375 --> 00:15:19.544
Didn't say why.
I like to create mystery.

00:15:19.627 --> 00:15:22.130
Nothing's keeping me from
watching Dewey's big moment.

00:15:22.213 --> 00:15:24.257
Oh, you don't have to stay
for the whole draft, mom.

00:15:24.340 --> 00:15:25.818
It's just gonna be
some guys in Polo shirts

00:15:25.842 --> 00:15:26.843
looking at papers.

00:15:26.926 --> 00:15:28.594
Okay, great. I'm taking a nap.

00:15:28.678 --> 00:15:30.221
Wake me up when
something happens.

00:15:31.013 --> 00:15:32.573
Adult Dwayne: The draft
is seven rounds,

00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:34.934
and I just needed one team
to give me a shot.

00:15:35.726 --> 00:15:38.271
With the first pick
in the draft,

00:15:38.354 --> 00:15:39.647
Cincinnati bengals have selected

00:15:39.730 --> 00:15:42.525
running back from penn
state, ki-jana Carter.

00:15:44.402 --> 00:15:46.320
Should've been Dwayne Johnson.

00:15:48.281 --> 00:15:49.782
Man: With the third choice

00:15:49.866 --> 00:15:52.452
in the first round, the
Houston oilers select

00:15:52.535 --> 00:15:55.538
quarterback from alcorn
state, Steve mcnair.

00:15:55.621 --> 00:15:56.956
Not mad at a black quarterback.

00:15:57.039 --> 00:15:58.040
That's right.

00:15:59.459 --> 00:16:01.961
Man: With the 12th pick
in the first round,

00:16:02.295 --> 00:16:05.798
tampa bay selects defensive
tackle university of Miami,

00:16:05.882 --> 00:16:07.008
Warren sapp.

00:16:08.426 --> 00:16:09.844
Oh, Dewey, it's your friend.

00:16:10.011 --> 00:16:11.637
Of course, sapp's
coming to tampa.

00:16:11.721 --> 00:16:13.347
Young Lia: Look
at the tampa mascot.

00:16:13.556 --> 00:16:14.557
A woman with a mustache

00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:16.267
holding a knife in her teeth.

00:16:17.727 --> 00:16:18.853
Huh.

00:16:18.936 --> 00:16:20.229
(Rap music playing)

00:16:20.646 --> 00:16:22.773
Man: Third round,
Miami dolphins...

00:16:22.857 --> 00:16:26.360
(Overlapping announcements)

00:16:27.278 --> 00:16:28.905
And that concludes day one.

00:16:29.363 --> 00:16:31.443
Adult Dwayne: [Didn't hear
my name called on day one,

00:16:31.908 --> 00:16:34.327
but I still felt hopeful
about day two.

00:16:34.410 --> 00:16:37.246
Man 1: Welcome to day two
of... man 2: And the 109th pick...

00:16:37.413 --> 00:16:38.581
(Overlapping announcements)

00:16:38.664 --> 00:16:40.082
Jack Jackson.

00:16:40.208 --> 00:16:41.209
Man 3: Jerry Wilson.

00:16:41.292 --> 00:16:43.211
Man 2: It's the 234rd pick.

00:16:43.503 --> 00:16:47.215
(Overlapping announcements
continue)

00:16:47.882 --> 00:16:49.634
For the final pick...

00:16:49.717 --> 00:16:52.762
249th selection
in the 1995 draft

00:16:52.845 --> 00:16:55.515
goes to Michael Reed,

00:16:55.598 --> 00:16:57.683
defensive back, Boston college.

00:16:57.767 --> 00:17:00.603
And he was drafted
by the Carolina Panthers

00:17:01.062 --> 00:17:03.940
and he'll be big time in
Newport beach. Thank you.

00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:06.025
What's happened? Is it over?

00:17:09.695 --> 00:17:11.072
Yeah, it is.

00:17:11.822 --> 00:17:13.699
It's really over. (Sighs)

00:17:18.162 --> 00:17:19.914
(Somber music playing)

00:17:24.293 --> 00:17:25.795
I broke my promise.

00:17:26.963 --> 00:17:29.048
I let her down. I let
you down too, dad.

00:17:29.215 --> 00:17:31.300
I... I let everyone down.

00:17:33.302 --> 00:17:34.971
(Speaking Samoan)

00:17:35.054 --> 00:17:36.347
You're not done.

00:17:37.139 --> 00:17:39.392
Trust me, I know
from experience,

00:17:39.475 --> 00:17:41.060
it ain't over until it's over.

00:17:41.519 --> 00:17:43.396
I appreciate your
positivity, dad,

00:17:43.479 --> 00:17:46.274
but there's no working
the gimmick here.

00:17:48.943 --> 00:17:50.778
Babe, you know
we love your singing,

00:17:50.861 --> 00:17:52.071
but now's not...

00:17:53.990 --> 00:17:55.491
I want you to have this,

00:17:56.325 --> 00:17:58.369
so no matter how far
your journey takes you,

00:17:58.452 --> 00:18:00.705
you can play a song and
be right back with your family.

00:18:01.247 --> 00:18:02.748
Mom, thank you,

00:18:02.873 --> 00:18:04.667
but I'm not going anywhere.

00:18:05.001 --> 00:18:07.587
Maybe not right away,
but you will.

00:18:08.796 --> 00:18:10.172
And when you do,

00:18:10.298 --> 00:18:12.018
this is your reminder
that you're not alone.

00:18:14.468 --> 00:18:15.970
You carry all of us with you.

00:18:21.017 --> 00:18:22.476
(Phone ringing)

00:18:29.025 --> 00:18:30.318
Hello? Man: Hello.

00:18:30.443 --> 00:18:32.820
Is this the university
of Miami's Dwayne Johnson?

00:18:32.903 --> 00:18:34.238
Uh, yes, sir, it is.

00:18:34.697 --> 00:18:36.574
(Wind howling)

00:18:40.161 --> 00:18:41.370
Young Dwayne: Hello?

00:18:43.456 --> 00:18:44.665
Hello?

00:18:47.418 --> 00:18:48.794
Hello?

00:18:49.086 --> 00:18:52.214
Man: Hey, you must be
Dwayne Johnson!

00:18:52.882 --> 00:18:54.925
Well, on behalf
of the calgary stampeders,

00:18:55.301 --> 00:18:58.012
welcome to the Canadian
football league!

00:19:00.056 --> 00:19:01.974
Hey, what's with
the tiny guitar, eh?

00:19:04.685 --> 00:19:06.729
Young Dwayne: I got it
from my mom. It's an ukulele.

00:19:06.896 --> 00:19:08.522
Man: That's tiny.
Young Dwayne: Yeah.

00:19:09.106 --> 00:19:10.983
Canada? Canada.

00:19:11.275 --> 00:19:12.902
Huh. So you kept your dream

00:19:12.985 --> 00:19:14.737
of playing professional
football alive.

00:19:14.820 --> 00:19:16.030
Hell yes, I did.

00:19:16.113 --> 00:19:17.490
If they were gonna
pay me to play,

00:19:17.573 --> 00:19:18.866
then that's where
I was gonna go.

00:19:18.949 --> 00:19:21.786
You know, look, my goal
was to crush it in the cfl

00:19:21.869 --> 00:19:23.871
and then get signed
by an NFL team.

00:19:23.954 --> 00:19:25.414
Well, I would ask you how long

00:19:25.498 --> 00:19:26.978
you played pro football
in Canada for,

00:19:27.166 --> 00:19:29.960
but I have a feeling that's
also a story for another time.

00:19:30.044 --> 00:19:31.244
And you know it's a great one.

00:19:31.629 --> 00:19:33.464
Look, no matter what happens,

00:19:33.547 --> 00:19:35.341
whether I become
president or not,

00:19:35.758 --> 00:19:37.843
I wanted to share some
personal stories with people

00:19:37.927 --> 00:19:40.179
to show them that I understand
where they're coming from,

00:19:40.262 --> 00:19:41.639
because I've been there.

00:19:41.722 --> 00:19:44.517
Well, thank you so much,
candidate Johnson, for your time,

00:19:45.101 --> 00:19:46.560
and best ofluck in the election.

00:19:46.894 --> 00:19:48.479
Although, I don't
think youwlneedit

00:19:48.729 --> 00:19:50.189
well, thank you
very much, Randall.

00:19:50.272 --> 00:19:51.565
It's my pleasure,

00:19:51.649 --> 00:19:53.249
and you always need
a little bit of luck.

00:19:55.194 --> 00:19:57.446
Woman: All right, candidate
Johnson. That's a wrap.

00:19:57.530 --> 00:19:59.323
Thank you. (Bell ringing)

00:19:59.949 --> 00:20:01.450
(Indistinct chatter)

00:20:01.867 --> 00:20:03.327
(Birds cooing)

00:20:07.540 --> 00:20:08.624
Mom?

00:20:09.625 --> 00:20:11.043
How'd you know where to find me?

00:20:11.127 --> 00:20:12.878
You always find spots like this

00:20:12.962 --> 00:20:14.964
where you just come
and sit and think

00:20:15.047 --> 00:20:17.883
ever since andré and
you and your birds.

00:20:17.967 --> 00:20:19.677
Yeah. (Chuckles)

00:20:20.261 --> 00:20:21.887
These interviews,
mom, I've been doing,

00:20:21.971 --> 00:20:23.723
it's really gotten me nostalgic.

00:20:25.975 --> 00:20:27.518
Can you believe
how far we've come?

00:20:27.643 --> 00:20:29.979
Yes, Dewey, we are blessed.

00:20:30.062 --> 00:20:31.814
We're very blessed.

00:20:32.064 --> 00:20:33.232
I wish dad could've been here

00:20:33.315 --> 00:20:34.775
to see where we're at right now.

00:20:39.655 --> 00:20:41.031
He is here.

00:20:41.657 --> 00:20:43.242
He's very proud of you.

00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:45.453
(Softly) Yeah.

00:20:46.537 --> 00:20:47.830
He's here right now.

00:20:49.915 --> 00:20:51.675
What do you think
grandma's saying right now?

00:20:52.334 --> 00:20:54.879
"Take the smacks out."
(Both laughing)

00:20:58.132 --> 00:20:59.425
I better get going.

00:21:00.092 --> 00:21:01.385
Letsgo. Comeon

00:21:01.886 --> 00:21:03.053
all right.

00:21:03.721 --> 00:21:05.031
We gotta get to
a press conference.

00:21:05.055 --> 00:21:06.658
Do you want me to
write some lines for you?

00:21:06.682 --> 00:21:08.362
Adult Dwayne:
(Chuckles) No, mom, I'm good.

00:21:14.148 --> 00:21:15.483
(Sighs)

00:21:15.566 --> 00:21:17.693
Mom, I think I might
just win this thing.

00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:19.862
President Dewey.

00:21:22.656 --> 00:21:24.992
(Excited chatter)
(Camera shutters clicking)
