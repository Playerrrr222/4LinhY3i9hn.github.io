00:00:05.047 --> 00:00:08.383
(Machines whirring)

00:00:08.467 --> 00:00:10.677
Keep shredding the nice lists!

00:00:10.761 --> 00:00:13.305
No one's getting presents
this year!

00:00:13.847 --> 00:00:15.682
Get back to work,

00:00:15.766 --> 00:00:17.726
or I'll feed you to Jack frost!

00:00:18.977 --> 00:00:23.023
(Pounding at door)
(Voices shouting)

00:00:23.106 --> 00:00:26.735
Hide! (Person screams)

00:00:26.818 --> 00:00:29.446
(Wood splintering)

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:36.286
(Metallic clanging)

00:00:36.703 --> 00:00:38.163
(Thuds)

00:00:39.873 --> 00:00:41.375
(Hopeful music)

00:00:41.458 --> 00:00:43.835
You're safe now.
You can come out.

00:00:47.256 --> 00:00:48.340
Who are you?

00:00:48.423 --> 00:00:49.466
I'm big Tim.

00:00:50.008 --> 00:00:52.427
That's right.
Tiny Tim is all grown up.

00:00:52.511 --> 00:00:54.304
And I need you
to help me save Christmas.

00:00:54.805 --> 00:00:56.014
Those men out there?

00:00:56.098 --> 00:00:57.975
They work for Ibiza scrooge.

00:00:58.058 --> 00:01:01.478
(All gasp)
Ebenezer's granddaughter?

00:01:01.562 --> 00:01:02.646
The very one.

00:01:03.146 --> 00:01:05.816
She captured Mrs. Claus,
stole Santa's sleigh,

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:07.734
and she's taken
New Orleans hostage.

00:01:07.818 --> 00:01:10.821
The ghost of Christmas future
has shown me what's to come.

00:01:10.904 --> 00:01:13.991
And if Ibiza scrooge succeeds
at blowing up bourbon street,

00:01:14.783 --> 00:01:17.160
Christmas is over forever.

00:01:17.244 --> 00:01:19.037
Now, I don't know
about you guys,

00:01:19.121 --> 00:01:21.623
but I don't want to live
in a world without Christmas.

00:01:22.624 --> 00:01:24.960
Let's go save Christmas.

00:01:25.043 --> 00:01:26.086
(Music fades out)

00:01:26.169 --> 00:01:27.629
And cut.

00:01:27.713 --> 00:01:29.798
(Bell rings) Good job.

00:01:30.382 --> 00:01:32.467
Dwayne, can we, uh...

00:01:32.551 --> 00:01:33.927
Yeah, I'd love to.

00:01:35.095 --> 00:01:36.221
What's going on with her?

00:01:36.305 --> 00:01:38.807
I don't know. That
last line, there's just...

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:39.891
Flat. Flat.

00:01:39.975 --> 00:01:41.893
Completely flat. Yeah, nothing.

00:01:41.977 --> 00:01:44.229
I mean, it doesn't seem like
she is remotely moved at all

00:01:44.313 --> 00:01:45.355
by my big speech.

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:47.482
You wanna replace her?
With who? Kevin hart?

00:01:47.566 --> 00:01:49.085
I mean, we can't.
She's eight years old.

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:50.277
Would Kevin do this?

00:01:51.278 --> 00:01:53.071
No, I don't think
we can replace her.

00:01:53.155 --> 00:01:55.532
I mean, she's an Oscar
nominee, for god's sake.

00:01:56.074 --> 00:01:57.701
This is the biggest scene
in the movie.

00:01:57.784 --> 00:01:58.952
Now, if I can't convince her

00:01:59.036 --> 00:02:00.370
that Christmas is worth saving,

00:02:00.454 --> 00:02:02.094
then how am I gonna convince
the audience?

00:02:02.122 --> 00:02:03.248
There's no movie.

00:02:04.666 --> 00:02:06.543
Hey, Leslie. Hey.

00:02:06.627 --> 00:02:08.646
Is everything okay?
You just... you seem a little...

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:09.671
I'm fine.

00:02:09.755 --> 00:02:11.555
Just annoyed we're on
take nine of this scene.

00:02:12.215 --> 00:02:13.759
I mean, you and I,

00:02:14.176 --> 00:02:16.386
we've been around
for a long time.

00:02:16.511 --> 00:02:17.596
Between us,

00:02:17.679 --> 00:02:20.807
we're working way too hard
for a dumb Christmas movie.

00:02:20.891 --> 00:02:24.519
Well, a Christmas peril
isn't a dumb Christmas movie.

00:02:24.603 --> 00:02:27.356
I know it's based on
a dickens classic or whatever,

00:02:27.439 --> 00:02:28.523
but a bunch of ghosts

00:02:28.607 --> 00:02:30.859
coming to teach you
about Christmas spirit?

00:02:30.942 --> 00:02:32.361
It's absurd.

00:02:32.444 --> 00:02:35.572
I know it sounds absurd,
but it's not.

00:02:36.114 --> 00:02:38.533
I know because
it actually happened to me.

00:02:39.284 --> 00:02:43.413
It was Christmas 1982,
and I was about your age.

00:02:43.497 --> 00:02:45.540
I was living
with my family in Hawaii,

00:02:45.624 --> 00:02:48.126
and it was going to be
the best Christmas ever.

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:50.295
Ho, ho, ho. Merry christm...

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:53.382
(Upbeat music playing)

00:02:53.465 --> 00:02:55.217
Commentator:
Santa claus is down.

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:56.677
You know what that means.

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.929
Mrs. Claus is up for grabs.

00:02:59.471 --> 00:03:01.223
Dwayne: My mom and I
were at a holiday match

00:03:01.306 --> 00:03:02.724
that my grandma was promoting,

00:03:02.808 --> 00:03:04.935
and she got all the best guys
to participate.

00:03:05.018 --> 00:03:06.019
(All cheering)

00:03:06.103 --> 00:03:07.288
Young rock:
Slay them, Santa dad!

00:03:07.312 --> 00:03:09.815
Dwayne: My dad, the sou/man,
rocky Johnson,

00:03:09.898 --> 00:03:12.150
the iron sheik, andré the giant,

00:03:12.234 --> 00:03:15.278
"macho man" Randy savage,
and the wild Samoans.

00:03:15.362 --> 00:03:16.988
Commentator:
Sika has the mistletoe!

00:03:17.072 --> 00:03:20.117
If he gets it to Mrs. Claus
and kisses her underneath it,

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.327
he wins the lady and the match.

00:03:22.452 --> 00:03:23.787
He's been notoriously lonely

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:25.497
since his ex-girlfriend
stabbed him.

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:26.581
Oh, my god!

00:03:26.665 --> 00:03:28.667
Ain't no trade

00:03:29.584 --> 00:03:31.294
Santa's got a brand-new bag

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:33.755
(thud)

00:03:33.839 --> 00:03:35.006
(Cheers and applause)

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:36.883
Commentator:
She doesn't need a Santa.

00:03:36.967 --> 00:03:40.137
She's a career woman
who can make it on her own.

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:43.640
It's 1982, folks.
It's a woman's world.

00:03:43.724 --> 00:03:45.726
Yeah! Yeah! (Bell dings)

00:03:47.811 --> 00:03:51.356
Here you are,
my famous keke pua'a.

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:53.191
All: Ooh!

00:03:53.275 --> 00:03:54.317
Finally.

00:03:54.401 --> 00:03:55.694
Been waiting all year for these.

00:03:55.777 --> 00:03:57.237
(Laughs) You're too slow, rocky.

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:59.239
Get in line, sucker. (Laughs)

00:03:59.322 --> 00:04:01.658
Nah, merry Christmas, man.
Thanks for having us.

00:04:02.325 --> 00:04:03.535
Randy, you never told me

00:04:03.618 --> 00:04:05.120
your girlfriend
could kick like that.

00:04:05.203 --> 00:04:06.413
Ooh, Elizabeth is great.

00:04:06.496 --> 00:04:08.999
Yeah, she really
gets into character.

00:04:09.082 --> 00:04:10.083
I do.

00:04:10.167 --> 00:04:12.210
In my mind, Santa cheated
on me with an elf,

00:04:12.294 --> 00:04:13.628
and I finally had it.

00:04:13.712 --> 00:04:15.005
(Laughs)

00:04:15.088 --> 00:04:17.549
I cannot wait to open
my present tomorrow morning.

00:04:17.632 --> 00:04:18.759
I already know what it is.

00:04:18.842 --> 00:04:20.343
I only asked for
one thing this year.

00:04:20.427 --> 00:04:21.470
A boat?

00:04:21.553 --> 00:04:24.014
Better. A cabbage patch kid.

00:04:24.097 --> 00:04:25.807
(Scoffs) Where are the ribbons?

00:04:25.891 --> 00:04:27.517
Where is the tissue paper?

00:04:27.601 --> 00:04:29.478
Whoever wrapped this
hates children.

00:04:29.561 --> 00:04:31.521
My mom. She tries.

00:04:31.605 --> 00:04:32.939
Hey, put that back.

00:04:33.023 --> 00:04:34.399
It's not Christmas morning yet.

00:04:34.775 --> 00:04:36.443
(Whispering) See
you tomorrow. (Kisses)

00:04:36.526 --> 00:04:39.529
Andre, why are you
still dressed as Merlin?

00:04:39.613 --> 00:04:42.324
Mean gene, I'm pere Noel.

00:04:42.407 --> 00:04:43.408
Who's pere Noel?

00:04:43.492 --> 00:04:45.076
He's the father Christmas
in France.

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:46.578
So like green Santa?

00:04:46.661 --> 00:04:47.662
Green Santa?

00:04:47.746 --> 00:04:49.247
(Laughing) No.

00:04:49.331 --> 00:04:52.375
He brings Christmas magic
to whoever need it most.

00:04:52.459 --> 00:04:54.586
(Laughs)

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:55.921
Okay.

00:04:56.004 --> 00:04:57.380
I went to three different stores

00:04:57.464 --> 00:04:58.524
looking for Dewey's present.

00:04:58.548 --> 00:05:00.091
There's that many stores now?

00:05:00.175 --> 00:05:01.760
Everywhere was sold out.

00:05:01.843 --> 00:05:03.678
But I finally found it.
(Exclaims)

00:05:04.221 --> 00:05:05.222
I'm going to bed.

00:05:05.305 --> 00:05:06.473
It's only 08:30.

00:05:06.556 --> 00:05:07.891
Are you even tired?

00:05:07.974 --> 00:05:09.226
No, not really.

00:05:09.309 --> 00:05:10.811
Hey, sheik,
can you choke me out?

00:05:10.894 --> 00:05:11.978
Yes, baba.

00:05:12.062 --> 00:05:13.104
Oh, no, no, no, no!

00:05:13.188 --> 00:05:14.564
What? What did I do?

00:05:14.648 --> 00:05:16.024
It's fine. I'lljustdrink nyquil.

00:05:16.107 --> 00:05:17.108
Don'tdrink nyquil.

00:05:17.192 --> 00:05:18.527
No sleep-enhancing drugs!

00:05:20.987 --> 00:05:23.949
(Banging, rustling)

00:05:24.741 --> 00:05:31.623
(Suspenseful music)

00:05:40.173 --> 00:05:41.716
(Metal clanging)

00:05:43.593 --> 00:05:44.636
Santa?

00:05:47.138 --> 00:05:48.849
No, dude. I'm you.

00:05:49.933 --> 00:05:50.976
From the future.

00:05:51.518 --> 00:05:54.396
Wow. Me at 40.

00:05:54.771 --> 00:05:55.856
I'm 15.

00:05:55.939 --> 00:05:57.357
Fantastic.

00:05:57.816 --> 00:05:59.067
I've come to warn you.

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:02.237
Tomorrow is gonna be
the worst day of your life.

00:06:05.073 --> 00:06:06.825
You really expect me to believe

00:06:06.908 --> 00:06:09.035
that the ghost
of your 15-year-old self

00:06:09.119 --> 00:06:10.620
came to visit
your 10-year-old self

00:06:10.704 --> 00:06:11.705
on Christmas Eve?

00:06:11.788 --> 00:06:13.724
Hey, look, I'm just telling
you what happened, all right?

00:06:13.748 --> 00:06:14.809
But if you don't wanna hear it,

00:06:14.833 --> 00:06:15.893
let's get back to work. Come on.

00:06:15.917 --> 00:06:18.128
No, no, no. I didn't say that.

00:06:18.211 --> 00:06:20.755
Just voicing some questions.
Confinue.

00:06:21.673 --> 00:06:24.551
All right,
so me and my ghost self,

00:06:24.634 --> 00:06:26.720
we were hanging out
in my grandma's kitchen.

00:06:26.803 --> 00:06:27.888
You can eat?

00:06:28.263 --> 00:06:30.599
Yeah, but I don't go
to the bathroom.

00:06:31.141 --> 00:06:32.434
Whoa.

00:06:32.517 --> 00:06:35.437
Wait, how can tomorrow
be the worst day of my life?

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:37.814
It's Christmas, and I'm
getting a cabbage patch kid.

00:06:38.231 --> 00:06:39.399
Check the present.

00:06:39.482 --> 00:06:46.364
(Suspenseful music)

00:06:51.953 --> 00:06:53.663
What is this?

00:06:53.747 --> 00:06:55.040
Radish baby?

00:06:55.123 --> 00:06:56.917
A knock-off cabbage patch kid.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.561
Someone told mom
it was even more popular

00:06:58.585 --> 00:06:59.628
than the regular ones.

00:06:59.711 --> 00:07:02.339
No. This is the worst
present ever.

00:07:02.422 --> 00:07:04.108
That's exactly what you'll say
tomorrow morning

00:07:04.132 --> 00:07:05.133
when you open it.

00:07:05.216 --> 00:07:06.676
Why have you
shown me this, spirit?

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:08.219
Well, I figured maybe at least

00:07:08.303 --> 00:07:10.430
you could salvage
some of this Christmas.

00:07:10.513 --> 00:07:11.806
Because from this year forward,

00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:13.558
our christmases only get worse.

00:07:13.642 --> 00:07:14.935
Worse than this?

00:07:15.018 --> 00:07:18.021
There is 1,000%
a soul trapped in here.

00:07:18.104 --> 00:07:20.690
If you don't believe me,
I can show you.

00:07:20.815 --> 00:07:23.109
But I'm warning you, it's bad.

00:07:26.696 --> 00:07:27.697
(Door opens)

00:07:27.989 --> 00:07:31.242
(Indistinct chatter)

00:07:31.326 --> 00:07:37.290
(Festive music playing)

00:07:44.381 --> 00:07:46.299
Where are we?

00:07:46.383 --> 00:07:49.052
Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. 1987.

00:07:49.219 --> 00:07:51.805
This is our worst
Christmas ever.

00:07:54.432 --> 00:07:55.475
Mom?

00:07:55.642 --> 00:07:57.519
She can't hear you. No one can.

00:07:57.602 --> 00:07:59.938
Money was tight,
so we all gotjobs at the mall

00:08:00.021 --> 00:08:01.523
to make extra cash
for the holidays.

00:08:01.606 --> 00:08:03.733
Mom's job was wrapping gifts.

00:08:03.817 --> 00:08:06.486
Here you are, sir.
Merry Christmas.

00:08:06.611 --> 00:08:08.154
It looks like it was stomped on.

00:08:08.321 --> 00:08:09.739
With joy?

00:08:09.864 --> 00:08:11.992
Reindeer hoofs of joy? (Laughs)

00:08:12.242 --> 00:08:15.286
And ourjob was that.

00:08:15.370 --> 00:08:16.454
(Santa) Ho, ho!

00:08:16.579 --> 00:08:18.665
And what do you want
for Christmas?

00:08:18.748 --> 00:08:20.208
I want a Nintendo.

00:08:20.291 --> 00:08:21.918
A Nintendo, huh?

00:08:22.002 --> 00:08:24.254
Well, hopefully,
you're on the nice list.

00:08:24.504 --> 00:08:25.630
What do you say, elf?

00:08:25.714 --> 00:08:27.298
Is Marty on the nice list?

00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:29.426
As if this wasn't
humiliating enough,

00:08:29.551 --> 00:08:31.594
dad decided to start a war
with the cheese guy.

00:08:31.678 --> 00:08:33.555
This is premium cheese,
rolled in nuts,

00:08:33.638 --> 00:08:34.889
shaped into a ball.

00:08:34.973 --> 00:08:37.017
Behold the holiday cheeseball.
(Crowd gasps)

00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:39.310
How is he drawing
a bigger crowd than me?

00:08:39.477 --> 00:08:42.480
Santa's the main event.
Thatjoker's the undercard.

00:08:43.023 --> 00:08:44.816
Oh, we gotta get eyes
back on us.

00:08:44.983 --> 00:08:46.943
I'm actually fine with eyes
not being on us.

00:08:47.027 --> 00:08:49.005
I don't want anyone from
school to see me like this.

00:08:49.029 --> 00:08:51.048
Well, then, you should have
put yourself up for adoption

00:08:51.072 --> 00:08:52.866
'cause you got a daddy
that likes to be seen.

00:08:54.451 --> 00:08:58.705
Ho, ho, ho!

00:08:58.788 --> 00:09:00.707
(Laughs)

00:09:00.832 --> 00:09:04.836
Feast your eyes on
hunky Santa. (Laughs)

00:09:04.919 --> 00:09:07.589
Now, don't tell Mrs. Claus.
(Laughs)

00:09:07.839 --> 00:09:10.425
Drink your milk, children.
(Laughs)

00:09:10.508 --> 00:09:12.802
Let's see the cheese man
do this!

00:09:12.886 --> 00:09:16.473
Oh, you mad, cheese guy?
Yeah, you mad. Bladow!

00:09:16.556 --> 00:09:18.349
(Cheers and applause)

00:09:18.516 --> 00:09:20.351
Honestly, I still don't think

00:09:20.435 --> 00:09:22.729
this Christmas
is worse than radish baby.

00:09:22.937 --> 00:09:24.397
You haven't seen the worst part.

00:09:24.481 --> 00:09:27.442
Hey, elf, why the long face?

00:09:27.525 --> 00:09:29.736
Where is your Christmas spirit?

00:09:29.861 --> 00:09:31.321
Be the heel. They'll love it.

00:09:31.529 --> 00:09:32.822
Oh, no.

00:09:33.156 --> 00:09:36.284
You must be one of those bad
elves from the naughty list.

00:09:36.534 --> 00:09:37.869
(Crowd oohs) Yeah.

00:09:37.952 --> 00:09:41.039
And if you are, you have to do
the naughty dance.

00:09:41.206 --> 00:09:43.333
(Crowd oohs)

00:09:43.416 --> 00:09:44.417
What's the naughty dance?

00:09:44.501 --> 00:09:45.543
Just make something up.

00:09:45.627 --> 00:09:49.130
(Crowd chanting "naughty dance")

00:09:50.256 --> 00:09:51.925
(Crowd cheering)

00:09:52.008 --> 00:09:54.594
(Laughter)

00:09:54.677 --> 00:09:56.721
Ho, ho, ho. There it is.

00:09:57.388 --> 00:09:59.849
Okay. So,
we never learned to dance.

00:09:59.974 --> 00:10:01.017
Ho, ho, ho!

00:10:01.101 --> 00:10:03.686
Shake that Booty! Thunderclaps!

00:10:03.770 --> 00:10:07.857
It's raining candy.
Ho, ho, ho, ho!

00:10:07.941 --> 00:10:10.652
Oh, my god, Karen.

00:10:10.735 --> 00:10:11.861
Hey, Dwayne.

00:10:11.945 --> 00:10:12.946
Who are they?

00:10:13.029 --> 00:10:14.656
My ex-girlfriend
and her new boyfriend.

00:10:15.115 --> 00:10:17.242
She was our girlfriend
and you messed it up?

00:10:17.534 --> 00:10:18.660
You crazy?

00:10:19.702 --> 00:10:21.454
Hey, uh, that was just, like,

00:10:21.538 --> 00:10:22.872
a skit me and my dad were doing.

00:10:22.956 --> 00:10:24.874
Oh, yeah. It was really funny.

00:10:25.583 --> 00:10:27.961
Yeah, maybe you can do
another elf dance for us.

00:10:28.253 --> 00:10:30.088
Kevin, let's get back
to shopping.

00:10:30.171 --> 00:10:32.757
Yeah, Kevin, you should
get back to fashion bug.

00:10:32.841 --> 00:10:34.092
My aunt works there,

00:10:34.175 --> 00:10:36.302
and they actually have
good belts for men.

00:10:36.386 --> 00:10:39.097
Ugh, over this. Outta here.

00:10:41.933 --> 00:10:43.810
Karen, come back.

00:10:43.893 --> 00:10:45.770
Shut up and get me
a candy cane, elf.

00:10:46.312 --> 00:10:47.480
You want a candy cane?

00:10:48.439 --> 00:10:49.839
Careful, they're bad
for your teeth.

00:10:51.526 --> 00:10:53.278
(Yells)

00:10:53.361 --> 00:10:55.613
Wait, wait, wait, wait! Oh, no!

00:10:55.697 --> 00:10:58.449
(Crowd screams)

00:10:58.533 --> 00:11:00.869
You hit him
with a candy cane just like...

00:11:00.952 --> 00:11:03.329
Just like my character does
to Ibiza scrooge

00:11:03.454 --> 00:11:04.747
in the climactic battle

00:11:04.831 --> 00:11:06.666
at the Mercedes-Benz superdome.

00:11:07.458 --> 00:11:08.543
You write what you know.

00:11:08.835 --> 00:11:10.545
So that fight gets us fired.

00:11:10.879 --> 00:11:14.090
That and some literal nuns
complained about hunky Santa.

00:11:15.133 --> 00:11:17.802
But even worse,
the manager docks our pay

00:11:17.886 --> 00:11:20.805
because he has to replace the
Santa costume and the house.

00:11:20.889 --> 00:11:23.016
So we don't even make any money?

00:11:23.183 --> 00:11:26.895
Nope. I told you.
It's the worst Christmas ever.

00:11:28.396 --> 00:11:29.647
I don't know about that.

00:11:31.482 --> 00:11:32.734
Who is he?

00:11:33.193 --> 00:11:34.485
I don't know.

00:11:41.576 --> 00:11:44.120
Both: Wow. Us at 40.

00:11:44.204 --> 00:11:46.122
Actually, we're 21.

00:11:46.414 --> 00:11:49.667
Welcome to 1993 Miami,
little me's.

00:11:49.918 --> 00:11:52.420
And to the real worst
Christmas ever.

00:11:55.965 --> 00:11:58.384
Of course, Christmas ghosts
always come in threes.

00:11:58.551 --> 00:11:59.677
Were you scared?

00:11:59.886 --> 00:12:01.346
Not at first.

00:12:01.763 --> 00:12:03.723
Young rock:
Look at howjacked I am.

00:12:03.806 --> 00:12:05.016
How much can we lift?

00:12:05.141 --> 00:12:07.560
What about the treadmill?
Can we lift the treadmill?

00:12:07.644 --> 00:12:09.854
I didn't bring you here
to watch me lift,

00:12:10.021 --> 00:12:12.357
though, yeah, sure, I could
probably lift the treadmill.

00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:14.943
I brought you here because
y'all don't know a thing

00:12:15.026 --> 00:12:16.569
about bad christmases.

00:12:16.653 --> 00:12:19.072
Okay, this is the worst one.

00:12:19.656 --> 00:12:22.742
(Suspenseful music)

00:12:23.326 --> 00:12:24.744
(Grunts)

00:12:32.377 --> 00:12:33.670
Who are you calling?

00:12:34.254 --> 00:12:35.380
Mom and dad.

00:12:36.130 --> 00:12:39.842
Lia: Watch, iron sheik is about to
take out the unsanctioned mistletoe.

00:12:39.926 --> 00:12:41.803
I know, Lia. I was there.

00:12:41.886 --> 00:12:44.138
I can't believe we're not gonna
spend Christmas together.

00:12:44.222 --> 00:12:45.890
Yeah, I know.
I'm bummed, too, mom.

00:12:45.974 --> 00:12:49.060
But everyone stuck around
to train for the fiesta bowl.

00:12:50.144 --> 00:12:51.187
Why'd you lie to mom?

00:12:51.271 --> 00:12:54.190
It was easier than saying,
"I don't wanna spend Christmas

00:12:54.274 --> 00:12:56.401
"in a cramped apartment
listening to dad and grandma

00:12:56.526 --> 00:12:58.152
have one of their
boozy arguments."

00:12:58.236 --> 00:13:00.154
It's smart to own a gun.

00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:01.674
What if you need
to protect yourself?

00:13:01.698 --> 00:13:03.157
Anyone can pull a trigger.

00:13:03.449 --> 00:13:05.827
But who needs guns
when you got these?

00:13:05.952 --> 00:13:07.996
Fist, snap, pick your poison.

00:13:08.079 --> 00:13:10.331
Hey, babe. What's Dewey's
opinion on guns?

00:13:10.415 --> 00:13:12.125
I should get back
to practice, mom.

00:13:12.542 --> 00:13:14.311
Are you sure you don't want us
to come over after?

00:13:14.335 --> 00:13:15.670
It's just a quick
four-hour drive.

00:13:15.753 --> 00:13:17.255
Thanks, but I'll be
with the team.

00:13:17.338 --> 00:13:19.507
I figured I might as well skip
the whole thing.

00:13:19.674 --> 00:13:21.068
I mean, what's the point
in doing it

00:13:21.092 --> 00:13:22.635
if you know
it's just gonna disappoint?

00:13:22.719 --> 00:13:23.886
Amen, brother.

00:13:24.012 --> 00:13:25.430
Don't try and be cool

00:13:25.513 --> 00:13:28.141
in front of the coolest
version of us, man.

00:13:28.683 --> 00:13:31.352
So we're just gonna spend
Christmas all alone?

00:13:32.061 --> 00:13:33.062
I wish. (Door opens)

00:13:33.146 --> 00:13:34.272
Dewey?

00:13:34.647 --> 00:13:36.333
What are you doing here, man?
It's Christmas Eve.

00:13:36.357 --> 00:13:38.901
Coach 0, yeah, I figured
I'd just stick around.

00:13:38.985 --> 00:13:40.305
Is your family
gonna come see you?

00:13:40.361 --> 00:13:41.362
Oh, they can't.

00:13:41.446 --> 00:13:43.781
They're, um,
they're on a cruise.

00:13:43.948 --> 00:13:45.148
So what are you doing tonight?

00:13:45.199 --> 00:13:46.701
I don't know. Get some subway.

00:13:46.784 --> 00:13:47.994
Watch Wayne's world 2.

00:13:48.119 --> 00:13:49.912
No, you're coming to my house.

00:13:50.038 --> 00:13:51.497
No, coach,
you don't have to do that.

00:13:51.581 --> 00:13:53.291
Hey, I've seen home alone,

00:13:53.374 --> 00:13:55.918
and I ain't gonna let you
spend Christmas by yourself.

00:13:56.044 --> 00:13:58.880
Too risky. Let's go.
(Sighs in exasperation)

00:14:00.715 --> 00:14:01.716
(Door opens)

00:14:01.799 --> 00:14:04.302
Dwayne, this is my mother,
coco orgeron.

00:14:04.385 --> 00:14:06.137
And, mama, this is Dwayne.

00:14:06.220 --> 00:14:08.222
He was gonna spend Christmas
by himself.

00:14:08.306 --> 00:14:10.433
Aww, pauve ti bete.

00:14:11.851 --> 00:14:13.311
(Speaking cajun)

00:14:13.394 --> 00:14:17.106
I love the way she speaks.
What language is that?

00:14:17.231 --> 00:14:18.232
Cajun-English.

00:14:18.316 --> 00:14:20.818
Can't wait to try it.
Well, you're gonna have to.

00:14:20.902 --> 00:14:23.404
That ain't gonna be ready
for at least a couple hours.

00:14:23.488 --> 00:14:25.573
Gotta simmer. (Chuckles) Simmer.

00:14:25.698 --> 00:14:27.325
Hey, you like music?

00:14:27.450 --> 00:14:29.327
(Festive acapella music playing)

00:14:29.410 --> 00:14:32.455
Can you believe it? Acapella.

00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:36.626
All 33 tracks, no instruments,
just mouths.

00:14:36.918 --> 00:14:41.464
That's a mouth. That's
a mouth. That's a mouth.

00:14:41.714 --> 00:14:44.258
Honestly, strong me,
I'm a little offended

00:14:44.342 --> 00:14:47.970
you think this even compares
to radish baby.

00:14:48.054 --> 00:14:49.889
Yeah, this is not that bad.

00:14:49.972 --> 00:14:52.975
Oh, yeah? Let me fast-forward
three hours from now.

00:14:59.565 --> 00:15:01.401
Now this is drums.

00:15:01.943 --> 00:15:03.736
I'm just kidding!
It's a mouth still!

00:15:03.820 --> 00:15:06.155
(Laughs)

00:15:06.239 --> 00:15:07.532
I'm gonna go check on the gumbo.

00:15:07.615 --> 00:15:08.616
There you go.

00:15:09.742 --> 00:15:13.162
(Chuckles) Another mouth.

00:15:13.246 --> 00:15:15.248
Hey, Mrs. 0. You need any help?

00:15:15.331 --> 00:15:18.876
Oh, me. Ain't you sweet, sha?
I do gotta visit the cabin.

00:15:19.001 --> 00:15:21.295
Y'all stir for me, sha.
Stir, stir.

00:15:22.046 --> 00:15:24.882
Oh, yeah, now I see why
it's the worst Christmas ever.

00:15:24.966 --> 00:15:27.176
You had to stir soup.

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:28.469
I didn't just stir it.

00:15:29.679 --> 00:15:30.721
I was starving.

00:15:30.805 --> 00:15:32.849
I was just trying
to speed up the process.

00:15:33.141 --> 00:15:34.642
Even I know that's a bad idea!

00:15:34.725 --> 00:15:36.519
What you doing?

00:15:36.894 --> 00:15:38.729
You put salt in my gumbo?

00:15:38.813 --> 00:15:41.649
Messing around with my salt.
(Thuds)

00:15:41.732 --> 00:15:42.733
(Engine roaring)

00:15:42.817 --> 00:15:44.819
Is she okay? Is she dead?

00:15:44.944 --> 00:15:47.613
You never touch
a woman's gumbo, son! Never!

00:15:47.697 --> 00:15:49.866
I'm sorry. But it needed salt.

00:15:49.949 --> 00:15:52.034
It didn't. Just drive.

00:15:52.118 --> 00:15:54.454
(Engine roaring)

00:15:54.537 --> 00:15:55.705
Does she die?

00:15:55.788 --> 00:15:57.123
No, she's fine.

00:15:57.331 --> 00:15:59.292
The doctors called it
a stress faint.

00:15:59.417 --> 00:16:02.044
But we spent the rest
of the night in the hospital.

00:16:02.128 --> 00:16:04.755
That's why this is the worst
Christmas ever.

00:16:04.881 --> 00:16:07.633
Honestly, ever since
radish baby,

00:16:07.925 --> 00:16:10.386
Christmas has always
found a way to let us down.

00:16:10.470 --> 00:16:12.221
We just have terrible
christmases

00:16:12.305 --> 00:16:13.389
for the rest of our lives?

00:16:13.473 --> 00:16:14.515
Looks like it.

00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:18.186
(Gentle music)

00:16:18.269 --> 00:16:21.439
Is it snowing? In Miami?

00:16:21.647 --> 00:16:23.816
But not everywhere?

00:16:27.361 --> 00:16:34.202
(Choir vocalizing)

00:17:03.898 --> 00:17:08.069
(Laughs) Hey, deweys!

00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:10.446
André?

00:17:11.239 --> 00:17:13.282
What was in that gumbo?

00:17:13.366 --> 00:17:15.409
(Laughing)

00:17:16.827 --> 00:17:19.080
Andre? Is that really you?

00:17:19.205 --> 00:17:22.083
I am not andré.
I'm the pere Noel.

00:17:22.291 --> 00:17:23.918
He brings Christmas magic to...

00:17:24.001 --> 00:17:25.461
Whoever needs it most.

00:17:25.545 --> 00:17:27.338
Yes, he does.

00:17:27.421 --> 00:17:29.048
Young rock: Why
have you come, pere Noel?

00:17:29.131 --> 00:17:31.342
Are you here to change
our terrible christmases?

00:17:31.467 --> 00:17:35.346
The only thing I'm here to
change is your perspectives. Huh?

00:17:36.764 --> 00:17:39.475
You deweys are looking
at Christmas all wrong.

00:17:39.850 --> 00:17:41.269
Let me show you.

00:17:42.061 --> 00:17:43.813
(Thuds)

00:17:45.147 --> 00:17:46.607
And what do you see here,
big Dewey?

00:17:46.774 --> 00:17:49.652
Three starving people
in a hospital eating jell-o.

00:17:49.777 --> 00:17:50.778
Hm-hm.

00:17:50.861 --> 00:17:53.656
I see people making
the best of a bad situation.

00:17:53.739 --> 00:17:56.826
Ooh, almost midnight.
(Coah chuckles)

00:17:56.951 --> 00:18:01.122
And the man who made sure
no one spent Christmas alone.

00:18:01.455 --> 00:18:04.000
I'm sorry I ruined
your Christmas.

00:18:04.083 --> 00:18:05.376
Would've ruined it more if! Knew

00:18:05.459 --> 00:18:07.044
you were on your own, Dewey.

00:18:08.379 --> 00:18:09.380
Merry Christmas.

00:18:09.463 --> 00:18:11.507
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.

00:18:11.632 --> 00:18:13.342
(All chuckles)

00:18:13.426 --> 00:18:15.845
And you, medium Dewey.

00:18:20.516 --> 00:18:22.268
What do you see here?

00:18:22.393 --> 00:18:23.853
Two people who just got fired

00:18:23.978 --> 00:18:25.818
and are about to go home
and not exchange gifts

00:18:25.896 --> 00:18:27.398
because
they couldn't afford any.

00:18:27.481 --> 00:18:29.281
Good luck putting
a silver lining on that one.

00:18:29.317 --> 00:18:30.693
You are right, medium Dewey.

00:18:30.776 --> 00:18:33.487
This Christmas was not so great.

00:18:34.655 --> 00:18:36.324
But it was not all bad.

00:18:36.407 --> 00:18:37.825
Hey, ready to go?

00:18:37.908 --> 00:18:39.493
I have a surprise.

00:18:42.330 --> 00:18:43.623
A holiday cheeseball.

00:18:43.789 --> 00:18:45.642
Someone asked me to wrap one
and then forgot to pick it up.

00:18:45.666 --> 00:18:46.792
Come on, dig in.

00:18:47.793 --> 00:18:49.378
You do not have much,

00:18:49.962 --> 00:18:52.298
but you have
two parents who love you.

00:18:52.506 --> 00:18:54.425
And that's not nothing.

00:18:54.634 --> 00:18:55.926
(All chuckles)

00:18:56.510 --> 00:18:57.595
(Switches off light)

00:18:59.639 --> 00:19:02.433
Ooh, it's my turn.
What do I get to see?

00:19:02.516 --> 00:19:04.101
I do not know, tiny Dewey.

00:19:04.185 --> 00:19:05.936
Deweys: Easy with the tiny.

00:19:06.395 --> 00:19:07.563
(Chuckles softly)

00:19:07.647 --> 00:19:10.316
This Christmas
has not happened yet.

00:19:10.524 --> 00:19:12.985
You are where it all begins.

00:19:13.110 --> 00:19:15.738
You can choose to keep things
as they are

00:19:15.863 --> 00:19:20.242
or change the course of your
Christmas futures forever.

00:19:20.618 --> 00:19:22.286
Itsahuptoyounow, buddy.

00:19:22.411 --> 00:19:23.704
We believe in you.

00:19:24.455 --> 00:19:27.958
Now it's time for you
to get back to bed.

00:19:28.584 --> 00:19:30.670
It's almost Christmas morning.

00:19:30.753 --> 00:19:35.675
(Gentle festive music)

00:19:36.967 --> 00:19:39.512
What day is it?
You there, what day is it?

00:19:41.347 --> 00:19:43.140
Couldn't say, little man.

00:19:43.265 --> 00:19:45.226
Merry Christmas, baby.

00:19:45.476 --> 00:19:47.103
Do you wanna open your present?

00:19:49.438 --> 00:19:50.481
Open it up, son.

00:19:52.566 --> 00:19:55.111
(Paper rumbling)

00:19:56.237 --> 00:19:57.697
A radish baby.

00:19:59.699 --> 00:20:00.908
I love it!

00:20:01.409 --> 00:20:03.536
Oh, I'm so glad. (Chuckles)

00:20:03.619 --> 00:20:04.704
It was sold out everywhere.

00:20:04.787 --> 00:20:06.306
But luckily, your dad knew
a guy who knew a guy...

00:20:06.330 --> 00:20:07.970
Thank you guys so much
for looking so hard

00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:09.125
for my Christmas present.

00:20:09.208 --> 00:20:10.334
I'm really lucky.

00:20:11.919 --> 00:20:13.796
Merry Christmas.

00:20:13.879 --> 00:20:16.716
Rocky, I know
you didn't get any last night.

00:20:16.799 --> 00:20:18.217
Thanks, Lia.

00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:19.427
Aw, wow.

00:20:19.510 --> 00:20:21.470
Hey, get back. Get outta here.

00:20:22.888 --> 00:20:24.181
Rocky, it's Christmas.

00:20:25.766 --> 00:20:26.767
(Grunts)

00:20:28.644 --> 00:20:30.414
Thanks for teaching me
the meaning of Christmas

00:20:30.438 --> 00:20:31.439
via time travel.

00:20:31.731 --> 00:20:33.023
Is it Christmas?

00:20:33.107 --> 00:20:34.150
Yeah.

00:20:35.151 --> 00:20:36.610
Merry Christmas.

00:20:36.819 --> 00:20:38.988
All: Merry Christmas.

00:20:39.113 --> 00:20:40.614
Pere Noel taught me

00:20:40.698 --> 00:20:43.033
that Christmas
is what we make of it.

00:20:43.117 --> 00:20:44.910
And the most important thing
about our movie

00:20:44.994 --> 00:20:46.495
isn't whether
or not it makes sense

00:20:46.579 --> 00:20:48.998
that big Tim
needs Santa's sleigh

00:20:49.081 --> 00:20:52.209
to stop Ibiza scrooge
from blowing up New Orleans.

00:20:52.334 --> 00:20:54.086
The most important thing
about our movie

00:20:54.170 --> 00:20:55.838
is that families
will go see it together.

00:20:56.505 --> 00:20:57.590
You're right.

00:20:57.673 --> 00:21:00.050
It reminds me
of when I was a kid,

00:21:00.134 --> 00:21:02.636
and my family would go
to the movies on Christmas.

00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:05.264
And after, we'd drive
home and criticize

00:21:05.389 --> 00:21:07.099
all our neighbors' decorations.

00:21:07.183 --> 00:21:09.059
(Laughs) It was really nice.

00:21:09.185 --> 00:21:11.645
You see, now that's what
Christmas is all about.

00:21:11.771 --> 00:21:13.981
Those shared memories
that people will take with them

00:21:14.064 --> 00:21:15.232
for the rest of their lives.

00:21:15.316 --> 00:21:16.817
Because love it or hate it,

00:21:16.901 --> 00:21:18.944
this time of the year
is really special.

00:21:19.236 --> 00:21:20.529
Now, I don't know about you,

00:21:20.613 --> 00:21:22.907
but I don't wanna live
in a world without Christmas.

00:21:24.575 --> 00:21:26.786
Let's go save Christmas!

00:21:29.288 --> 00:21:31.791
Merry Christmas, everyone.

00:21:33.125 --> 00:21:35.127
Hey, Rudolph. (Grunts)

00:21:35.211 --> 00:21:37.213
Light the way to bourbon
street. (Grunts)

00:21:37.463 --> 00:21:38.547
(Gun cocks)

00:21:38.923 --> 00:21:40.341
And cut. (Bell rings)

00:21:40.424 --> 00:21:42.927
That's great.
Fantastic work, people.

00:21:43.052 --> 00:21:45.471
Leslie, that was amazing.
Greatjob.

00:21:45.554 --> 00:21:47.973
Thanks to you.
You're a regular pere Noel.

00:21:48.098 --> 00:21:49.558
I prefer dwanta claus.

00:21:49.642 --> 00:21:50.726
(Laughter)

00:21:51.936 --> 00:21:53.562
Look at howjacked we are.

00:21:53.729 --> 00:21:55.606
So that's us at 40.

00:21:55.689 --> 00:21:57.817
Why would we ever wear a shirt?

00:21:57.942 --> 00:21:59.026
I think that's a good idea.
