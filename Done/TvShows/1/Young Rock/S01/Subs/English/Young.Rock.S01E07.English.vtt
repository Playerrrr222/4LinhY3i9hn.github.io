WEBVTT

00:00:05.047 --> 00:00:06.798
(News music playing)

00:00:08.008 --> 00:00:09.801
Good evening. I'm Randall park.

00:00:09.927 --> 00:00:12.346
Candidate Dwayne Johnson
finds himself embroiled

00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:14.515
in controversy today
over the announcement

00:00:14.598 --> 00:00:16.308
of his vice presidential
running mate,

00:00:16.558 --> 00:00:18.268
general Monica Jackson.

00:00:18.435 --> 00:00:19.520
As a west point cadet,

00:00:19.603 --> 00:00:21.730
general Jackson wrote
a weekly humor column

00:00:21.813 --> 00:00:24.191
for the school newspaper
called just joking,

00:00:24.274 --> 00:00:25.651
where she offered up

00:00:25.734 --> 00:00:28.320
"witticisms
of mass destruction".

00:00:28.737 --> 00:00:29.821
Yeah.

00:00:29.905 --> 00:00:32.533
Randall, we have vetted
general Jackson thoroughly,

00:00:32.616 --> 00:00:33.992
and I've seen her column.

00:00:34.076 --> 00:00:35.118
Even this one,

00:00:35.244 --> 00:00:38.497
where she calls UN
secretary general kofi annan

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:40.123
"a weak cup of kofi"?

00:00:40.415 --> 00:00:41.893
Look, clearly she's not
my running mate

00:00:41.917 --> 00:00:43.085
for her sense of humor.

00:00:43.335 --> 00:00:46.088
She's here because we have
a shared vision for the country.

00:00:46.171 --> 00:00:47.851
Well, as someone who's
familiar with comedy

00:00:47.923 --> 00:00:49.174
from my acting days,

00:00:49.258 --> 00:00:50.968
I know how polarizing it can be.

00:00:51.385 --> 00:00:52.594
Amy polarizing.

00:00:53.136 --> 00:00:55.097
(Laughs) That's good! Yeah.

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:57.015
That is good. Get in
here. That's good. Okay.

00:00:57.099 --> 00:00:58.642
Thank you so much.
You're welcome.

00:00:58.725 --> 00:01:00.519
Awesome. Uh, where you going?

00:01:01.603 --> 00:01:03.164
We still have an interview,
I think, right?

00:01:03.188 --> 00:01:05.857
Oh, oh, sorry. No, I...
I... I just got excited.

00:01:05.941 --> 00:01:07.025
Caught up in the moment.

00:01:07.109 --> 00:01:08.151
Yeah. It was a good joke.

00:01:08.235 --> 00:01:09.278
Thank you, thank you.

00:01:09.361 --> 00:01:11.738
Anyway, so certain factions
are calling on you

00:01:11.822 --> 00:01:13.490
to choose a new running mate,

00:01:13.574 --> 00:01:15.284
saying that Jackson
lacks the credibility

00:01:15.367 --> 00:01:16.410
to be vice president.

00:01:16.493 --> 00:01:18.287
Look, she's still my partner
in this thing,

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:20.163
and I don't leave
my partners behind.

00:01:20.247 --> 00:01:21.999
Mmm. Hopkins taught me that one.

00:01:22.124 --> 00:01:23.208
Hopkins? Yeah.

00:01:23.292 --> 00:01:24.835
Yes, yes, Hopkins, Hopkins.

00:01:24.918 --> 00:01:27.212
Your costar
in the scorpion king, right?

00:01:27.296 --> 00:01:28.672
No one named Hopkins
on that one.

00:01:28.755 --> 00:01:31.341
Right, no, no.
That's not Hopkins.

00:01:32.134 --> 00:01:33.552
Hopkins was...

00:01:33.635 --> 00:01:34.779
You know, Randall,
it might be easier

00:01:34.803 --> 00:01:36.013
if I just told you the story.

00:01:37.055 --> 00:01:38.223
Right. (Laughs)

00:01:38.307 --> 00:01:40.892
1991, I was playing football
for the university of Miami.

00:01:40.976 --> 00:01:42.328
(Music playing) Man:
(Rapping) Miami bass, bass, bass

00:01:42.352 --> 00:01:43.496
adult Dwayne: So I've been open

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.148
about how badly I handled
my first semester of college,

00:01:46.815 --> 00:01:49.151
getting injured and almost
flunking out of school.

00:01:49.901 --> 00:01:51.570
I was spending
the off-season rehabbing

00:01:51.653 --> 00:01:53.155
and getting myself back on track

00:01:53.238 --> 00:01:56.241
and ready for a new season
with new teammates.

00:01:56.408 --> 00:01:57.868
You Dwayne Johnson?

00:01:58.076 --> 00:02:00.287
Yeah, who's asking?

00:02:00.954 --> 00:02:03.415
Warren sapp, freshman tight end.

00:02:03.498 --> 00:02:06.251
Miami bass, bass, bass, bass

00:02:06.752 --> 00:02:08.170
future bench-press
record holder.

00:02:08.587 --> 00:02:10.213
Oh, you think you got it?

00:02:10.297 --> 00:02:12.007
Man, get your sharpie
ready. (Laughs)

00:02:12.174 --> 00:02:13.800
Okay, freshman.
I don't want no excuses.

00:02:13.884 --> 00:02:15.164
I know you already been working.

00:02:15.218 --> 00:02:16.404
Don't worry. You won't hear any.

00:02:16.428 --> 00:02:18.680
Uh-huh. Let's get it.

00:02:18.764 --> 00:02:19.765
(Grunts)

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:22.434
This is so easy. So easy.

00:02:22.517 --> 00:02:24.728
I'm thinking about what
I'm about to have for lunch.

00:02:24.811 --> 00:02:26.563
I wish I had a book.
I'd start reading it.

00:02:26.688 --> 00:02:27.957
Adult Dwayne: I was
feeling strong,

00:02:27.981 --> 00:02:29.900
couldn't wait
for the next season to start.

00:02:29.983 --> 00:02:31.193
My parents were so excited,

00:02:31.276 --> 00:02:33.487
they even watched tapes
of our practice scrimmages.

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:35.405
Whoo-hoo!
Something happen on that play?

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:36.948
Yes, Dewey didn't get hurt!

00:02:38.784 --> 00:02:42.829
Ooh, you know! Yeah,
you like that, Dewey?

00:02:43.121 --> 00:02:44.373
What about this?

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:51.588
You know what those grades mean?

00:02:51.672 --> 00:02:53.382
You're still
on academic probation.

00:02:53.715 --> 00:02:55.818
Coach 0, how did you get
my grades? Aren't they private?

00:02:55.842 --> 00:02:58.637
Nothing's private from me,
son. This ain't no joke now.

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.889
Not only do you need to get
these grades up,

00:03:00.972 --> 00:03:02.367
you need to show the school
your appreciativeness

00:03:02.391 --> 00:03:03.725
to even letting you play.

00:03:03.809 --> 00:03:05.286
Like compliment them
on the renovations

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.270
they made to
the administration building.

00:03:08.105 --> 00:03:10.982
You are making me
so mad, Dwayne.

00:03:12.901 --> 00:03:14.277
You need to volunteer.

00:03:14.361 --> 00:03:16.738
Do something to help
the university.

00:03:16.822 --> 00:03:18.342
Show them your dedication
to the school

00:03:18.407 --> 00:03:19.700
goes beyond football.

00:03:19.866 --> 00:03:20.992
Here.

00:03:23.036 --> 00:03:24.121
Call this guy.

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:26.329
Tell him you want to help out
with campus security.

00:03:26.498 --> 00:03:28.750
This is real important,
Dewey. You can't mess this up.

00:03:29.084 --> 00:03:30.460
Uh, coach, this is your card.

00:03:31.002 --> 00:03:32.671
What? Oh.

00:03:32.754 --> 00:03:34.172
Kind of looks like me, don't it?

00:03:34.965 --> 00:03:37.384
Yeah, I found that
on the clip art.

00:03:37.634 --> 00:03:39.052
There, that face.

00:03:39.136 --> 00:03:40.655
Adult Dwayne: While I
was doing whatever! Had to

00:03:40.679 --> 00:03:41.972
to keep playing football,

00:03:42.055 --> 00:03:43.932
my grandmother was returning
to the u. S.

00:03:44.015 --> 00:03:47.102
After years of exile in Samoa.

00:03:47.227 --> 00:03:48.496
Could you take
your hat off, please?

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:50.313
Why? It's obscuring your face.

00:03:50.605 --> 00:03:52.607
Are you hitting on me? Ma'am.

00:03:53.108 --> 00:03:54.151
Fine.

00:03:54.651 --> 00:03:55.986
And where are you coming from?

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:59.281
Where am I coming from?
Hell, that's where.

00:03:59.364 --> 00:04:01.074
Lia: For almost
two years in Samoa,

00:04:01.283 --> 00:04:04.161
I was homeless and sleeping
on people's couches,

00:04:04.536 --> 00:04:07.622
and at night, I would stare
up in the stars,

00:04:07.706 --> 00:04:09.958
thinking about getting back
to my family,

00:04:10.041 --> 00:04:12.836
and then one day I heard
from my daughter.

00:04:12.919 --> 00:04:15.422
She told me that my grandson
had found a way

00:04:15.505 --> 00:04:17.299
to get me back into the country.

00:04:17.382 --> 00:04:19.009
My prayers had been answered.

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:23.430
Okay, so,
under "countries visited,"

00:04:23.513 --> 00:04:25.223
I'm just gonna put Samoa.

00:04:27.893 --> 00:04:29.227
Idiot.

00:04:29.811 --> 00:04:31.563
Stupid.

00:04:32.063 --> 00:04:33.398
Okay, wait. I'm confused.

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:35.609
How did you get her back
into the country

00:04:35.692 --> 00:04:37.492
if she was deported
by the federal government?

00:04:37.569 --> 00:04:40.363
Let's just say that I found
a little loophole in the law,

00:04:40.447 --> 00:04:42.199
and she became a citizen again.

00:04:42.532 --> 00:04:43.992
Can I ask a follow-up question?

00:04:44.075 --> 00:04:45.535
I wouldn't. Just a quick one.

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:47.138
Was Hopkins somehow involved
in all that?

00:04:47.162 --> 00:04:49.581
No, he wasn't.
I hadn't met Hopkins yet.

00:04:49.748 --> 00:04:50.791
I was about to.

00:04:50.874 --> 00:04:52.594
Adult Dwayne:
Coach's contact pulled through

00:04:52.626 --> 00:04:54.503
and helped me get a job
in campus security

00:04:54.711 --> 00:04:57.047
in a department called
"phone services".

00:04:57.255 --> 00:04:59.674
You'll be checking
the emergency phones on campus

00:04:59.758 --> 00:05:01.051
to make sure
they're operational.

00:05:01.176 --> 00:05:03.279
Okay, so I just have to...
Don't worry, I'm gonna have one

00:05:03.303 --> 00:05:05.472
of our most experienced
techs train you.

00:05:06.097 --> 00:05:07.474
Hopkins!

00:05:10.936 --> 00:05:12.938
Hopkins! Hopkins!

00:05:13.021 --> 00:05:14.248
That's Hopkins. That's Hopkins.

00:05:14.272 --> 00:05:15.732
Come on, give me some.

00:05:15.816 --> 00:05:17.818
(Laughs) All right, yes!

00:05:17.901 --> 00:05:19.378
Where you going? We're
still doing the interview.

00:05:19.402 --> 00:05:20.797
Oh, that's right.
You're totally right.

00:05:20.821 --> 00:05:21.901
That's right. That's right.

00:05:22.072 --> 00:05:23.657
There we go.
Okay, sorry about that.

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:24.991
Itsokay justgotexcned.

00:05:25.075 --> 00:05:27.077
It's Hopkins. Hopkins!

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:29.871
Hopkins, this is your new
partner, Dwayne Johnson.

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:31.873
I don't need a partner.
I'm good, thanks.

00:05:31.957 --> 00:05:34.626
This isn't a choice, Hopkins.
This is an assignment.

00:05:36.795 --> 00:05:38.338
Get somebody else to take him.

00:05:38.672 --> 00:05:39.992
I've got seniority,
for god sakes.

00:05:40.382 --> 00:05:41.883
Come on.

00:05:41.967 --> 00:05:42.968
Show Dwayne the ropes.

00:05:44.719 --> 00:05:46.471
Just eight months to graduation.

00:05:48.098 --> 00:05:49.242
So we just check
the phone and...

00:05:49.266 --> 00:05:51.685
Okay, here's the deal.
None of that matters. All right?

00:05:51.768 --> 00:05:53.928
We write our names on that
sign-in sheet every morning,

00:05:53.979 --> 00:05:55.748
get the list of phones
we're supposed to check,

00:05:55.772 --> 00:05:57.708
then go home and watch movies
until it's time to sign out.

00:05:57.732 --> 00:05:59.359
What? But Justin said that...

00:05:59.442 --> 00:06:02.320
He has to say that,
but he knows the deal.

00:06:02.404 --> 00:06:03.488
We look out for each other.

00:06:03.697 --> 00:06:05.866
Now that I've told you,
you're a part of that circle.

00:06:05.949 --> 00:06:08.702
Look, this job is keeping
me on the football field.

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:11.121
If you're messing with my
chances to get to the NFL,

00:06:11.496 --> 00:06:12.539
I will kill you.

00:06:12.622 --> 00:06:14.624
Just take it easy,
big fella, all right?

00:06:14.708 --> 00:06:16.668
Just follow my lead,
and everything will be fine.

00:06:17.168 --> 00:06:20.130
The only thing I need to know
is, do you like action movies?

00:06:20.213 --> 00:06:21.756
Of course I like action movies.

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:24.175
Then welcome to the
greatest scam in college history.

00:06:27.679 --> 00:06:29.139
(Sirens wailing on TV)

00:06:29.472 --> 00:06:31.641
Hopkins: Whoa!
Yo, you sure about this?

00:06:31.725 --> 00:06:33.894
We just watch movies and
then go back and sign out

00:06:33.977 --> 00:06:35.145
at the end of our shift?

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:37.206
You sure we don't have
to check any campus phones?

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:39.733
Look here, man. I used to check
the phones like a good soldier

00:06:39.816 --> 00:06:42.110
my first few months here,
and you know what I found?

00:06:42.319 --> 00:06:44.696
They worked. If they
don't, somebody'd tell us.

00:06:44.779 --> 00:06:46.740
We're entirely unnecessary.

00:06:46.823 --> 00:06:50.076
Trust me, I've been doing this
a long time, almost a year.

00:06:53.204 --> 00:06:54.497
(Gun firing on TV)

00:06:55.457 --> 00:06:57.000
(Chuckles) This flick is good.

00:06:57.334 --> 00:06:58.835
Not as good
as Schwarzenegger's...

00:06:58.919 --> 00:07:00.253
Best action star of all time.

00:07:00.337 --> 00:07:02.213
No, Stallone, all day.

00:07:02.297 --> 00:07:03.965
This isn't a debate.
It's a fact.

00:07:04.049 --> 00:07:07.177
Uh, it's a fact that my guy
could take your guy

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.596
via land, sea, air, and time.

00:07:09.971 --> 00:07:11.251
Say your daughter gets kidnapped

00:07:11.306 --> 00:07:13.058
by a Latin American dictator.
Okay.

00:07:13.141 --> 00:07:15.435
You can send one guy to
save her, who do you pick?

00:07:15.518 --> 00:07:16.561
Rambo. Mmm-mmm.

00:07:16.645 --> 00:07:18.438
He's experienced
in tropical environments.

00:07:18.521 --> 00:07:20.023
He's escaped a pow camp.

00:07:20.106 --> 00:07:21.858
He knows how to deal
with a loose Cannon.

00:07:21.942 --> 00:07:24.694
Rambo knows Vietnam.
He doesn't know South America.

00:07:24.861 --> 00:07:26.321
And, yeah, he escaped
a pow camp,

00:07:26.404 --> 00:07:27.882
but he lost his best friends
in the process.

00:07:27.906 --> 00:07:29.240
'Cause he was double-crossed!

00:07:29.449 --> 00:07:30.676
Schwarzenegger
doesn't make excuses.

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:32.260
Oh, but I'm sure you will
for red Sonja.

00:07:32.452 --> 00:07:34.871
Two beautiful foreigners
with swords getting revenge?

00:07:35.205 --> 00:07:36.247
I don't see a problem.

00:07:36.581 --> 00:07:37.707
(Bomb exploding on TV) Ooh!

00:07:40.085 --> 00:07:41.127
Here we are!

00:07:42.671 --> 00:07:44.965
(Grunts) Why are these so heavy?

00:07:45.048 --> 00:07:46.758
It's the wood for my carvings.

00:07:47.175 --> 00:07:49.177
So, we have a surprise.

00:07:49.344 --> 00:07:50.762
We've called some
of the old crew,

00:07:50.845 --> 00:07:52.138
and they're all coming to town.

00:07:52.222 --> 00:07:54.057
We're throwing you a
barbecue this weekend.

00:07:54.516 --> 00:07:55.850
Who's gonna man the grill?

00:07:56.643 --> 00:07:58.186
Why is that everyone's
first question?

00:07:58.269 --> 00:07:59.854
Who cares who mans the grill?

00:08:00.689 --> 00:08:02.607
Ah, Dewey.

00:08:02.691 --> 00:08:04.401
I can't wait to see him.

00:08:04.651 --> 00:08:06.331
Won't be long
before you're able to see him

00:08:06.361 --> 00:08:08.571
play football on TV on Saturday.

00:08:08.738 --> 00:08:10.740
You hear that, high chief?

00:08:10.865 --> 00:08:14.703
Your grandson, big star,
playing football on TV.

00:08:14.995 --> 00:08:15.996
How much he get paid?

00:08:16.579 --> 00:08:18.139
Nothing. They don't
get paid in college.

00:08:18.331 --> 00:08:21.459
Stupid. You made me bore
the high chief with stupid news?

00:08:21.543 --> 00:08:23.503
You know how busy he is
in heaven?

00:08:23.878 --> 00:08:25.588
Schwarzenegger on TV:
You son of a bitch.

00:08:28.299 --> 00:08:31.469
He's no Stallone, but your guy
Schwarzenegger can deliver a catchphrase.

00:08:31.594 --> 00:08:32.679
Hell, yeah, he can.

00:08:32.846 --> 00:08:34.657
(Imitates Schwarzenegger)
Get to the chopper. Get to the chopper.

00:08:34.681 --> 00:08:36.433
Get to the chopper.
Get to the chopper.

00:08:36.516 --> 00:08:38.518
Get to the chopper!
Get to the chopper!

00:08:38.601 --> 00:08:40.145
Yeah!

00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:42.123
Hopkins: Oh, there it is,
there it is. It's coming, it's coming.

00:08:42.147 --> 00:08:44.065
Oh! Yes!

00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:46.943
(The touch by Stan bush playing)

00:08:53.199 --> 00:08:54.635
(Young Dwayne laughs)
Hopkins: Watch this.

00:08:54.659 --> 00:08:56.202
Hopkins: Oh! Ahhh!

00:08:56.286 --> 00:08:57.579
(Both laughing)

00:08:57.704 --> 00:09:00.415
You've never walked
you've never run

00:09:00.498 --> 00:09:03.460
you're a winner

00:09:03.543 --> 00:09:04.854
Schwarzenegger:
Kill me! I'm here!

00:09:04.878 --> 00:09:07.338
Come on, do it now! Kill me!

00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:09.549
(Yells)

00:09:09.632 --> 00:09:11.676
(Laughs)

00:09:11.968 --> 00:09:13.470
You have to cut the ground wire.

00:09:13.553 --> 00:09:16.473
It's the blue wire
with the white stripe.

00:09:16.556 --> 00:09:19.142
You got the power

00:09:19.267 --> 00:09:20.310
yes!

00:09:20.393 --> 00:09:21.394
You got the touch

00:09:23.188 --> 00:09:24.856
you see, the mud
is what protects you.

00:09:24.939 --> 00:09:27.067
No, I don't... iwould've
seen him regardless.

00:09:27.317 --> 00:09:29.086
It's invisibility.
You would not have seen him.

00:09:29.110 --> 00:09:30.504
Young Dwayne:
Bro, you don't know my powers.

00:09:30.528 --> 00:09:33.865
Says here all the phones
are in working order.

00:09:34.449 --> 00:09:35.533
You sure about that?

00:09:35.617 --> 00:09:36.868
Of course we're sure.

00:09:37.452 --> 00:09:39.180
Young Dwayne: I was gonna say,
"we have total recall."

00:09:39.204 --> 00:09:40.997
Here you go. Young
Dwayne: That's hilarious.

00:09:42.749 --> 00:09:44.167
Have a good one.

00:09:47.128 --> 00:09:48.963
You guys better hope
those phones are working.

00:09:49.047 --> 00:09:51.841
That was Amanda Chavez from
hq. She's doing quality control.

00:09:51.966 --> 00:09:53.802
What do you mean
quality control?

00:09:53.885 --> 00:09:55.553
She's checking the phones.

00:09:55.637 --> 00:09:56.679
She's got your checklist,

00:09:56.763 --> 00:09:58.157
and she's gonna
make sure it's accurate.

00:09:58.181 --> 00:10:00.433
You said no one ever checks.
They don't.

00:10:00.517 --> 00:10:02.519
They never do.
Well, they are now.

00:10:02.602 --> 00:10:04.270
Amanda Chavez is checking
your work,

00:10:04.354 --> 00:10:05.980
and if anything's off,
we're all screwed.

00:10:06.231 --> 00:10:07.398
Oh, I can't mess this up.

00:10:07.524 --> 00:10:10.193
My football career, my life
is on the line.

00:10:10.276 --> 00:10:11.945
And I'm saving up
for a sega Genesis.

00:10:12.445 --> 00:10:13.672
Then you need to get
to those phones

00:10:13.696 --> 00:10:15.532
before Amanda Chavez does.

00:10:18.409 --> 00:10:19.869
Do not screw this up!

00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:23.748
God help us if Chavez is
wearing her comfortable heels.

00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:27.293
(Birds chirping)

00:10:28.169 --> 00:10:29.546
(Dramatic music playing)

00:10:29.629 --> 00:10:31.214
Move, move, move, move!

00:10:31.297 --> 00:10:32.507
Whoa! Excuse me!

00:10:33.716 --> 00:10:35.218
Sorry, sorry!

00:10:35.301 --> 00:10:37.387
(Birds chirping)

00:10:39.139 --> 00:10:40.419
She's halfway
to the first phone.

00:10:41.099 --> 00:10:43.035
How are we gonna beat her
there without her seeing us?

00:10:43.059 --> 00:10:45.228
What if we go this way?
Jump the arboretum wall?

00:10:45.311 --> 00:10:46.413
That bitch is eight feet high!

00:10:46.437 --> 00:10:47.915
Or we could go
through the natatorium.

00:10:47.939 --> 00:10:49.416
Pool. Man, the lifeguards
will make us walk.

00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:50.918
Well, the arboretum
or the natatorium?

00:10:50.942 --> 00:10:52.861
The arboretum or the natatorium?

00:10:52.944 --> 00:10:54.195
Make the call! The arboretum!

00:10:54.279 --> 00:10:55.488
Okay.

00:10:55.572 --> 00:10:56.823
(Grunts)

00:10:58.283 --> 00:10:59.617
(Birds chirping)

00:11:01.035 --> 00:11:02.395
(Line trilling)
All right, itworks.

00:11:03.496 --> 00:11:05.456
Hey, Hopkins, look.

00:11:06.332 --> 00:11:07.476
Hopkins: What's
she doing over there?

00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:08.585
She changed her route.

00:11:08.668 --> 00:11:10.503
She's headed to the phone
by the library.

00:11:14.549 --> 00:11:15.550
Hopkins: Damn it!

00:11:15.633 --> 00:11:17.278
It doesn't make any sense.
Why would she do that?

00:11:17.302 --> 00:11:18.720
We're dealing
with a loose Cannon.

00:11:18.803 --> 00:11:21.323
Hopkins: She's heading to the
phone on the other side of the Plaza.

00:11:21.347 --> 00:11:23.683
She's almost there. What do we
do? (Marching band playing)

00:11:24.684 --> 00:11:25.852
Igotanidea.

00:11:25.935 --> 00:11:28.271
You move those cones and
reroute the band to block her.

00:11:28.354 --> 00:11:30.434
I'm gonna cut through the
building to beat her there.

00:11:30.857 --> 00:11:33.651
(Marching band playing)

00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:46.289
Oh, uh...

00:11:48.708 --> 00:11:50.501
(Humming)

00:11:51.753 --> 00:11:53.588
It's up to you now, Johnson.

00:11:53.922 --> 00:11:57.884
Today we're gonna be talking
about electromagnetic force.

00:11:57.967 --> 00:12:00.845
(Dramatic music playing)

00:12:01.054 --> 00:12:02.972
Excuse me, can we help you?

00:12:03.097 --> 00:12:04.682
Uh, no need, all good.

00:12:04.807 --> 00:12:06.226
What is your name?

00:12:06.434 --> 00:12:07.602
Warren sapp!

00:12:08.436 --> 00:12:11.439
(Holding out for a hero
by Bonnie Tyler playing)

00:12:12.857 --> 00:12:14.901
(Line trilling)

00:12:21.658 --> 00:12:24.661
Where have all the good
men gone?

00:12:24.744 --> 00:12:27.622
And where are all the gods?

00:12:27.705 --> 00:12:29.290
Where's the streetwise Hercules

00:12:29.374 --> 00:12:30.458
(line trilling)

00:12:30.541 --> 00:12:32.710
To fight the rising odds?

00:12:34.462 --> 00:12:39.676
Isn't there a white knight
upon a fiery steed?

00:12:39.759 --> 00:12:40.760
(Line trilling)

00:12:40.843 --> 00:12:43.221
Late at night, I toss and I turn

00:12:43.304 --> 00:12:45.848
and I dream of what I need

00:12:46.307 --> 00:12:48.351
I need a hero

00:12:48.685 --> 00:12:52.689
I'm holding out for a hero
till the morning light

00:12:52.855 --> 00:12:55.650
he's got to be sure
and it's got to be soon

00:12:55.733 --> 00:12:58.528
and he's got to be larger
than life

00:12:58.653 --> 00:12:59.988
Hopkins. What?

00:13:00.071 --> 00:13:01.281
Put your feet down.

00:13:03.741 --> 00:13:04.951
Oh. (Chuckles)

00:13:09.455 --> 00:13:12.125
(Laughing)

00:13:12.458 --> 00:13:14.585
Thank you, baby. Thank you.

00:13:14.669 --> 00:13:15.878
I know this sounds crazy,

00:13:15.962 --> 00:13:17.602
but I think I might grill up
some peaches.

00:13:17.630 --> 00:13:19.132
(Cheers)

00:13:19.215 --> 00:13:21.926
Is she making peach burgers?
Mmm-hmm.

00:13:22.010 --> 00:13:24.387
Lia, you wouldn't believe
how much beefjerky

00:13:24.470 --> 00:13:26.806
they make me eat when I shoot
one of those commercials.

00:13:26.889 --> 00:13:28.308
(Chuckles) Guess how much.

00:13:28.975 --> 00:13:30.018
One hundred pounds?

00:13:30.101 --> 00:13:31.602
One hundred p...

00:13:31.728 --> 00:13:33.354
No, now, that is a crazy
amount ofjerky.

00:13:34.147 --> 00:13:36.274
Thirty-eight sticks, yeah.

00:13:36.357 --> 00:13:37.442
Ooh. Thirty-eight.

00:13:37.525 --> 00:13:39.694
I once ate 38 eggs in a day.

00:13:39.777 --> 00:13:42.113
Ah, well, there ain't no
money in eggs, my brother,

00:13:42.196 --> 00:13:45.700
but beefjerky did pay
for my iambo.

00:13:47.618 --> 00:13:49.120
Ran dy: Ooh, yeah!

00:13:49.287 --> 00:13:51.414
Billy crystal told me to
buy two lamborghinis

00:13:51.581 --> 00:13:53.624
and use them as roller skates.
(All laughing)

00:13:53.708 --> 00:13:55.460
Sylvester: I'm so glad
you called me, Lia.

00:13:55.543 --> 00:13:58.463
I didn't think you were ever gonna
forgive me for going with Greg yao.

00:13:58.546 --> 00:13:59.672
It's funny.

00:13:59.797 --> 00:14:02.342
I used to care about things
like that,

00:14:02.592 --> 00:14:05.636
but my time in Samoa... (Sighs)

00:14:05.887 --> 00:14:08.306
Mom, you get the first burger
off the grill.

00:14:09.223 --> 00:14:11.559
Thank you, darling.
I'm not hungry.

00:14:12.393 --> 00:14:14.896
You okay, Lia?
You don't seem like yourself.

00:14:14.979 --> 00:14:16.064
What's the matter?

00:14:16.147 --> 00:14:19.442
(Sighs) Me. I'm the matter.

00:14:19.567 --> 00:14:21.944
In Samoa, I had a
lot of time to think,

00:14:22.111 --> 00:14:25.490
and I realized the most
important thing is family.

00:14:25.907 --> 00:14:27.617
Nothing else matters.

00:14:27.867 --> 00:14:29.994
Now that I've come home,

00:14:30.536 --> 00:14:32.622
I see how I failed my family.

00:14:33.164 --> 00:14:34.457
Mama, you didn't fail us.

00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:37.251
I wanted to keep
Peter's dream alive,

00:14:37.335 --> 00:14:40.546
his business was our legacy.
And I didn't do that.

00:14:40.838 --> 00:14:42.465
He shouldn't have left it to me.

00:14:42.548 --> 00:14:43.984
Oh, no, don't say that.
Don't say that.

00:14:44.008 --> 00:14:45.468
No, it's true.

00:14:45.551 --> 00:14:49.097
I mean, we live in a
two-bedroom apartment in tonka.

00:14:49.180 --> 00:14:50.598
Tampa. Andre: Lia.

00:14:50.681 --> 00:14:53.726
You gave me a place to stay
when I had nowhere else to go.

00:14:53.810 --> 00:14:54.894
I'll never forget that.

00:14:54.977 --> 00:14:57.814
Playing cards in your kitchen was
some of the best times of my life.

00:14:58.064 --> 00:15:00.441
Auntie, you loaned us money
and helped us get started,

00:15:00.525 --> 00:15:02.777
remember?
And I completely betrayed you,

00:15:03.069 --> 00:15:04.463
but you still found it
in your heart

00:15:04.487 --> 00:15:05.905
to welcome me back
to the family.

00:15:06.114 --> 00:15:07.532
When Peter was alive,

00:15:08.157 --> 00:15:10.159
I never did see
the wrestling business as his.

00:15:10.243 --> 00:15:12.787
He needed you, baba,
same as you needed him.

00:15:12.870 --> 00:15:15.415
Peter would have been proud
of the way you fought for us.

00:15:16.874 --> 00:15:18.584
To Lia and Peter.

00:15:18.668 --> 00:15:20.962
All: Lia and Peter.

00:15:21.671 --> 00:15:23.005
Thank you, boys.

00:15:23.089 --> 00:15:25.591
Now, can someone get me
a hamburger? I'm starving.

00:15:25.758 --> 00:15:27.176
Mom, your
hamburger's right here!

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:29.679
Oh, right, right, right.

00:15:30.430 --> 00:15:34.267
You know, I am full on the
love and the well wishes.

00:15:34.350 --> 00:15:36.978
(All laughing)

00:15:37.437 --> 00:15:38.980
Who wants a peach burger?

00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:41.607
Ata: Come on, Randy,
you get in there.

00:15:41.691 --> 00:15:44.318
(All laughing)

00:15:46.612 --> 00:15:47.780
Got eyes on Chavez.

00:15:47.864 --> 00:15:49.591
She stopped for a coffee break
at the student center.

00:15:49.615 --> 00:15:51.593
We should have plenty of time
to check this last phone.

00:15:51.617 --> 00:15:53.077
Let's get it done, son.
We got this.

00:15:53.161 --> 00:15:56.706
(Bicycle bell dings)
(Shouts in slow motion)

00:15:57.081 --> 00:15:59.333
(Slowed down) No!

00:16:01.377 --> 00:16:02.920
Hopkins, can you hear me?
(Groans)

00:16:03.004 --> 00:16:04.547
Hophns! Ihearyou, man!

00:16:04.630 --> 00:16:06.424
It's my leg, not my ears!

00:16:06.674 --> 00:16:08.259
Come on, get up. I can't.

00:16:08.384 --> 00:16:09.820
My leg is busted.
Just go, all right?

00:16:09.844 --> 00:16:11.364
Just leave me.
I'm not gonna leave you.

00:16:11.554 --> 00:16:13.764
Would tango leave
cash? You can't risk it.

00:16:13.890 --> 00:16:16.267
(Grunts) You need
this job for football.

00:16:16.350 --> 00:16:19.103
And you, you need
that sega Genesis.

00:16:19.228 --> 00:16:21.022
Now come on.

00:16:21.105 --> 00:16:23.900
(Dramatic rock music playing)

00:16:32.658 --> 00:16:35.161
(Breathing heavily)

00:16:36.037 --> 00:16:38.331
Phone services.
I'm commandeering this cart.

00:16:38.414 --> 00:16:41.375
(Dramatic music playing)

00:16:46.672 --> 00:16:49.342
Johnson, no, don't do it!
Don't do it! Are you crazy?

00:16:49.425 --> 00:16:50.510
Look out, look out!

00:16:50.593 --> 00:16:52.553
Oh! (Brakes squeak)

00:16:55.139 --> 00:16:57.141
(Line trilling) (Laughs)

00:16:57.225 --> 00:16:59.560
Yes! We did it.

00:17:00.186 --> 00:17:01.646
(Laughs)

00:17:01.729 --> 00:17:05.024
Oh, man, I'm thinking
we need to frame this.

00:17:05.983 --> 00:17:09.403
Wait. What the hell is that?

00:17:09.487 --> 00:17:10.905
There's one more phone,

00:17:10.988 --> 00:17:12.216
and it's in the student center.

00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:14.450
That's why Chavez
went there first.

00:17:14.617 --> 00:17:16.327
She wasn't on a coffee break.

00:17:16.410 --> 00:17:17.662
She went to check that phone.

00:17:18.704 --> 00:17:20.098
You need to get to it
before she does.

00:17:20.122 --> 00:17:21.207
There's no way.

00:17:21.290 --> 00:17:22.930
The path goes all the way
around the quad.

00:17:22.959 --> 00:17:24.043
It'll take ten minutes.

00:17:24.210 --> 00:17:25.753
Not if you cut across on foot.

00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:28.214
I've got my walkie. I'll be
with you the whole way.

00:17:31.592 --> 00:17:33.094
Phone steam ahead.

00:17:33.761 --> 00:17:35.596
What? It's word play.

00:17:53.531 --> 00:17:55.491
She hasn't checked it yet.

00:17:58.828 --> 00:18:00.538
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

00:18:00.830 --> 00:18:01.914
Damn it!

00:18:04.458 --> 00:18:06.627
Hopkins. Hopkins, you there?

00:18:06.919 --> 00:18:08.379
Johnson, what's happening
in there?

00:18:08.462 --> 00:18:11.257
The phone is dead.
I don't have much time.

00:18:11.507 --> 00:18:12.987
Chavez is almost done
with her coffee.

00:18:13.050 --> 00:18:14.468
Hang on, Johnson.

00:18:16.846 --> 00:18:18.681
Come on, pick up the phone.
(Phone ringing)

00:18:18.764 --> 00:18:20.266
Emergency services,
this is Justin.

00:18:20.349 --> 00:18:22.560
Justin, it's Hopkins.
We've got a broken phone.

00:18:22.643 --> 00:18:23.745
What do we do? I don't know.

00:18:23.769 --> 00:18:24.979
It could be a million things.

00:18:25.062 --> 00:18:26.182
Just give us a fix, damn it!

00:18:26.564 --> 00:18:29.358
Okay, look, nine times
out often, it's the wiring.

00:18:29.984 --> 00:18:31.736
Try to unscrew the receiver end.

00:18:32.361 --> 00:18:34.238
Johnson, unscrew the receiver.

00:18:34.488 --> 00:18:35.740
Right.

00:18:39.577 --> 00:18:40.911
Okay. What's next?

00:18:40.995 --> 00:18:42.747
There should be
four connected wires...

00:18:43.122 --> 00:18:46.000
Blue, white, orange, and black.

00:18:46.083 --> 00:18:47.209
Do you see those?

00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:48.794
Do you see four wires?

00:18:48.878 --> 00:18:51.505
Blue, white, orange, and black.

00:18:52.089 --> 00:18:53.924
Yes, but the blue one
and the orange one

00:18:54.008 --> 00:18:55.426
aren't connected to anything.

00:18:55.509 --> 00:18:57.487
The blue one and the orange
one aren't connected to anything.

00:18:57.511 --> 00:19:00.014
Okay, blue wire goes
to the battery.

00:19:00.264 --> 00:19:02.808
Orange one goes
to the terminal strip.

00:19:03.017 --> 00:19:04.018
Blue wire to the battery,

00:19:04.268 --> 00:19:05.548
orange one
to the terminal strip.

00:19:05.645 --> 00:19:07.480
Wait, what's the terminal strip?

00:19:07.563 --> 00:19:09.732
Isn't that the shady
strip club by the airport?

00:19:09.982 --> 00:19:12.401
(Feedback whines)

00:19:12.485 --> 00:19:13.736
Damn it, she's heading over.

00:19:13.819 --> 00:19:16.280
(Radkdcrackung) Johnson?

00:19:16.739 --> 00:19:18.199
Johnson! Hophns!

00:19:19.158 --> 00:19:21.744
(Feedback whines and stops)

00:19:21.827 --> 00:19:23.037
Okay.

00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:24.330
Blue wire to the battery.

00:19:25.998 --> 00:19:27.541
Which one's the battery?

00:19:27.625 --> 00:19:29.919
You got this, Johnson.
Here goes nothing.

00:19:45.184 --> 00:19:48.020
(Heartbeat pounding)

00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:01.784
We did it!

00:20:01.867 --> 00:20:03.411
(Whoops and chuckles)

00:20:03.619 --> 00:20:04.829
Yes!

00:20:07.456 --> 00:20:09.959
Heard the Gulf war
is going well.

00:20:11.627 --> 00:20:13.379
Whoa, that was intense.

00:20:13.504 --> 00:20:14.940
Bet your ass
it was intense, Randall.

00:20:14.964 --> 00:20:16.632
(Laughs)
My life has been intense.

00:20:17.049 --> 00:20:19.343
That's why I surround myself
with people I trust.

00:20:19.427 --> 00:20:21.307
When times are tough,
you don't get rid of them.

00:20:21.470 --> 00:20:22.972
You weather out
the storm together.

00:20:23.055 --> 00:20:25.474
(Chuckles) So, is Hopkins
still in your life?

00:20:25.558 --> 00:20:27.935
Oh, yeah! Yeah, we're in
a football pool together.

00:20:28.060 --> 00:20:29.603
That's beautiful. (Laughs)

00:20:29.729 --> 00:20:30.730
So, before we go,

00:20:30.813 --> 00:20:32.893
do you have any final thoughts
about general Jackson?

00:20:32.982 --> 00:20:35.234
I know, without hesitation,
that when the chips are down,

00:20:35.317 --> 00:20:37.903
I want general Monica Jackson
by my side.

00:20:38.404 --> 00:20:41.449
She is a fighter, she's tough,
and she never gives up,

00:20:41.532 --> 00:20:43.075
and I have her back.

00:20:43.159 --> 00:20:44.160
And when we need it most,

00:20:44.243 --> 00:20:45.803
she's gonna have
america's back as well.

00:20:46.203 --> 00:20:48.330
General Jackson,
how much does it mean

00:20:48.414 --> 00:20:51.125
to hear Mr. Johnson defend you
through these tough times?

00:20:51.333 --> 00:20:53.544
It means that we have
a presidential candidate

00:20:53.627 --> 00:20:55.713
with integrity and character.

00:20:56.422 --> 00:21:00.009
And I can't think of a better
person to lead our country.

00:21:00.092 --> 00:21:01.469
And all this chatter

00:21:01.552 --> 00:21:04.722
about my college
newspaper column

00:21:05.014 --> 00:21:08.309
has really got my
comedyjuices flowing again.

00:21:09.268 --> 00:21:12.938
What? Here's my top ten
reasons why Dwayne Johnson

00:21:13.022 --> 00:21:14.106
will be a great leader.

00:21:14.190 --> 00:21:17.568
Number ten, he will
never take you for granite.

00:21:17.735 --> 00:21:20.321
Number nine, he rocks.

00:21:20.404 --> 00:21:22.448
Number eight...
How many more are there?

00:21:23.324 --> 00:21:24.366
Eight.

00:21:24.658 --> 00:21:25.701
Right.

00:21:25.785 --> 00:21:27.995
Power to the pebble.
Number seven.
