WEBVTT

00:00:07.508 --> 00:00:09.068
Casey: During the debate,
if you're thirsty,

00:00:09.092 --> 00:00:11.220
don't hesitate to stop
and take a sip of water.

00:00:11.345 --> 00:00:12.385
Hydration is not weakness.

00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:15.182
Casey, I took on a tidal wave
with my bare hands in San Andreas.

00:00:15.265 --> 00:00:16.350
I'm good around water.

00:00:16.433 --> 00:00:18.536
At some point, they will ask you
what you want your legacy to be.

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:21.522
Our polling of swing voters shows
your weakness is foreign policy,

00:00:21.688 --> 00:00:23.190
so you want your legacy to be

00:00:23.273 --> 00:00:25.001
that you were tough but fair
on the middle east.

00:00:25.025 --> 00:00:26.818
Got it, tough and fair
on the middle east.

00:00:27.778 --> 00:00:28.880
Is it cool if I refer
to my opponent

00:00:28.904 --> 00:00:30.072
as a "little candy ass"?

00:00:30.155 --> 00:00:31.758
I could say, "I'm gonna check
your little candy ass

00:00:31.782 --> 00:00:33.242
"into the smackdown hotel."

00:00:33.951 --> 00:00:34.993
I'm gonna go

00:00:35.077 --> 00:00:36.370
do something that's not...

00:00:36.995 --> 00:00:37.996
You having ideas, so...

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:39.665
But good luck. Kill it.
(Snickers)

00:00:40.832 --> 00:00:43.210
So, no, I'm not for combining

00:00:43.293 --> 00:00:45.021
the police department
and the fire department

00:00:45.045 --> 00:00:46.046
into a super unit

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:47.297
called "the fire police,"

00:00:47.506 --> 00:00:48.632
as cool as that sounds.

00:00:48.757 --> 00:00:50.133
Thank you, candidate Johnson.

00:00:50.342 --> 00:00:51.802
Let's move on
to the next question.

00:00:51.927 --> 00:00:54.263
If elected, what do you
want your legacy to be?

00:00:54.846 --> 00:00:55.847
Yes.

00:00:56.139 --> 00:00:57.140
Middle east.

00:00:57.266 --> 00:00:59.101
We'll begin with you,
senator taft.

00:00:59.184 --> 00:01:01.144
Well, as the great-great-
great grandson

00:01:01.228 --> 00:01:02.455
of president
William Howard taft,

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:04.314
I know a thing
or two about legacy.

00:01:04.648 --> 00:01:06.125
And carrying forward
that proud history,

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:08.318
I'll turn pain into strength

00:01:08.485 --> 00:01:10.445
and setbacks into victories.

00:01:10.654 --> 00:01:12.823
Meanwhile, my opponent
is a movie star

00:01:12.948 --> 00:01:15.075
who lets his stunt doubles
fight his battles for him.

00:01:15.158 --> 00:01:16.493
Okay, as a fitness advocate,

00:01:16.577 --> 00:01:17.619
let me first point out

00:01:17.703 --> 00:01:18.870
that William Howard taft

00:01:18.954 --> 00:01:20.497
was the only president

00:01:20.581 --> 00:01:22.332
to ever get stuck
in his own bathtub.

00:01:22.541 --> 00:01:24.751
I'm sorry, pics or it
didn't happen, Mr. Johnson.

00:01:24.835 --> 00:01:26.229
It's a fact.
The other fact, america,

00:01:26.253 --> 00:01:29.047
is that no one has had
to fight more than I have.

00:01:29.381 --> 00:01:31.508
I come from along line
of fighters.

00:01:32.134 --> 00:01:33.820
Let me take a quick moment
to tell you a little story

00:01:33.844 --> 00:01:34.928
about my family.

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:36.823
Adult Dwayne it
started with my grandmother,

00:01:36.847 --> 00:01:39.600
the first female wrestling
promoter in the country.

00:01:39.975 --> 00:01:42.227
No one was tougher than her.

00:01:42.311 --> 00:01:43.437
She set the tone.

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.106
Lia. Lonnie mcgill.

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:47.608
Thank you for meeting me.

00:01:48.066 --> 00:01:49.776
Bob tells me you've been
calling the office

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.279
every day since battle royale,
leaving messages.

00:01:52.362 --> 00:01:53.405
I wanna do what you do.

00:01:53.947 --> 00:01:56.950
After 40 years of slinging
insurance, I retired.

00:01:57.242 --> 00:01:58.577
And me and the missus thought,

00:01:58.702 --> 00:02:00.662
"why not finally do
something that we love?"

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:01.997
So she's growing cucumbers,

00:02:02.497 --> 00:02:05.000
and I'm trying to get into
the wrestling promotion biz.

00:02:05.125 --> 00:02:06.877
And I figured,
who better to talk to

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.087
than the queen
of Hawaiian wrestling?

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:10.631
Nice story.

00:02:11.882 --> 00:02:13.425
Here's why you're really here.

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:16.219
Lia: You heard Greg yao was
trying to steal my wrestlers.

00:02:16.303 --> 00:02:17.596
First, king Kong Bundy...

00:02:17.763 --> 00:02:19.240
Man: He signed a deal
to wrestle for yao.

00:02:19.264 --> 00:02:20.265
Lia: Then junkyard dog.

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:21.850
He upgraded me to the radisson.

00:02:21.933 --> 00:02:23.161
Lia: He even tried
to take rocky.

00:02:23.185 --> 00:02:25.145
It says "number 1,"
'cause that's what you'll be

00:02:25.437 --> 00:02:26.730
when you sign with me.

00:02:27.189 --> 00:02:30.108
And you say, "hey, I wanna
get in on that too."

00:02:30.525 --> 00:02:32.527
I'm sorry? You see me as weak.

00:02:33.195 --> 00:02:34.863
"What's grandma gonna do?

00:02:35.113 --> 00:02:36.573
"Hit me with her purse?"

00:02:36.823 --> 00:02:38.103
That's what you say to yourself.

00:02:38.367 --> 00:02:39.636
I... that doesn't sound like me.

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.244
You know how a queen
keeps her throne?

00:02:42.412 --> 00:02:44.164
By ruling with an iron fist.

00:02:47.542 --> 00:02:49.461
(Upbeat music playing)

00:03:01.515 --> 00:03:03.308
(Sighs) Excuse me.

00:03:17.155 --> 00:03:19.533
She's a bad mama jama

00:03:20.617 --> 00:03:22.428
adult Dwayne now, obviously,
my grandmother was not afraid

00:03:22.452 --> 00:03:23.829
to get her hands dirty.

00:03:24.955 --> 00:03:26.123
Neither was I.

00:03:26.665 --> 00:03:27.833
(Upbeat music playing)

00:03:30.293 --> 00:03:31.294
Young Dwayne: Damn.

00:03:31.712 --> 00:03:32.838
I need that.

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:38.385
I need a boogie board.

00:03:41.471 --> 00:03:43.640
Adult Dwayne: But sometimes
she would go too far,

00:03:43.724 --> 00:03:44.725
and she knew it.

00:03:44.891 --> 00:03:46.351
Today, my mom left you mangoes.

00:03:47.561 --> 00:03:49.681
Look, she pre-sliced some
of them the way you like it.

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:51.189
Why does she keep leaving fruit?

00:03:51.732 --> 00:03:52.875
Why doesn't she just talk to me?

00:03:52.899 --> 00:03:53.900
She's ashamed.

00:03:53.984 --> 00:03:55.420
She uses big fruit
to intimidate people,

00:03:55.444 --> 00:03:57.279
and small fruit
to apologize to people.

00:03:57.362 --> 00:03:58.780
She lets the fruit
do the talking.

00:03:59.072 --> 00:04:00.949
I can't believe
she thought I would stab her

00:04:01.032 --> 00:04:03.072
in the back and sign an
exclusive contract with yao.

00:04:03.618 --> 00:04:05.829
I mean, if anything,
I'm the one that should be mad

00:04:05.912 --> 00:04:08.457
about that screwjob she pulled
on me at the battle royale.

00:04:08.665 --> 00:04:09.791
What the hell are you doing?

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.626
Lia changed finish last minute.

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:12.836
I saw you with yao.

00:04:12.961 --> 00:04:15.589
I double-cross you before you
could double-cross me!

00:04:15.672 --> 00:04:17.007
I did meet with yao.

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:19.968
You are a degenerate
scumbag loser

00:04:20.051 --> 00:04:22.471
with bad hair
and a cocaine problem.

00:04:23.638 --> 00:04:24.681
Rocky...

00:04:25.182 --> 00:04:27.476
Honey, yeah, I think
she does think you're mad.

00:04:27.559 --> 00:04:28.685
That's why she feels so bad.

00:04:28.852 --> 00:04:30.604
Oh. Good.

00:04:30.854 --> 00:04:32.481
Ugh, that red light is back.

00:04:32.898 --> 00:04:34.125
It's been blinking
since yesterday.

00:04:34.149 --> 00:04:35.400
It's driving me crazy!

00:04:35.484 --> 00:04:37.084
Just call the front desk.
They'll fix it.

00:04:38.695 --> 00:04:40.113
Or throw a towel over it.

00:04:40.697 --> 00:04:41.948
Oh, hey, I spoke with Vince

00:04:42.032 --> 00:04:43.867
about my run
in the New York territory.

00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:45.702
He wants to pair me up
with Tony atlas,

00:04:46.036 --> 00:04:47.245
and if things go well,

00:04:47.579 --> 00:04:50.624
set us up to be future
tag team champs. (Chuckles)

00:04:50.791 --> 00:04:52.542
Oh, remind me to call Tony,

00:04:52.626 --> 00:04:54.395
and tell him to stop talking
about women's feet in public.

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:55.420
"Rocky Johnson,

00:04:55.712 --> 00:04:58.423
"wwf tag team champion"
sounds pretty good.

00:04:58.632 --> 00:05:01.051
So does "ata Johnson,
star search champion."

00:05:01.551 --> 00:05:03.154
It's been a couple weeks.
When are you gonna hear back

00:05:03.178 --> 00:05:04.322
from that audition tape
you sent in?

00:05:04.346 --> 00:05:05.388
I'm not holding my breath.

00:05:05.472 --> 00:05:06.908
I'm sure they just
threw it in the trash.

00:05:06.932 --> 00:05:08.350
Hey, now you can't
think that way.

00:05:08.433 --> 00:05:10.060
(Crumpung) Oh.

00:05:11.353 --> 00:05:13.480
Dewey, did you put this
under my pillow?

00:05:13.563 --> 00:05:15.315
That's where that is.

00:05:15.607 --> 00:05:16.942
I was looking for it.

00:05:17.067 --> 00:05:18.707
We've been through this.
You're too young.

00:05:18.777 --> 00:05:21.238
Ugh, not the age thing again.

00:05:21.822 --> 00:05:22.823
Hey, careful!

00:05:22.906 --> 00:05:24.199
That towel is there
for a reason.

00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:26.618
I've seen kids half my age
riding these.

00:05:26.743 --> 00:05:29.138
You've seen a five year old on
the open ocean boogie boarding?

00:05:29.162 --> 00:05:31.623
Hey, remember when
Dewey was five,

00:05:31.873 --> 00:05:33.226
and I used to let him sit
on my lap

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:35.377
and "drive" the car? (Chuckles)

00:05:35.877 --> 00:05:36.957
What are you talking about?

00:05:37.337 --> 00:05:38.630
I don't know.

00:05:38.713 --> 00:05:39.857
I just walked in
mid-conversation

00:05:39.881 --> 00:05:41.001
and wanted to be in the mix.

00:05:42.968 --> 00:05:44.302
It started blinking a day ago.

00:05:44.386 --> 00:05:45.655
I think you need
to replace the phone.

00:05:45.679 --> 00:05:46.847
Your phone's not broken.

00:05:47.013 --> 00:05:48.533
The red light means
you have a message.

00:05:48.557 --> 00:05:49.742
A message? But I
pressed the red light.

00:05:49.766 --> 00:05:51.268
Nothing happened. No, no.

00:05:51.351 --> 00:05:52.912
You have to press the button
with the envelope.

00:05:52.936 --> 00:05:53.996
The envelope? I thought that was

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:55.300
to summon the mailman?
It's fine.

00:05:55.355 --> 00:05:56.955
I'm listening to your
message, right now.

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:58.817
It's some lady named...

00:05:59.234 --> 00:06:00.318
Star search?

00:06:00.443 --> 00:06:01.444
(Gasps)

00:06:01.528 --> 00:06:03.029
She loved your tape. (Gasps)

00:06:03.196 --> 00:06:05.031
She's inviting you
to come to Los Angeles

00:06:05.115 --> 00:06:07.242
for an in-person audition.
Oh, my god!

00:06:07.534 --> 00:06:08.660
What is it? A spider?

00:06:08.743 --> 00:06:09.804
Star search loved my audition!

00:06:09.828 --> 00:06:10.829
Yes!

00:06:10.912 --> 00:06:12.163
And the phone's not broken!

00:06:12.247 --> 00:06:13.248
Yes!

00:06:13.331 --> 00:06:14.374
(Bothlaugh)

00:06:14.749 --> 00:06:16.549
And your dry cleaning's
ready to be picked up.

00:06:19.963 --> 00:06:21.756
Uh-huh. Okay, thank you.

00:06:23.425 --> 00:06:24.652
They're flying me to la tomorrow

00:06:24.676 --> 00:06:25.996
for the second round
of auditions.

00:06:26.595 --> 00:06:28.035
They want me to sing
my original song

00:06:28.096 --> 00:06:30.098
I auditioned with,
and prepare a second song,

00:06:30.181 --> 00:06:31.308
a cover. My sharona.

00:06:31.391 --> 00:06:32.451
Don't go breaking my heart.

00:06:32.475 --> 00:06:34.036
I need to make a list
of emergency contacts.

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:35.413
I need to write out
Dewey's allergies.

00:06:35.437 --> 00:06:36.664
Oh, you need to forgive my mom.

00:06:36.688 --> 00:06:38.440
Oh, uh, why is that a thing?

00:06:38.523 --> 00:06:39.691
Because it's time,

00:06:39.816 --> 00:06:41.294
and we need her to watch
Dewey while I'm gone.

00:06:41.318 --> 00:06:42.420
I'll get her to go to the beach,

00:06:42.444 --> 00:06:43.754
find you a beautiful
apology seashell,

00:06:43.778 --> 00:06:45.030
she can rinse it and wrap it...

00:06:45.196 --> 00:06:46.865
Babe, babe, babe, babe, babe?

00:06:47.032 --> 00:06:49.117
I got time before Vince
needs me in New York.

00:06:49.242 --> 00:06:50.243
I can watch Dewey.

00:06:50.785 --> 00:06:52.329
You've never watched me before.

00:06:52.412 --> 00:06:53.413
Boy, yes I have.

00:06:53.496 --> 00:06:54.623
No, youhavent haventl?

00:06:54.706 --> 00:06:55.808
Definitely not. You haven't.

00:06:55.832 --> 00:06:57.459
Oh. Huh.

00:06:57.626 --> 00:06:59.002
Okay, well,
we'll start right now.

00:06:59.169 --> 00:07:00.587
It'll be easy. The boy's 10,

00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:01.838
he's practically grown.

00:07:01.922 --> 00:07:03.298
He's still a little boy.

00:07:03.757 --> 00:07:05.026
Who are you calling
a little boy?

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:06.551
I can pick you up. (Scoffs)

00:07:07.218 --> 00:07:08.553
Oh, hey, no, no, no, no, no!

00:07:08.637 --> 00:07:09.763
(G roans) Stop.

00:07:09.888 --> 00:07:12.140
Look, I was 13 when I
went out on my own.

00:07:12.223 --> 00:07:14.184
Now, I'm sure Dewey
can handle being watched

00:07:14.267 --> 00:07:16.728
by his own father
for a few days.

00:07:18.229 --> 00:07:19.230
Okay.

00:07:19.981 --> 00:07:21.107
Okay, yeah.

00:07:21.274 --> 00:07:22.793
You can have some
father-son bonding time.

00:07:22.817 --> 00:07:23.860
That's right, ah!

00:07:23.944 --> 00:07:26.196
The Johnson boys
are gonna hit the town!

00:07:26.279 --> 00:07:27.280
(Chuckles)

00:07:28.114 --> 00:07:29.950
I'm only talking spaghetti
and go-carts, baby.

00:07:30.325 --> 00:07:32.160
Okay, so, I'd like
to bring us back

00:07:32.327 --> 00:07:34.079
to the boogie board idea.

00:07:34.454 --> 00:07:36.164
If dad left home at 13,

00:07:36.247 --> 00:07:38.333
feels like I can lie down
on a piece of foam

00:07:38.416 --> 00:07:39.876
shaped like a pac-man ghost

00:07:40.168 --> 00:07:42.379
and feel the joy
of being pushed by a wave.

00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:48.176
Okay. You can get
the boogie board.

00:07:48.259 --> 00:07:49.260
Yes!

00:07:49.344 --> 00:07:50.720
And to celebrate my good news,

00:07:51.012 --> 00:07:53.056
I'm taking the family
to Lorenzo's tonight

00:07:53.223 --> 00:07:54.557
for a nice dinner.

00:07:54.641 --> 00:07:56.059
Great idea, baby!

00:07:56.142 --> 00:07:57.602
Ha, I love it.

00:07:57.936 --> 00:07:59.646
Ooh! (Chuckles)

00:07:59.938 --> 00:08:00.978
That's how you do it, son.

00:08:01.022 --> 00:08:02.482
And I'm inviting my mother.

00:08:03.274 --> 00:08:04.275
Mmm-hmm.

00:08:04.609 --> 00:08:06.170
Adult Dwayne: Even though
it wasn't my mom's fight,

00:08:06.194 --> 00:08:09.072
she was the best at bringing
our family back together.

00:08:09.155 --> 00:08:10.615
I gotta say, Lia,

00:08:10.991 --> 00:08:13.702
this is one beautiful
apology shell. Thank you.

00:08:13.785 --> 00:08:14.786
Peter gave it to me

00:08:14.869 --> 00:08:16.913
when I caught him watching
women's volleyball.

00:08:17.789 --> 00:08:19.833
I'm so happy we squashed this.

00:08:20.166 --> 00:08:22.043
Hlneverdoubt your loyalty again.

00:08:22.127 --> 00:08:24.087
Ah, water under the bridge.
That's right.

00:08:24.337 --> 00:08:25.922
We are family. Family.

00:08:26.006 --> 00:08:27.132
Always got your back.

00:08:27.215 --> 00:08:28.359
Your back will always be had.

00:08:28.383 --> 00:08:29.527
Young Dwayne: Are you guys done?

00:08:29.551 --> 00:08:31.928
Can I please have some
of grandma's attention now?

00:08:32.012 --> 00:08:33.513
Sorry. Mmm, go ahead.

00:08:33.596 --> 00:08:35.056
Look at my new
boogie board, grandma!

00:08:35.306 --> 00:08:37.100
My goodness, sweetheart.
I love it!

00:08:37.183 --> 00:08:38.184
Her name's Tanya.

00:08:38.268 --> 00:08:39.269
So wonderful.

00:08:39.477 --> 00:08:41.730
I had something very similar
when I was a kid,

00:08:41.813 --> 00:08:43.523
but it was a piece of driftwood.

00:08:43.857 --> 00:08:45.066
(Laughs)

00:08:45.567 --> 00:08:46.711
I can't believe
this is happening.

00:08:46.735 --> 00:08:48.111
I can't believe I'm going to la

00:08:48.194 --> 00:08:49.320
to try out for star search.

00:08:49.571 --> 00:08:51.406
That's wonderful, ia'u pepe.

00:08:51.656 --> 00:08:54.159
Your father used to say
your voice was so special.

00:08:54.284 --> 00:08:55.285
Thank you, mom.

00:08:56.161 --> 00:08:57.328
You'd be so proud, Peter.

00:08:57.579 --> 00:08:58.747
This is all for you.

00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:00.540
And while you're gone,

00:09:00.623 --> 00:09:01.875
rocky and I are going to plot

00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:03.168
a revenge against yao.

00:09:03.334 --> 00:09:04.854
Rocky: I already took
his cowboy boots.

00:09:05.128 --> 00:09:06.463
He'll be feeling that
for a while.

00:09:06.546 --> 00:09:07.589
That's only the beginning.

00:09:07.964 --> 00:09:09.799
Next, we're gonna
crush his spirit.

00:09:09.883 --> 00:09:11.217
Mom, you can't do that.

00:09:11.301 --> 00:09:12.677
Yao is after our business.

00:09:12.886 --> 00:09:15.263
Your father's business
and our family legacy.

00:09:15.722 --> 00:09:18.433
In this family,
we stand up for ourselves.

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:19.601
Isn't that right?

00:09:19.684 --> 00:09:20.727
That's right. Definitely.

00:09:20.810 --> 00:09:21.936
He must pay.

00:09:22.270 --> 00:09:23.438
"He must pay"?

00:09:23.521 --> 00:09:25.356
What are you planning to do?
Nothing.

00:09:25.648 --> 00:09:26.876
Then why are you
smiling like that?

00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:27.984
No reason.

00:09:34.199 --> 00:09:35.408
Yao: No!

00:09:37.077 --> 00:09:38.119
What?

00:09:39.412 --> 00:09:40.663
Oh, my god.

00:09:40.997 --> 00:09:42.499
My bird of fire!

00:09:42.749 --> 00:09:44.459
My Greek gods and goddesses!

00:09:44.667 --> 00:09:47.337
Sugar's corrosive
on a clear coat!

00:09:47.962 --> 00:09:49.798
Justdechnedtheinsurance onthese.

00:09:51.674 --> 00:09:52.926
(Waves rumbling)

00:09:53.343 --> 00:09:55.063
Adult Dwayne: Now,
some fights you choose...

00:09:56.387 --> 00:09:58.598
And some fights,
they choose you.

00:10:01.851 --> 00:10:04.270
Hey. I'm sebi.

00:10:04.646 --> 00:10:06.231
Hi, sebi. I'm Dewey,

00:10:06.314 --> 00:10:07.941
and this is my boogie board...

00:10:08.024 --> 00:10:09.734
Kenny wants to fight you.

00:10:10.401 --> 00:10:11.712
Adult Dwayne: I
didn't know who Kenny was

00:10:11.736 --> 00:10:13.154
or even why he wanted
to fight me,

00:10:13.238 --> 00:10:14.531
but, like my grandmother said,

00:10:14.614 --> 00:10:16.658
in our family, we always
stand up for ourselves.

00:10:17.033 --> 00:10:18.660
Hell yeah, I'll fight him.

00:10:19.410 --> 00:10:21.162
Who's Kenny? That's Kenny.

00:10:24.749 --> 00:10:27.168
By the way, I'm not
affiliated with him.

00:10:27.377 --> 00:10:29.129
He stole my shaved ice and said

00:10:29.629 --> 00:10:30.898
he wouldn't give it
back until I...

00:10:30.922 --> 00:10:33.174
Can't talk. My ride's here.

00:10:37.846 --> 00:10:39.222
Sebi: You missed that one!

00:10:39.472 --> 00:10:40.682
I know, sebi!

00:10:42.267 --> 00:10:45.436
(Singing)
I know it's not your way

00:10:45.937 --> 00:10:47.522
hey, sorry to interrupt.

00:10:47.856 --> 00:10:49.792
I know you said this is the
perfect acoustic chamber

00:10:49.816 --> 00:10:51.234
for you to practice yoursong,

00:10:51.776 --> 00:10:53.671
but it's also the perfect
chamber for something else,

00:10:53.695 --> 00:10:54.696
if you know what I mean.

00:10:54.779 --> 00:10:55.979
I just need five more minutes.

00:10:56.656 --> 00:10:58.408
You know what?
I love you so much,

00:10:58.491 --> 00:10:59.868
I'll give you six.

00:11:00.743 --> 00:11:02.620
Ata: (Continues singing)
Not your way

00:11:03.037 --> 00:11:04.581
they took Tanya!

00:11:04.873 --> 00:11:06.374
Who's Tanya? My boogie board.

00:11:06.583 --> 00:11:07.584
Who did?

00:11:09.210 --> 00:11:11.462
Kenny, heard you wanted
to fight.

00:11:11.629 --> 00:11:12.881
You're in my surf spot.

00:11:13.006 --> 00:11:14.525
If you don't want
to get your ass kicked,

00:11:14.549 --> 00:11:15.550
you gotta pay the price.

00:11:15.633 --> 00:11:17.343
Pay the price? What price?

00:11:17.468 --> 00:11:18.553
Fifty bucks.

00:11:18.803 --> 00:11:19.971
And your boogie board.

00:11:20.138 --> 00:11:21.723
Well, I don't have any money,

00:11:22.307 --> 00:11:24.142
so, you sure as hell
ain't getting that.

00:11:25.685 --> 00:11:27.896
Looks like we're gonna
have to settle this another way.

00:11:28.062 --> 00:11:29.662
Adult Dwayne:
I was ready to fight Kenny.

00:11:29.814 --> 00:11:31.316
Hey, yo. Check this kid out.

00:11:32.650 --> 00:11:34.110
Adult Dwayne:
But Kenny rolls deep.

00:11:34.736 --> 00:11:37.030
Thinks he can take on
thelocalboys.

00:11:37.113 --> 00:11:38.198
Ad u it dwayn e: Uh-oh.

00:11:38.281 --> 00:11:39.282
Your board...

00:11:41.701 --> 00:11:43.745
Is gonna make a great present
for my mistress.

00:11:44.787 --> 00:11:46.956
They cut my leash, took
my board, and beat my ass.

00:11:47.582 --> 00:11:49.626
They were gonna Bury me
up to my neck in the sand,

00:11:49.834 --> 00:11:51.002
but I ran away.

00:11:51.794 --> 00:11:53.296
I'm sorry, dad. Hey.

00:11:53.504 --> 00:11:55.465
Never apologize for
standing up for yourself.

00:11:55.590 --> 00:11:57.800
Oh, no, iwasn't
apologizing about that.

00:11:58.009 --> 00:11:59.510
I was saying sorry becausellost

00:11:59.636 --> 00:12:01.429
oh, okay, good.
Yeah, I'm glad I fought.

00:12:01.512 --> 00:12:04.432
Good, good. Um, listen, Dewey.

00:12:05.016 --> 00:12:07.227
Let's not tell your mom
about this.

00:12:07.810 --> 00:12:09.479
She's got a lot
going on right now,

00:12:09.562 --> 00:12:11.105
and we don't want her to worry.

00:12:11.272 --> 00:12:13.358
But as soon as she leaves
for the airport,

00:12:13.608 --> 00:12:15.360
you and I will deal
with those kids.

00:12:17.946 --> 00:12:19.781
Lia? Yao called.

00:12:20.114 --> 00:12:21.759
He says he wants to have
a sit-down with you.

00:12:21.783 --> 00:12:23.326
I think our threats worked.

00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:25.370
He says he wants
to end this beef.

00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:28.164
I already know
what I'm gonna wear.

00:12:29.207 --> 00:12:31.251
(Western music playing)

00:12:37.090 --> 00:12:38.925
Lia. Bob.

00:12:39.676 --> 00:12:41.427
Greg. Drab boots.

00:12:41.761 --> 00:12:43.263
They're temporary. Okay?

00:12:43.346 --> 00:12:44.931
I'm having new ones custom-made.

00:12:45.014 --> 00:12:46.951
I'm just waiting for this
special African yellow dye...

00:12:46.975 --> 00:12:49.018
We're indoors,
take your hat off.

00:12:49.227 --> 00:12:50.353
And show some respect.

00:12:51.562 --> 00:12:53.374
I know you're the one
who's been threatening me

00:12:53.398 --> 00:12:54.482
and damaging my property.

00:12:54.691 --> 00:12:56.609
Then you stay away
from my wrestlers.

00:12:57.110 --> 00:12:59.028
I run the Hawaii territory,

00:12:59.112 --> 00:13:01.364
and if you want to put on
a match, you go through me.

00:13:01.489 --> 00:13:02.969
(Scoffs) I don't
work for you anymore.

00:13:03.074 --> 00:13:04.701
You think because
you take my wrestlers

00:13:04.784 --> 00:13:05.785
that we are equals?

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:08.371
I am a shark, and you are...

00:13:08.913 --> 00:13:11.082
Bob, what's the name
of those small fish?

00:13:11.374 --> 00:13:12.709
Guppy no, no, no.

00:13:12.834 --> 00:13:14.669
The ones that attach
themselves to the sharks

00:13:14.752 --> 00:13:16.129
and eat their leftovers.

00:13:16.296 --> 00:13:18.214
Oh, remora? Yes.

00:13:18.298 --> 00:13:19.716
You are remora.

00:13:20.008 --> 00:13:21.968
And you eat what I let you eat.

00:13:22.343 --> 00:13:23.623
You know,
this business is tough.

00:13:23.803 --> 00:13:25.263
People die in this business.

00:13:25.471 --> 00:13:28.099
My husband, he died
because of this business.

00:13:28.474 --> 00:13:30.143
Didn't Peter die of cancer?

00:13:30.268 --> 00:13:31.769
He died how I say he died!

00:13:32.353 --> 00:13:33.980
Okay. Fine.

00:13:34.063 --> 00:13:35.565
Just tell me
what you want me to do.

00:13:35.773 --> 00:13:36.774
Pay.

00:13:36.858 --> 00:13:39.193
You rent the rings
and the venues through me.

00:13:39.402 --> 00:13:40.611
You book my wrestlers,

00:13:40.862 --> 00:13:43.031
and you pay my tribute fee
of $5,000.

00:13:43.156 --> 00:13:44.758
I don't have that kind
of money lying around.

00:13:44.782 --> 00:13:45.783
Then get it!

00:13:45.867 --> 00:13:47.869
Hi, Lia. What are
you having today?

00:13:47.994 --> 00:13:48.995
Oh, good morning, Marisa.

00:13:49.078 --> 00:13:51.706
I'll have silver dollar
pancakes short stack

00:13:51.789 --> 00:13:53.207
with a side of sausage.

00:13:53.333 --> 00:13:54.500
Home fries with gravy.

00:13:54.667 --> 00:13:55.710
I'll have a Cobb salad...

00:13:55.877 --> 00:13:57.357
No, no, nothing for him.
He's leaving.

00:13:58.921 --> 00:14:00.965
Hey, you tell Bob
when you have it.

00:14:02.216 --> 00:14:04.344
(Upbeat music playing)

00:14:12.518 --> 00:14:13.519
(Tires screeching)

00:14:25.156 --> 00:14:26.157
(Knocks)

00:14:30.578 --> 00:14:32.663
And I keep some extra
money in a coffee can

00:14:32.747 --> 00:14:33.915
in the closet, just in case.

00:14:33.998 --> 00:14:35.517
Oh, don't let Dewey
eat too many mangoes.

00:14:35.541 --> 00:14:37.377
He's mildly allergic.
He gets puffy lips.

00:14:37.460 --> 00:14:39.837
Please check in on my mom.
She's under so much pressure.

00:14:39.921 --> 00:14:41.631
I will. I'm really
worried abouther

00:14:41.714 --> 00:14:43.508
you just concentrate
on this audition.

00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:45.885
(Sighs) I'm gonna blow
the doors off star search.

00:14:45.968 --> 00:14:47.095
Oh, I know that's right.

00:14:47.178 --> 00:14:48.179
I'm so proud of you!

00:14:50.056 --> 00:14:52.016
Good luck, mom. Oh.

00:14:52.183 --> 00:14:54.310
Oh, I'm gonna miss
you so much. Hmm.

00:14:54.644 --> 00:14:55.924
I'll see you
in a few days, okay?

00:14:56.020 --> 00:14:57.700
See you in a few days.
Well, hopefully not.

00:14:58.481 --> 00:15:00.066
What do you mean? I mean,

00:15:00.233 --> 00:15:01.673
hopefully this is just
the beginning.

00:15:02.443 --> 00:15:04.695
You kill the audition,
they put you on the show,

00:15:04.779 --> 00:15:07.240
a label signs you,
you go on tour!

00:15:07.490 --> 00:15:08.825
I mean, how cool would that be?

00:15:09.033 --> 00:15:10.593
Both of us on tour,
you with your music,

00:15:11.077 --> 00:15:12.245
me with the wwf?

00:15:12.370 --> 00:15:13.889
Okay, let's not get
ahead of ourselves.

00:15:13.913 --> 00:15:15.289
But that's the dream, right?

00:15:15.832 --> 00:15:17.834
Right. I... I...

00:15:18.918 --> 00:15:21.504
So, ifwe're on tour,
what about Dewey?

00:15:22.046 --> 00:15:23.840
Uh, he'll split time
between me and you.

00:15:23.965 --> 00:15:25.150
Sometimes he'll stay
with your mom.

00:15:25.174 --> 00:15:26.259
We'll figure it out.

00:15:26.342 --> 00:15:28.511
So, I just wouldn't
see him half the time?

00:15:29.554 --> 00:15:30.930
No, no, not half. (Chuckles)

00:15:31.013 --> 00:15:32.733
You wouldn't see him, like,
40% of the time.

00:15:33.182 --> 00:15:34.660
But... but don't worry about
that right now.

00:15:34.684 --> 00:15:36.686
That's in the future.
This is just the beginning.

00:15:36.769 --> 00:15:38.771
Mmm-hmm. Yeah.
It's just the beginning.

00:15:39.939 --> 00:15:41.190
Okay. All right, bye, baby.

00:15:41.274 --> 00:15:42.608
I love you both so much.
Bye, mom.

00:15:42.692 --> 00:15:44.444
Now, you drive safe.
You got precious cargo.

00:15:44.527 --> 00:15:45.820
Bye, babe. There she goes. Bye.

00:15:47.989 --> 00:15:49.240
(Sighs)

00:15:51.742 --> 00:15:53.661
All right. Show me those
punks whojumped you.

00:15:56.706 --> 00:15:59.876
Adult Dwayne: Let me tell you, if
you were ever jumped by a gang of bullies

00:15:59.959 --> 00:16:02.170
you wanted rocky Johnson
in your corner.

00:16:02.336 --> 00:16:03.504
There they are. Hey!

00:16:04.547 --> 00:16:06.048
Heard y'all jumped my boy.

00:16:06.299 --> 00:16:08.009
That's a bitch-ass move.

00:16:08.134 --> 00:16:09.177
Eight against one.

00:16:09.635 --> 00:16:10.845
Now, listen up. My son

00:16:10.928 --> 00:16:13.014
would kick the crap
out of any one of you

00:16:13.097 --> 00:16:15.266
one-on-one, and
he'll do it right now.

00:16:16.434 --> 00:16:17.911
And I heard one of
y'all pulled a knife!

00:16:17.935 --> 00:16:19.079
No one pulled a knife on your...

00:16:19.103 --> 00:16:20.104
You shut the hell up!

00:16:20.938 --> 00:16:22.315
Y'all like knives, huh?

00:16:23.149 --> 00:16:24.317
(Chuckles) Well...

00:16:25.067 --> 00:16:26.694
I got the knife now.

00:16:28.905 --> 00:16:29.906
That's what I thought.

00:16:30.281 --> 00:16:32.074
Dewey! Get your board.

00:16:36.162 --> 00:16:38.831
All right!
Dewey and Dewey's dad!

00:16:39.081 --> 00:16:40.625
Sebi, are you okay?

00:16:40.875 --> 00:16:42.960
I'm buried straight down,
but I'm fine.

00:16:43.211 --> 00:16:44.337
I'm clapping right now.

00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:46.088
You can't see, but I am.

00:16:47.173 --> 00:16:48.799
Anytime, one-on-one.

00:16:49.050 --> 00:16:50.051
Anytime.

00:16:53.179 --> 00:16:54.639
Dad, that was amazing.

00:16:54.722 --> 00:16:56.265
Sebi: Bye, Dewey!
Thank you, dew.

00:16:56.891 --> 00:16:59.268
We believe in standing up
for ourselves in this family.

00:16:59.852 --> 00:17:01.896
But sometimes, the fight
isn't always fair.

00:17:02.063 --> 00:17:04.524
When that happens, know
I always got your back.

00:17:05.566 --> 00:17:07.652
Dad, do you wanna
go boogie boarding with me?

00:17:07.777 --> 00:17:10.154
No, son. You know I
don't like to get my hair wet.

00:17:10.488 --> 00:17:12.073
(Waves crashing)

00:17:13.824 --> 00:17:17.703
Announcer: Aloha. Flight
24 will be boarding shortly.

00:17:19.455 --> 00:17:22.041
(Announcer continues
talking indistinctly)

00:17:23.543 --> 00:17:24.544
You into surfing?

00:17:24.752 --> 00:17:25.795
Oh. (Chuckles)

00:17:25.878 --> 00:17:28.839
No, I just got my son one
of those, uh, boogie boards.

00:17:29.090 --> 00:17:30.299
Uh, that'll be $6.50.

00:17:30.466 --> 00:17:32.260
He's not here with me. My son.

00:17:32.510 --> 00:17:34.971
But I thought he'd like
the magazine when I get back.

00:17:35.304 --> 00:17:36.514
I'm only gone a few days.

00:17:36.597 --> 00:17:38.637
And, you know, if! Have
to be gone longer next time,

00:17:38.683 --> 00:17:39.976
we'll figure it out. (Chuckles)

00:17:40.059 --> 00:17:42.162
I mean, when I was growing up,
we traveled all the time.

00:17:42.186 --> 00:17:44.438
My dad was a wrestler and
my mom and I were on the road

00:17:44.522 --> 00:17:46.315
constantly with him,
and it was fine.

00:17:46.983 --> 00:17:49.777
Of course, my mom
was always with me.

00:17:50.611 --> 00:17:52.738
She was that steady presence.

00:17:54.365 --> 00:17:56.492
I remember
that made me feel like

00:17:56.784 --> 00:17:58.286
no matter where we were,

00:17:58.411 --> 00:17:59.620
that was home.

00:18:00.913 --> 00:18:02.206
That's sweet.

00:18:03.583 --> 00:18:05.126
Please take the change
from my hand.

00:18:06.877 --> 00:18:07.878
(Chuckles)

00:18:07.962 --> 00:18:08.963
(Coins clinking)

00:18:10.590 --> 00:18:11.882
(Knocking at door)

00:18:14.802 --> 00:18:16.762
Mom? What are you doing here?

00:18:16.929 --> 00:18:18.139
I have bad news.

00:18:18.514 --> 00:18:20.154
Star search called
and changed their mind.

00:18:20.182 --> 00:18:21.392
Really?

00:18:21.601 --> 00:18:23.728
Wait, they called you
at the airport?

00:18:23.978 --> 00:18:26.314
Yep. Announced it
over the loudspeaker.

00:18:27.523 --> 00:18:29.233
Said they made a mistake
and accepted

00:18:29.317 --> 00:18:30.443
too many talented people,

00:18:30.526 --> 00:18:33.154
but they're gonna keep me
in mind for the future.

00:18:33.487 --> 00:18:34.739
I'm sorry, mom.

00:18:35.114 --> 00:18:36.657
Are you sad? No.

00:18:37.283 --> 00:18:38.826
Because now I get
to be here with you.

00:18:39.285 --> 00:18:40.286
Mmm.

00:18:40.661 --> 00:18:42.621
Did you have some good
bonding time with your dad?

00:18:42.705 --> 00:18:44.665
Yeah. We had fun at the beach.

00:18:46.167 --> 00:18:47.960
Is that a knife?
Let's sing a song together.

00:18:49.045 --> 00:18:50.087
Sure.

00:18:50.838 --> 00:18:52.548
Yourfavorhe? (Chuckles) Yeah.

00:18:53.758 --> 00:18:57.386
(Singing) Don't go
breaking my heart

00:18:57.470 --> 00:18:59.972
I couldn't if I tried

00:19:01.849 --> 00:19:05.019
oh, honey, if I get restless...

00:19:05.645 --> 00:19:08.105
Baby, you're not that kind

00:19:08.522 --> 00:19:09.523
(laughs)

00:19:11.484 --> 00:19:13.653
Both: Don't go breaking my heart

00:19:13.778 --> 00:19:15.672
adu it dwayn e: Ultimately,
my mom decided the fight

00:19:15.696 --> 00:19:17.615
to become a star could wait.

00:19:17.907 --> 00:19:20.534
It wasn't worth losing
these moments with her family.

00:19:20.785 --> 00:19:23.954
(Both continue
singing and laughing)

00:19:24.872 --> 00:19:26.791
Lia: Francine, go pee-pee
for mama.

00:19:26.874 --> 00:19:28.626
No, don't lick my shoes.

00:19:28.793 --> 00:19:30.086
Go pee-pee.

00:19:30.169 --> 00:19:31.253
Hey, Lia.

00:19:31.962 --> 00:19:33.589
Hey. Where's Dewey?

00:19:33.756 --> 00:19:35.132
He's relaxing at the hotel.

00:19:35.549 --> 00:19:38.302
But I got these for you.

00:19:38.427 --> 00:19:40.846
Ooh. Yao's boots.

00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:42.765
Look how they glow
in the moonlight.

00:19:42.848 --> 00:19:45.935
Ooh, look how the pores in
the leather accept the dye.

00:19:46.185 --> 00:19:47.436
(Chuckles)

00:19:47.603 --> 00:19:50.231
Anyway, how is everything?
You okay?

00:19:50.648 --> 00:19:53.317
I think I finally got
everything under control.

00:19:53.526 --> 00:19:54.527
Good.

00:19:54.902 --> 00:19:56.630
'Cause ata was worried
about some of the stuff

00:19:56.654 --> 00:19:57.974
you were saying
at the restaurant.

00:19:58.072 --> 00:20:00.072
I shouldn't have said
those things in front of her.

00:20:00.533 --> 00:20:04.161
But, you know, Peter built
polynesian pacific pro wrestling.

00:20:05.496 --> 00:20:07.540
And I won't let it be torn down.

00:20:07.832 --> 00:20:10.960
No one can question, you
are one badass woman, Lia.

00:20:11.377 --> 00:20:12.920
Respected, feared,

00:20:13.003 --> 00:20:14.797
loathed, andloved.

00:20:15.673 --> 00:20:16.799
I like that.

00:20:16.966 --> 00:20:18.676
Put it on a t-shirt. (Chuckles)

00:20:18.801 --> 00:20:21.303
Come on. Help me
put on my new boots.

00:20:23.514 --> 00:20:25.599
(Camera shutter clicking)

00:20:28.602 --> 00:20:31.202
Adult Dwayne: Sometimes, when
you think a fight has just been won,

00:20:32.106 --> 00:20:33.983
you find out it's only
just beginning.

00:20:34.066 --> 00:20:35.192
(Knocking)

00:20:38.863 --> 00:20:41.031
Did you hear, FBI?
Did you get it?

00:20:41.115 --> 00:20:42.950
We got her asking you
for a tribute fee,

00:20:43.033 --> 00:20:44.535
which sounds to me
like extortion.

00:20:44.744 --> 00:20:46.120
Yes, good!

00:20:46.704 --> 00:20:48.080
So you can arrest her? Yeah.

00:20:48.164 --> 00:20:49.808
If we can get more,
we have a better chance

00:20:49.832 --> 00:20:51.333
of making sure
the charges stick.

00:20:52.793 --> 00:20:54.104
Adult Dwayne: My
grandmother didn't know it,

00:20:54.128 --> 00:20:56.422
but her biggest fight
was yet to come.

00:20:56.505 --> 00:20:57.506
(Camera shutter clicks)

00:20:58.132 --> 00:21:00.092
My whole life,
I've watched my family

00:21:00.176 --> 00:21:01.761
fight to keep what's theirs,

00:21:01.844 --> 00:21:03.345
fight to keep us together,

00:21:03.512 --> 00:21:05.014
and fight to keep
their dreams alive.

00:21:05.431 --> 00:21:07.641
And, as president,
I will follow their example,

00:21:08.017 --> 00:21:10.144
and I will always fight
for the American people.

00:21:10.644 --> 00:21:12.438
And that's what I hope
my legacy will be.

00:21:12.980 --> 00:21:14.732
That was your "quick story"?

00:21:15.107 --> 00:21:17.485
You exceeded your allotted
time by, what, 20 minutes?

00:21:17.777 --> 00:21:19.487
Yes. Thank you very much.

00:21:19.737 --> 00:21:21.530
(Audience cheering
and applauding)

00:21:22.156 --> 00:21:23.796
Interviewer: Thank you,
candidate Johnson.

00:21:24.658 --> 00:21:25.761
Let's move on
to the next question.

00:21:25.785 --> 00:21:26.786
(Chuckles)

00:21:26.869 --> 00:21:27.870
(Smacks lips)
