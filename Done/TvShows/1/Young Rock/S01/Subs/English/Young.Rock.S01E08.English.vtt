WEBVTT

00:00:16.391 --> 00:00:17.893
How's the energy? Notgood.

00:00:17.976 --> 00:00:19.394
People are very upset.

00:00:19.478 --> 00:00:20.479
And our polling numbers?

00:00:20.562 --> 00:00:21.855
Down in the northeast.

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:23.065
Let's hope this works.

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.987
Well, let me start by saying
how deeply sorry I am.

00:00:29.071 --> 00:00:32.032
I made a mistake yesterday
here while at a campaign stop

00:00:32.115 --> 00:00:34.409
at Philly's prize.

00:00:34.493 --> 00:00:38.080
I ordered a cheesesteak...
Protein style.

00:00:38.163 --> 00:00:39.331
(Camera shutter clicks)

00:00:39.414 --> 00:00:40.791
(Crowd booing)

00:00:40.874 --> 00:00:43.126
The amoroso roll
locks in the flavor!

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:44.503
You're right to be upset,

00:00:44.586 --> 00:00:46.630
and I never meant
to disrespect anyone

00:00:46.713 --> 00:00:49.758
by eating a bowl
of meat and whiz.

00:00:49.841 --> 00:00:51.802
(Crowd booing)

00:00:51.885 --> 00:00:53.845
I've learned that...

00:00:53.929 --> 00:00:57.015
A person isn't defined by the
mistakes that they've made,

00:00:57.099 --> 00:00:58.725
but how they respond to them.

00:00:59.184 --> 00:01:02.145
You know, it's a lesson I
learned not too far from here

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:04.106
when I was 15,
living in Bethlehem.

00:01:05.524 --> 00:01:08.694
I was fighting, stealing, lying.

00:01:08.777 --> 00:01:10.320
You must be rich. Yeah.

00:01:10.404 --> 00:01:12.114
And all around just messing up.

00:01:12.239 --> 00:01:14.116
I can't believe it.
He stood me up.

00:01:14.199 --> 00:01:15.742
But I really liked this girl,

00:01:15.826 --> 00:01:18.662
and I was desperate for her
to give me a second chance.

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:21.790
What the hell?

00:01:21.873 --> 00:01:23.250
It's 6:15 in the morning.

00:01:23.333 --> 00:01:25.210
I know, but you won't
answer my calls.

00:01:25.419 --> 00:01:27.546
I'm sorry for standing
you up the other night.

00:01:27.629 --> 00:01:29.756
I wanted to meet you,
but I had family stuff.

00:01:30.173 --> 00:01:32.676
Please let me make it up to you.

00:01:34.177 --> 00:01:37.222
Karen, someone's
at the door for you.

00:01:38.557 --> 00:01:40.601
Dwayne, what are you doing here?

00:01:40.684 --> 00:01:42.227
It's 6:15 in the morning.

00:01:42.561 --> 00:01:43.604
What's happening?

00:01:43.687 --> 00:01:45.314
Oh, that was
my twin sister Lisa.

00:01:45.397 --> 00:01:46.648
She goes to St. Francis.

00:01:46.732 --> 00:01:47.959
She and the nuns
have been at odds

00:01:47.983 --> 00:01:49.651
so she's been
in a bad mood lately.

00:01:49.735 --> 00:01:50.878
I didn't know you had a twin.

00:01:50.902 --> 00:01:52.779
There's a lot you don't
know about me.

00:01:52.863 --> 00:01:54.740
Maybe if you'd shown up
for our date...

00:01:54.823 --> 00:01:57.826
I'm sorry. Like I told your,
your sister,

00:01:57.909 --> 00:01:59.745
I didn't mean to stand
you up, but my mom...

00:01:59.828 --> 00:02:01.371
I have to get ready forschool

00:02:05.125 --> 00:02:06.543
adult Dwayne: And my dad, well,

00:02:06.627 --> 00:02:08.629
he was trying to make up
for his own mistakes, too.

00:02:08.712 --> 00:02:11.506
Ah, cockroach!
Hey, hey, no, no, no.

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:15.510
It's not a cockroach. It's
just a Rose in full bloom.

00:02:16.136 --> 00:02:18.013
Dewey went out for an early run.

00:02:18.096 --> 00:02:20.015
We have the house to ourselves.

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:24.019
The music is playing,
and I can give you a massage.

00:02:24.102 --> 00:02:25.354
Ah, no, it's okay.

00:02:25.437 --> 00:02:27.230
I'll just sing to myself
while I stretch.

00:02:27.314 --> 00:02:28.607
We need to get ready for work.

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:31.193
Babe, I swear I wasn't partying

00:02:31.276 --> 00:02:32.861
at that wrestling convention.

00:02:32.944 --> 00:02:34.863
I had to stay overnight
for meetings.

00:02:34.946 --> 00:02:36.507
Come on, rocky, we're
all going to the bar.

00:02:36.531 --> 00:02:37.717
Soundshke an important meeting.

00:02:37.741 --> 00:02:39.326
Babe, wrestling deals are made

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:41.870
over a six pack of beer
and country...

00:02:41.953 --> 00:02:43.789
It's just hard
to hear you partying

00:02:43.872 --> 00:02:46.059
while I'm here trying to
parent our son and pay our bills,

00:02:46.083 --> 00:02:48.377
which is why we can't
be late for work.

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:50.003
You should return that Rose.

00:02:50.087 --> 00:02:52.297
We can't afford romantic
flowers right now.

00:02:52.381 --> 00:02:53.548
Babe.

00:02:57.636 --> 00:02:59.554
What are you doing?
Stop eating jam.

00:02:59.638 --> 00:03:00.847
We're out of breakfast stuff.

00:03:00.931 --> 00:03:02.474
I told you if we run
out of something,

00:03:02.557 --> 00:03:03.877
write it down
on the grocery list.

00:03:06.228 --> 00:03:08.063
I did.

00:03:08.146 --> 00:03:10.524
Morning. What's
going on? Girl troubles.

00:03:10.649 --> 00:03:12.818
Our son was eating jam
straight from the jar.

00:03:12.901 --> 00:03:14.236
(Car honks) Oh, that's Gabe.

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:15.904
Gotta go. Need a ride to school?

00:03:15.987 --> 00:03:17.781
No, no, no, no, it's cool.
I have a ride.

00:03:17.864 --> 00:03:19.700
What's up? (Engine chugging)

00:03:19.783 --> 00:03:21.076
(Horn honks)

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:24.621
Ah, this car would not be
popular with the ladies,

00:03:24.955 --> 00:03:26.915
but it would be hilarious
in a police chase.

00:03:26.998 --> 00:03:28.166
(Chuckles)

00:03:30.001 --> 00:03:32.295
Your car is a real
embarrassment, Gabe.

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:33.797
Yeah, it's kind of for work.

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:35.880
Do you think it's okay
that I left it in the alley?

00:03:35.924 --> 00:03:37.592
Oh, yeah.
Don't worry about that.

00:03:37.676 --> 00:03:39.845
Nobody touching
that piece of garbage.

00:03:39.928 --> 00:03:42.347
Now this, this is a car.

00:03:42.431 --> 00:03:44.850
See these seats?
Genuine leather.

00:03:44.933 --> 00:03:47.769
The dash,
that is tortoise shell.

00:03:47.853 --> 00:03:49.580
You know how you can tell?
'Cause of the pattern.

00:03:49.604 --> 00:03:52.482
Because of the pattern.
Real nice, Mr. Johnson.

00:03:52.566 --> 00:03:54.192
Yeah, sorry I can't
let you sit down.

00:03:54.276 --> 00:03:57.612
Next time, bring a towel
or wear pants without rivets.

00:03:57.696 --> 00:03:58.947
Oh, I'm good. Happy to hover.

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:01.783
My quads are burning,
but it's a good burn.

00:04:01.867 --> 00:04:04.244
Wait till Karen sees you
pull up to school in this car.

00:04:04.327 --> 00:04:05.370
(Chuckles)

00:04:05.454 --> 00:04:06.997
Make her forget
you stood her up.

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:08.331
Yeah. Oh.

00:04:08.415 --> 00:04:10.417
Baby's running low on fuel.

00:04:15.964 --> 00:04:17.924
Uh-oh. Oh, no.

00:04:18.008 --> 00:04:20.051
Ugh, I'm a little
light this morning.

00:04:20.135 --> 00:04:23.054
Hey, Gabe, you got a couple
extra bucks I can borrow?

00:04:23.138 --> 00:04:24.431
Oh, I got my dad's gas card

00:04:24.514 --> 00:04:26.600
but I'm only supposed to use
it for the pizza car.

00:04:26.683 --> 00:04:28.059
I won't tell if you won't.

00:04:34.024 --> 00:04:36.401
Can someone scratch
my nose for me?

00:04:37.736 --> 00:04:40.655
Rocky: Have a good day at
school, and when your friends ask,

00:04:40.739 --> 00:04:43.992
she's a 1987
Lincoln continental...

00:04:44.075 --> 00:04:46.495
(In French accent)
Givenchy designer series.

00:04:46.578 --> 00:04:47.621
(Turns up radio)

00:04:47.746 --> 00:04:48.747
Breakin' away

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:51.166
(tires screech)

00:04:51.249 --> 00:04:52.876
What an exit.

00:04:54.836 --> 00:04:56.963
No, dude, dude,
let's not walk by the field.

00:04:57.047 --> 00:04:58.673
Let's use the side
entrance. Why?

00:04:58.757 --> 00:05:00.276
The assistant football
coaches are out,

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:01.510
and they won't leave me alone.

00:05:01.593 --> 00:05:02.719
They're always harassing me.

00:05:02.803 --> 00:05:04.429
Dude, what are you
talking about?

00:05:04.513 --> 00:05:06.056
All right, fine. I'll show you.

00:05:09.184 --> 00:05:10.435
Let's go!

00:05:13.396 --> 00:05:14.564
Hey, champ.

00:05:14.648 --> 00:05:16.775
Where you walking to
on those big legs?

00:05:16.858 --> 00:05:18.819
Is your father a 747?

00:05:18.902 --> 00:05:20.612
'Cause you got
a hell of a wingspan.

00:05:20.695 --> 00:05:23.532
Damn, son, you got a body
like a fillet mignon.

00:05:23.615 --> 00:05:24.699
It's rare.

00:05:24.783 --> 00:05:26.451
Come on. Don't be like that.

00:05:26.535 --> 00:05:28.703
Just run a cone drill.
Five minutes.

00:05:28.787 --> 00:05:30.622
Hey, knock it off,
will you, guys?

00:05:30.705 --> 00:05:32.082
Leave the kid alone.

00:05:32.165 --> 00:05:33.375
Man: Sorry, coach cwik.

00:05:34.251 --> 00:05:35.585
Unbelievable, right?

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:37.629
What's the big deal, man?
They want you to play.

00:05:37.712 --> 00:05:39.440
Young Dwayne: Man, the only
game I'm interested in playing

00:05:39.464 --> 00:05:41.091
is trying to get
another shot with Karen.

00:05:41.174 --> 00:05:44.219
Gabe: Ah, so you playing
the deadliest game, love.

00:05:48.807 --> 00:05:52.143
Rocky: What the...
What are y'all staring at?

00:05:55.605 --> 00:05:58.066
What are you doing?
Diane won't notice.

00:05:58.149 --> 00:06:00.389
You sound just like Dewey.
She's definitely gonna notice.

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:03.738
Uh-oh, they're the wrong way.

00:06:03.822 --> 00:06:06.157
They should be face
fonnard, burn to the wall.

00:06:06.241 --> 00:06:07.951
I like to feel seen.

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:12.289
Wow, this place looks so
great, and so fast.

00:06:12.372 --> 00:06:13.748
Well, we have four hands now,

00:06:13.832 --> 00:06:15.601
so we'll be able to
get things done a lot quicker.

00:06:15.625 --> 00:06:17.419
Ata, can I talk
to you for a minute?

00:06:20.505 --> 00:06:22.215
I'm finally going
to the galapagos!

00:06:22.299 --> 00:06:23.383
(Gasps)

00:06:23.508 --> 00:06:25.611
I'm going to be part of
an immersive nature experience

00:06:25.635 --> 00:06:28.013
where you observe wildlife
up close, like dan/vin.

00:06:28.096 --> 00:06:30.724
I have to get special shoes
so I don't slip on the rocks.

00:06:30.807 --> 00:06:32.475
Oh, my god, that's amazing.

00:06:32.559 --> 00:06:33.828
I told you you needed
to treat yourself.

00:06:33.852 --> 00:06:35.937
I'll be gone two months.

00:06:36.021 --> 00:06:38.773
I know that money is a concern
so I wanna pay you extra today

00:06:38.857 --> 00:06:40.692
along with all the
perishables in my fridge.

00:06:40.775 --> 00:06:42.360
Oh, no, no,
that's not necessary.

00:06:42.444 --> 00:06:43.612
I insist,

00:06:43.695 --> 00:06:45.255
and I'll call you
the moment I get back.

00:06:45.447 --> 00:06:47.407
Oh, have a great trip.

00:06:49.534 --> 00:06:51.077
I hope you like root vegetables

00:06:51.161 --> 00:06:53.204
because I went crazy
at the farmers market.

00:06:53.288 --> 00:06:54.706
I was shopping nervous.

00:06:57.334 --> 00:07:00.795
Well, if you're gonna stare,
I'ma give you a show.

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:03.423
Oh, there it is. (Grunts)

00:07:03.506 --> 00:07:05.091
(Laughs)

00:07:05.175 --> 00:07:07.093
(School bell rings)

00:07:07.177 --> 00:07:09.057
(Girls whispering)
No, we're not talking to him.

00:07:10.597 --> 00:07:12.724
Hi, can I speak to Karen
for a second?

00:07:12.807 --> 00:07:14.351
Are you gonna be okay, Karen?

00:07:14.476 --> 00:07:16.144
I'm okay. Thanks, Karen.

00:07:16.353 --> 00:07:17.938
Karen's strong.

00:07:18.021 --> 00:07:19.189
Bonnie out.

00:07:19.272 --> 00:07:20.649
But Bonnie watching.

00:07:23.818 --> 00:07:26.196
I'm so sorry for bailing
on dinner the other night.

00:07:26.279 --> 00:07:27.530
Please give me a second chance.

00:07:27.614 --> 00:07:32.494
Here, I got you something
to apologize.

00:07:38.875 --> 00:07:40.669
I love animals
wearing sunglasses.

00:07:40.752 --> 00:07:42.295
I know. You told me

00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:45.131
when we watched the tonight
showtogether on the phone.

00:07:45.215 --> 00:07:47.384
Okay, I'll give you
another chance.

00:07:47.467 --> 00:07:48.927
Yes! Babe, that's amazing.

00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:51.030
If you show me that you take
this relationship seriously.

00:07:51.054 --> 00:07:52.055
Yeah.

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:54.599
Have me over for dinner with
your parents Friday night.

00:07:54.683 --> 00:07:56.768
Why? Haven't you
already met my dad?

00:07:56.851 --> 00:07:59.312
For, like, one second.
I wanna meet your mom.

00:07:59.646 --> 00:08:01.022
And I'm not getting
stood up again,

00:08:01.106 --> 00:08:03.483
so I'm coming to where you live.

00:08:03.566 --> 00:08:04.901
Look, I like you,

00:08:04.985 --> 00:08:06.671
but either you think
I'm parent-meeting material,

00:08:06.695 --> 00:08:08.738
or we're done.

00:08:08.822 --> 00:08:10.782
Okay, fine.
I'll pick you up at 6:00.

00:08:10.865 --> 00:08:11.992
5:30.

00:08:12.075 --> 00:08:13.511
I'm doing this thing
where I don't eat lunch,

00:08:13.535 --> 00:08:14.661
so I'll be a grump by 6:00.

00:08:16.162 --> 00:08:17.914
See you Friday.

00:08:23.044 --> 00:08:24.939
Karen wants to come over
and have dinner with my parents.

00:08:24.963 --> 00:08:27.507
Yo, that's great, man!
No, dude, it's terrible.

00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:28.883
She thinks I'm rich.

00:08:28.967 --> 00:08:30.361
She's gonna find out
I've been lying.

00:08:30.385 --> 00:08:32.721
She can't see where I live.
It's embarrassing.

00:08:32.804 --> 00:08:34.524
Well, dude, maybe she
won't care about that.

00:08:34.597 --> 00:08:35.783
She's gonna care about it, man.

00:08:35.807 --> 00:08:37.100
You haven't seen her house.

00:08:37.183 --> 00:08:39.978
Looks like the bad guy's house
in a kid's movie.

00:08:40.061 --> 00:08:41.771
God, I gotta find a bathroom.

00:08:41.855 --> 00:08:43.189
Oh, anxiety butt?

00:08:43.273 --> 00:08:45.150
I had that bad
during psats, dude.

00:08:45.233 --> 00:08:46.526
Boy's room is right over there.

00:08:46.609 --> 00:08:48.611
Those stalls are too small.

00:08:52.866 --> 00:08:55.326
Only seven weeks
till spring break.

00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:57.037
Let's not talk, man.

00:08:57.245 --> 00:08:58.496
Yeah.

00:08:59.539 --> 00:09:00.790
Whatever. I'll catch you later.

00:09:00.874 --> 00:09:02.625
All right. Take it slow.

00:09:02.709 --> 00:09:05.754
Adult Dwayne: The thought of
Karen coming over was messing me up.

00:09:07.297 --> 00:09:08.798
Unfortunately,
I made the mistake

00:09:08.882 --> 00:09:10.550
of taking it out
on the wrong person.

00:09:11.134 --> 00:09:12.135
Coach cwik.

00:09:12.218 --> 00:09:13.636
What the hell
are you doing in here?

00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:14.880
This is the teachers' lounge!

00:09:14.929 --> 00:09:16.409
I'm too big for the
regular bathrooms.

00:09:16.473 --> 00:09:17.807
Boy, you better
get the hell out.

00:09:17.891 --> 00:09:19.601
No one else is
even in here. Out.

00:09:20.268 --> 00:09:21.603
Man, today is not the day.

00:09:21.686 --> 00:09:25.815
Make me say it one more time,
we'll have a real problem.

00:09:25.899 --> 00:09:26.900
Okay, sure.

00:09:27.192 --> 00:09:29.819
If ileave_.
After I wash my hands.

00:09:31.279 --> 00:09:33.823
Oh, you're gonna be
a son of a bitch?

00:09:33.907 --> 00:09:35.241
I'll call the principal.

00:09:35.325 --> 00:09:36.785
Principal Bogg? Uh-huh.

00:09:36.868 --> 00:09:39.079
Tell him officer Dwayne
Johnson said what's up.

00:09:40.371 --> 00:09:42.165
Pass me a paper towel.

00:09:42.582 --> 00:09:44.417
Know what, never mind.
I'll get my own.

00:09:46.377 --> 00:09:48.046
Get out!

00:09:50.715 --> 00:09:52.050
Later, boss.

00:09:57.764 --> 00:09:59.182
Do you want me to put in a tape?

00:09:59.265 --> 00:10:02.477
I got some Neil diamond,
earth, wind &amp; fire...

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:05.021
Why do I feel like I'm the
only one who's worried?

00:10:05.105 --> 00:10:06.815
Diane was our
twice-a-week client.

00:10:06.898 --> 00:10:09.859
Losing her is a big hit,
and rent is due next week.

00:10:09.943 --> 00:10:12.737
Babe, we always figure this out.

00:10:12.821 --> 00:10:14.906
I'm gonna see of a and sika
at the gym later.

00:10:14.989 --> 00:10:16.801
I'll see if they got
any local matches coming up.

00:10:16.825 --> 00:10:18.469
And we should ask around,
find out if anyone

00:10:18.493 --> 00:10:20.078
needs a cleaning service. Mmm.

00:10:20.161 --> 00:10:22.705
Maybe put an ad in the paper,
although that costs money.

00:10:23.623 --> 00:10:25.792
Everything costs money.

00:10:26.793 --> 00:10:28.378
This bag smells.

00:10:29.504 --> 00:10:31.756
You called him boss after
you shoulder-checked him?

00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:34.217
Power move.
I was just pissed off.

00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:36.219
It's this Karen dinner.
It's making me crazy.

00:10:36.302 --> 00:10:38.030
Well, did you tell your
parents she's coming over?

00:10:38.054 --> 00:10:39.374
I'll tell my dad
at the gym later.

00:10:39.430 --> 00:10:40.991
Maybe he can help me
figure out what to do.

00:10:41.015 --> 00:10:42.183
Maybe if you ask your mom

00:10:42.267 --> 00:10:43.786
to make you something
fancy for dinner,

00:10:43.810 --> 00:10:45.770
then Karen won't
notice your apartment.

00:10:45.854 --> 00:10:47.564
Fancy like what?
Like Turkey burgers?

00:10:47.647 --> 00:10:49.482
Turkey burgers?

00:10:49.566 --> 00:10:50.793
You give a girl a Turkey burger,

00:10:50.817 --> 00:10:51.985
she should spit in your face.

00:10:52.068 --> 00:10:53.820
I mean, you can make it classy,

00:10:53.903 --> 00:10:55.381
you know, with, like,
a salad or something.

00:10:55.405 --> 00:10:57.824
Turkey makes you sleep,
and it makes you fart, Dwayne.

00:10:57.907 --> 00:10:59.576
You looking to sleep and fart,

00:10:59.659 --> 00:11:01.119
or you looking
to have a little fun?

00:11:01.202 --> 00:11:02.996
Fine. Then what should we have?

00:11:03.079 --> 00:11:05.373
I got three words,
iinguini and clams.

00:11:05.456 --> 00:11:07.709
Nah, I don't think...
Listen to me.

00:11:07.792 --> 00:11:09.586
Women go wild for
iinguini and clams.

00:11:09.669 --> 00:11:11.171
Clams are an aphrodisiac.

00:11:11.254 --> 00:11:14.465
Something about them on top of
iinguini drives women crazy.

00:11:14.549 --> 00:11:17.594
Something in the sauce,
it mixes with their DNA.

00:11:17.677 --> 00:11:19.179
I don't know
'cause I'm not a doctor.

00:11:19.262 --> 00:11:20.722
I don't know
if it's the electrons

00:11:20.805 --> 00:11:22.098
or the hormones or what,

00:11:22.182 --> 00:11:23.766
but when clam juice and iinguini

00:11:23.850 --> 00:11:24.976
hits a woman's bloodstream,

00:11:25.059 --> 00:11:26.436
huh... (Chuckles)

00:11:26.519 --> 00:11:28.062
All hell breaks loose.

00:11:28.146 --> 00:11:30.273
If it works so good, then why
isn't it on our menu?

00:11:30.356 --> 00:11:32.442
'Cause we don't have
insurance for that!

00:11:32.525 --> 00:11:35.278
A bunch of crazy women
ripping our seats out?

00:11:35.361 --> 00:11:37.197
Come on!

00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:38.823
(Quietly) Sorry.

00:11:39.782 --> 00:11:42.702
(Retro pop music)

00:11:44.204 --> 00:11:45.580
Ata.

00:11:45.663 --> 00:11:47.457
Hi. Look, before
you say anything,

00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:48.958
Toby's been let go.

00:11:49.042 --> 00:11:50.186
We had no idea about his history

00:11:50.210 --> 00:11:52.128
when we hired him,
and what can I say?

00:11:52.212 --> 00:11:55.506
He's a master
manipulator. Who's Toby?

00:11:55.590 --> 00:11:56.966
So you're here for a class?

00:11:57.050 --> 00:12:00.470
No, actually, I need to
cancel my platinum jazz plan.

00:12:01.846 --> 00:12:04.182
It's not that I
don't love it. I do.

00:12:04.265 --> 00:12:05.865
It's just a bit too
much money right now.

00:12:05.934 --> 00:12:07.810
Oh, okay.

00:12:07.894 --> 00:12:09.574
Um, I don't know if
you read the fine print

00:12:09.646 --> 00:12:11.022
on your jazzport
membership card,

00:12:11.105 --> 00:12:12.690
but there are no refunds.

00:12:12.774 --> 00:12:14.484
Come on, Stephanie. It's me.

00:12:17.237 --> 00:12:19.781
Okay, I am not
supposed to do this,

00:12:19.864 --> 00:12:21.658
but I can offer you

00:12:21.741 --> 00:12:23.701
10% off your next platinum plan

00:12:23.785 --> 00:12:24.994
if you renew today.

00:12:25.078 --> 00:12:26.955
We take cash, check,
or credit card.

00:12:27.038 --> 00:12:28.358
The only thing
we no longer accept

00:12:28.414 --> 00:12:29.457
is Toby bucks.

00:12:32.585 --> 00:12:33.628
Hey. Fellas.

00:12:33.711 --> 00:12:35.755
Hey, y'all talk to hal?

00:12:35.838 --> 00:12:37.674
He got any local matches
on the horizon?

00:12:37.757 --> 00:12:39.259
Nah, he's got nothing coming up.

00:12:39.342 --> 00:12:42.845
Hmm, all right, well, you hear
anything, let me know.

00:12:44.305 --> 00:12:45.431
Hey, dad.

00:12:45.515 --> 00:12:48.017
Uncle of a, uncle sika.
Hello, Dewey.

00:12:48.101 --> 00:12:51.813
Dewey, give me a spot.
Mustache coming in strong.

00:12:51.896 --> 00:12:54.023
That weight was too light.

00:12:54.107 --> 00:12:55.441
Hey, I need to
ask you something.

00:12:56.693 --> 00:12:58.194
I got a problem with this girl.

00:12:59.404 --> 00:13:02.782
Oh. Uh, okay.

00:13:02.865 --> 00:13:04.701
You and this lady had some fun,

00:13:04.784 --> 00:13:06.845
but now there are consequences,
and you need help dealing...

00:13:06.869 --> 00:13:09.706
No, dad, Karen wants to come
over for dinner tomorrow night.

00:13:09.789 --> 00:13:12.041
(Chuckles)

00:13:12.125 --> 00:13:13.835
Well, I'm relieved
to hear that, son.

00:13:13.918 --> 00:13:15.271
You scared me
for a second, there, Dewey.

00:13:15.295 --> 00:13:17.005
What a wild few
seconds that was.

00:13:17.088 --> 00:13:19.215
But her family's rich,
and I sort of led her

00:13:19.299 --> 00:13:21.217
to believe that I was
rich too, and now...

00:13:21.301 --> 00:13:23.177
The chickens have
come home to roost.

00:13:23.261 --> 00:13:25.430
(Chuckles) I understand.

00:13:25.513 --> 00:13:27.449
You were working a gimmick,
and you cornered yourself.

00:13:27.473 --> 00:13:29.326
I guess I should just come
clean to her then, right?

00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:30.560
Wrong, son.

00:13:30.643 --> 00:13:31.894
What you gotta do

00:13:31.978 --> 00:13:34.856
is work the gimmick even harder.

00:13:41.612 --> 00:13:43.281
(Doorbell rings)

00:13:48.036 --> 00:13:50.204
'Sup, Karen?

00:13:50.288 --> 00:13:51.414
Or Lisa?

00:13:51.497 --> 00:13:53.541
No, it's me, Karen.

00:13:53.624 --> 00:13:54.852
Lisa's in a room
with my parents.

00:13:54.876 --> 00:13:56.919
She just told them
she's a lesbian.

00:13:57.003 --> 00:13:58.171
Nice car.

00:13:58.254 --> 00:14:02.133
Thanks. It's a Lincoln continental
givenchy designer series.

00:14:02.216 --> 00:14:03.652
I've never seen you
drive this to school.

00:14:03.676 --> 00:14:05.553
You know, a lot of kids
bombing around there

00:14:05.636 --> 00:14:06.929
with their learner's permits.

00:14:07.013 --> 00:14:08.514
I don't trust them
around my baby.

00:14:10.183 --> 00:14:11.225
I brought eclairs.

00:14:11.309 --> 00:14:13.394
The cream is called chantilly,

00:14:13.478 --> 00:14:15.396
which is also what I want
to call my daughter.

00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:16.939
Beautiful.

00:14:19.192 --> 00:14:21.277
(Upbeat pop music
playing on radio)

00:14:21.361 --> 00:14:24.072
I'm planning to go
to barbizon modeling school

00:14:24.155 --> 00:14:26.824
after I graduate.
That makes sense!

00:14:26.908 --> 00:14:28.284
You're so pretty!

00:14:28.368 --> 00:14:29.577
Thank you.

00:14:29.660 --> 00:14:31.371
Can we turn this music down?

00:14:33.081 --> 00:14:34.624
Sorry, I was just
trying to show you

00:14:34.707 --> 00:14:35.958
the six-speaker stereo.

00:14:36.042 --> 00:14:37.293
Most cars only have four so...

00:14:37.377 --> 00:14:39.587
Anyway, I got discovered
eating a chocolate bar

00:14:39.670 --> 00:14:40.838
at hershey park.

00:14:40.922 --> 00:14:42.232
I'm planning on being
a catalog model

00:14:42.256 --> 00:14:43.383
because they don't have

00:14:43.466 --> 00:14:44.986
the same height
requirements as runway,

00:14:45.051 --> 00:14:46.153
and I'm business-minded
about it.

00:14:46.177 --> 00:14:47.470
You comfortable?

00:14:47.553 --> 00:14:49.430
These seats are genuine leather.

00:14:49.514 --> 00:14:51.933
And you see this dash?
Tortoise shell.

00:14:52.016 --> 00:14:53.601
Mmm-hmm, yeah.

00:14:53.684 --> 00:14:55.812
So how far is it to your house?

00:14:55.895 --> 00:14:57.146
Instead of going to my house,

00:14:57.230 --> 00:14:58.670
I thought we could
just drive around,

00:14:58.731 --> 00:15:00.274
enjoy the elegance of my conty.

00:15:00.358 --> 00:15:02.944
Dwayne, I told you
I didn't eat lunch.

00:15:03.027 --> 00:15:04.404
I'm gonna need some food.

00:15:04.570 --> 00:15:05.738
No problem.

00:15:05.822 --> 00:15:07.323
I got us a reservation

00:15:07.407 --> 00:15:09.534
at the most romantic
spot in the city.

00:15:11.077 --> 00:15:12.245
(Wind whooshing)

00:15:12.328 --> 00:15:13.830
Isn't this picnic nice?

00:15:13.913 --> 00:15:15.832
You enjoying your
iinguini with clams?

00:15:15.915 --> 00:15:18.543
No, the wind blew dirt in it.

00:15:18.626 --> 00:15:20.711
Yeah, I guess it really
does pick up at night.

00:15:20.795 --> 00:15:22.880
Here, have some of mine.

00:15:22.964 --> 00:15:25.258
Watch out with that fork.
You're really close to my eyes.

00:15:25.341 --> 00:15:26.342
Stop!

00:15:26.467 --> 00:15:29.137
Sorry, it's just
so dark. Hold on.

00:15:33.474 --> 00:15:35.685
Dwayne!

00:15:35.768 --> 00:15:38.146
Oh, no, here comes the moths.

00:15:38.229 --> 00:15:40.982
(Screams, spitting)

00:15:41.065 --> 00:15:42.692
The lights, turn off the lights!

00:15:45.945 --> 00:15:47.989
Okay, we can eat in the car,

00:15:48.072 --> 00:15:49.824
but we really can't spill
on the seats.

00:15:50.158 --> 00:15:53.161
I wanna have dinner at
your house with your parents!

00:15:53.244 --> 00:15:54.964
I was looking fonnard
to your mom cooking us

00:15:55.037 --> 00:15:56.873
a traditional meal from your...

00:15:56.956 --> 00:15:58.708
Homeland of origin.

00:15:58.791 --> 00:16:00.042
She's from Samoa.

00:16:00.126 --> 00:16:03.880
That is what I want.
Some lovely Samoan food.

00:16:03.963 --> 00:16:07.550
Take me to your house
or take me home.

00:16:09.469 --> 00:16:12.555
Okay, fine. Let's go
to my house.

00:16:13.764 --> 00:16:14.891
Here we are.

00:16:16.142 --> 00:16:20.146
Let me just...
Oh, I forgot my house key.

00:16:20.229 --> 00:16:21.397
My mom hates it

00:16:21.481 --> 00:16:22.875
when I ring the doorbell
late at night.

00:16:22.899 --> 00:16:23.941
It disturbs the horses.

00:16:24.025 --> 00:16:25.419
I guess we got
to do this another time.

00:16:25.443 --> 00:16:27.695
Dwayne, this is
the mayor's house.

00:16:27.778 --> 00:16:29.465
I know that because I
threw up here on a field trip

00:16:29.489 --> 00:16:31.782
after I ate too many
circus peanuts.

00:16:31.866 --> 00:16:33.701
All right, fine.

00:16:33.784 --> 00:16:35.870
I don't wanna take you
to my house, okay?

00:16:35.953 --> 00:16:38.247
I know you think I'm rich
because I wear nice clothes

00:16:38.331 --> 00:16:41.042
and my dad is famous,
but I'm not.

00:16:41.125 --> 00:16:42.418
We live in a crappy apartment,

00:16:42.502 --> 00:16:44.170
and my mom cleans houses
with my dad

00:16:44.253 --> 00:16:45.379
when he's not lucky enough

00:16:45.463 --> 00:16:46.690
to be wrestling in flea markets.

00:16:46.714 --> 00:16:48.216
I didn't wanna tell you
because you

00:16:48.299 --> 00:16:49.485
obviously wouldn't understand.

00:16:49.509 --> 00:16:51.636
Your house is perfect.
You're perfect.

00:16:51.719 --> 00:16:54.680
And... yeah.

00:16:57.433 --> 00:16:59.393
Do I like that you're poor? No.

00:16:59.477 --> 00:17:02.021
But I hate that you
lied to me about it.

00:17:03.189 --> 00:17:05.441
So, yeah, maybe I am
a little shallow.

00:17:07.235 --> 00:17:09.612
You didn't even
give me a chance.

00:17:09.987 --> 00:17:11.656
Take me home.

00:17:11.739 --> 00:17:13.157
For real this time.

00:17:18.287 --> 00:17:21.123
You know what?
This wasn't half bad.

00:17:21.207 --> 00:17:22.792
It's turnip pie. You want
another piece?

00:17:22.875 --> 00:17:26.128
No. I mean, uh, I'm so full.

00:17:26.212 --> 00:17:27.755
This jazzercise
contract is crazy.

00:17:27.838 --> 00:17:29.316
I don't think there's
any way out of it.

00:17:29.340 --> 00:17:30.383
Listen to this.

00:17:30.508 --> 00:17:33.052
"Every dispute will be
settled by Christine."

00:17:33.135 --> 00:17:35.304
Is she the one
with the thick back?

00:17:35.388 --> 00:17:37.640
There he is. How'd that date go?

00:17:37.723 --> 00:17:39.600
Terrible. I don't understand.

00:17:39.684 --> 00:17:41.495
Did you double down
on the gimmick like I said?

00:17:41.519 --> 00:17:43.145
Yeah, and it blew up in my face.

00:17:43.229 --> 00:17:44.480
What's going on?

00:17:44.564 --> 00:17:46.208
Dad told me to work
the gimmick extra hard,

00:17:46.232 --> 00:17:47.752
and it backfired,
so now Karen hates me

00:17:47.817 --> 00:17:52.113
and the mayor's security team
has our license plate number.

00:17:52.196 --> 00:17:54.323
Why do we have red celery?

00:17:54.407 --> 00:17:56.701
Okay, it's rhubarb
from the farmers market,

00:17:56.784 --> 00:17:57.910
and we're all gonna eat it.

00:17:57.994 --> 00:17:59.996
I need you two to stop
working the gimmick

00:18:00.079 --> 00:18:01.747
and start working on a solution,

00:18:01.831 --> 00:18:04.625
a real solution because we've
got real problems

00:18:04.709 --> 00:18:06.168
like rent being due
in a few days.

00:18:06.252 --> 00:18:07.712
We could get evicted.

00:18:07.795 --> 00:18:10.256
That should be your priority,
not what some girl thinks.

00:18:15.469 --> 00:18:17.638
Whatever that is, son...

00:18:17.722 --> 00:18:18.931
Don't eat it.

00:18:29.692 --> 00:18:31.193
Where's your car?

00:18:31.777 --> 00:18:32.862
I sold it.

00:18:32.945 --> 00:18:34.780
What do you mean you sold it?

00:18:34.864 --> 00:18:36.866
And I got good money for it too.

00:18:36.949 --> 00:18:38.576
You know, it's a givenchy...

00:18:38.659 --> 00:18:39.869
Designer series, yes, I know.

00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:42.413
Rocky, I can't believe
you sold your car.

00:18:42.496 --> 00:18:44.665
You love it so much.
We needed to pay rent.

00:18:44.749 --> 00:18:47.293
I can ride with of a and sika
if I book any shows,

00:18:47.376 --> 00:18:49.420
and we can sign
a cheap lease on a Van,

00:18:49.503 --> 00:18:51.881
which will be better
for the business.

00:18:51.964 --> 00:18:53.132
I'm working the solution.

00:18:56.218 --> 00:19:00.431
Hey, can you drop me off
at school on your way to work?

00:19:02.975 --> 00:19:05.061
Thanks for giving us
a ride to work, Gabe.

00:19:05.144 --> 00:19:08.314
No problem. I have some parmesan
and crushed red pepper packets

00:19:08.397 --> 00:19:10.524
in the glove box if
anyone's feeling snacky.

00:19:10.608 --> 00:19:12.360
It's crazy you had
to sell your car, dad.

00:19:12.443 --> 00:19:13.569
You loved that thing.

00:19:13.653 --> 00:19:17.573
Yeah, but I love
your mom even more.

00:19:17.657 --> 00:19:20.993
It's about
taking responsibility.

00:19:21.661 --> 00:19:24.705
Adult Dwayne: What my dad said
really resonated with me.

00:19:24.789 --> 00:19:26.582
I had messed up
things with Karen,

00:19:26.666 --> 00:19:28.584
but I still had a shot
to do something right.

00:19:28.668 --> 00:19:32.254
Hey, coach cwik,
you got a second?

00:19:32.338 --> 00:19:34.256
Hey, big fella. Looking big!

00:19:34.340 --> 00:19:35.508
Not now, Barry.

00:19:37.009 --> 00:19:38.928
I know I acted like a jerk.

00:19:39.011 --> 00:19:41.097
I've been stressed lately
about a lot of things,

00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:44.266
and I took it out on you,
and I'm sorry.

00:19:53.526 --> 00:19:55.111
I appreciate that.

00:19:55.194 --> 00:19:57.321
I appreciate that
apology very much.

00:19:57.405 --> 00:19:59.907
Tells me who you are,
right, as a man.

00:19:59.990 --> 00:20:01.575
Thanks for giving me
another chance.

00:20:01.659 --> 00:20:04.328
Hey, we all deserve
a second chance.

00:20:07.707 --> 00:20:09.834
Why don't you
play football for me?

00:20:10.668 --> 00:20:12.753
Coach, I don't got
time for that.

00:20:12.837 --> 00:20:14.130
I mean, my family...

00:20:14.213 --> 00:20:16.191
Hey, I don't want to cross
a line here or anything.

00:20:16.215 --> 00:20:17.655
You live out
in the east side, right?

00:20:19.927 --> 00:20:22.346
I grew up around there too.

00:20:22.430 --> 00:20:25.391
Football can open doors
for guys like us.

00:20:25.474 --> 00:20:27.184
This game can get you
into college,

00:20:27.268 --> 00:20:29.061
take you who knows how far.

00:20:29.145 --> 00:20:30.688
Out there is opportunity.

00:20:30.771 --> 00:20:33.232
You work your ass off,
give yourself a chance.

00:20:34.817 --> 00:20:36.193
You really think I got a shot?

00:20:36.277 --> 00:20:37.486
You got the size.

00:20:37.570 --> 00:20:40.197
If you got the talent,
sky's the limit.

00:20:43.242 --> 00:20:45.119
All right. I'll be
here tomorrow.

00:20:45.202 --> 00:20:46.829
Good for you.

00:20:46.912 --> 00:20:48.622
Hey, that's it, Marcus!

00:20:48.706 --> 00:20:50.767
Adult Dwayne: You know, when
you give someone a second chance,

00:20:50.791 --> 00:20:52.668
you never know how
they could surprise you.

00:20:52.752 --> 00:20:54.420
If I hadn't apologized
to coach cwik,

00:20:54.503 --> 00:20:55.963
I never would
have found football,

00:20:56.046 --> 00:20:57.339
and football gave me direction.

00:20:57.423 --> 00:20:59.592
It gave me discipline,
but, most of all,

00:20:59.675 --> 00:21:02.094
it gave me hope for
a better future for my family.

00:21:02.178 --> 00:21:04.180
Go eagles!

00:21:04.263 --> 00:21:05.431
I didn't know it then,

00:21:05.514 --> 00:21:08.976
but that moment,
that apology when I was 15,

00:21:09.059 --> 00:21:11.729
well, that changed
the course of my life.

00:21:11.812 --> 00:21:14.315
We all deserve a chance
to learn from our mistakes,

00:21:14.398 --> 00:21:15.691
and I hope the people of Philly

00:21:15.775 --> 00:21:17.985
will give me a second chance
to make them proud.

00:21:18.068 --> 00:21:20.946
(Cheers and applause)

00:21:25.826 --> 00:21:27.995
Go eagles!
