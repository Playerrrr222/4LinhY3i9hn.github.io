WEBVTT

00:00:07.758 --> 00:00:08.759
Hi, I'm Kenny Smith

00:00:08.842 --> 00:00:10.761
and welcome to young
athletes and the road ahead

00:00:10.928 --> 00:00:14.806
brought to you by nbc and our proud
sponsor beyond protein. (Cow moos)

00:00:15.015 --> 00:00:16.391
Where's the beef?

00:00:16.475 --> 00:00:19.186
On the cow where it belongs.

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:20.270
Thanks, beyonde.

00:00:20.354 --> 00:00:22.022
And tonight we have
our special guest,

00:00:22.231 --> 00:00:24.650
presidential candidate
Dwayne Johnson.

00:00:24.816 --> 00:00:26.652
Kenny, always good to see you,
my man,

00:00:26.735 --> 00:00:28.237
and looking crisp as always.

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.113
And good to
see you too, beyonde.

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:34.451
Where are my lettuce lovers at?
(Adult Dwayne chuckles)

00:00:34.618 --> 00:00:36.554
So, as you know, our show
focuses on the challenges

00:00:36.578 --> 00:00:38.455
that young athletes
face off the field.

00:00:38.539 --> 00:00:39.599
That's right.
And you didn't start

00:00:39.623 --> 00:00:42.125
playing football till
yourjunior year of high school,

00:00:42.209 --> 00:00:43.877
and it took you
to one of the top college

00:00:43.961 --> 00:00:45.504
football programs
in the country.

00:00:45.754 --> 00:00:48.090
The u, baby!
The university of Miami.

00:00:48.298 --> 00:00:50.092
Say itwith me, Kenny.
I know you want to.

00:00:50.259 --> 00:00:51.802
Tar heel born, tar heel bred.

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:53.971
And when I die,
I'll be tar heel dead.

00:00:54.054 --> 00:00:56.557
Wow, dead.
That's some commitment.

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.225
You know, when you think back,

00:00:58.308 --> 00:01:00.477
is there anything that
you've learned about adversity

00:01:00.686 --> 00:01:02.205
that you would say sticks
with you today?

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:03.605
Oh, yeah. I remember facing

00:01:03.689 --> 00:01:05.857
one of the toughest
challenges of my life.

00:01:05.941 --> 00:01:07.252
When I got to
the university of Miami,

00:01:07.276 --> 00:01:08.819
it was in 1990,
and I was a freshman.

00:01:08.902 --> 00:01:13.240
And I was joining the reigning
defending national champions.

00:01:13.323 --> 00:01:14.467
Let me tell you
something, brother.

00:01:14.491 --> 00:01:17.619
We were the baddest pack of
dogs walking god's green earth.

00:01:17.703 --> 00:01:20.539
The plan was to become a
starter, kick ass on Saturdays,

00:01:20.622 --> 00:01:21.915
get drafted by the NFL,

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:24.751
and buy my parents
their first-ever home.

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.297
Speaking of,
when I left for Miami,

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:29.941
my parents shut down
their cleaning business

00:01:29.965 --> 00:01:33.093
in Pennsylvania and moved
to tampa to be close by.

00:01:33.635 --> 00:01:35.178
Dewey trying to look so tough.

00:01:35.262 --> 00:01:37.556
He only smiles
for his mama's cooking.

00:01:37.639 --> 00:01:38.890
Adult Dwayne: Love you, mom.

00:01:38.974 --> 00:01:40.183
Now, unfortunately,

00:01:40.267 --> 00:01:42.060
my grandmother Lia
became homeless

00:01:42.144 --> 00:01:44.062
and was in Samoa at the time.

00:01:44.146 --> 00:01:45.897
She was deported,
lost everything,

00:01:45.981 --> 00:01:47.899
and she was very sad.

00:01:47.983 --> 00:01:50.652
We eventually got her back into
the country and back on her feet,

00:01:50.736 --> 00:01:53.155
but that's a story for
another time.

00:01:53.322 --> 00:01:55.407
My dad got a job
driving a liquor truck.

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:58.368
And he loved telling everyone
who his son played for.

00:01:58.452 --> 00:01:59.745
Hey, everybody,

00:01:59.911 --> 00:02:03.665
let me know if you need
Miami hurricane tickets.

00:02:03.749 --> 00:02:05.542
My boy's on the team. (Laughs)

00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:08.462
I'll take some tickets.
Can I get ten?

00:02:08.545 --> 00:02:10.756
Ten? Greedy, Larry.

00:02:12.382 --> 00:02:13.651
Adult Dwayne: My mom
also worked,

00:02:13.675 --> 00:02:17.721
but her number one job
was worrying about me.

00:02:17.971 --> 00:02:20.140
She was never
far from my mind...

00:02:20.223 --> 00:02:21.850
(Players grunting)

00:02:22.851 --> 00:02:24.353
And neither was
the promise I made

00:02:24.436 --> 00:02:25.771
when we lived in Bethlehem.

00:02:25.896 --> 00:02:27.981
I wanted to give her
and my dad a better life.

00:02:28.231 --> 00:02:31.610
And reminders of that
better life were everywhere.

00:02:31.777 --> 00:02:33.654
Practice at the u was intense.

00:02:33.737 --> 00:02:35.530
And you had
a lot of eyes on you.

00:02:37.366 --> 00:02:38.492
(Rap music playing)

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.039
Man: (Rapping) From a
rebel it's final on black vinyl

00:02:44.373 --> 00:02:46.750
soul, rock and roll
coming like a rhino

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:50.796
coach orgeron:
Okay, guys, circle up!

00:02:52.297 --> 00:02:54.383
Oklahoma drill!

00:02:56.301 --> 00:02:57.302
Cristobal!

00:03:00.514 --> 00:03:01.991
Coach orgeron: Freshman,
let's see ifyou're

00:03:02.015 --> 00:03:03.684
a candyass or a hardass.

00:03:03.767 --> 00:03:04.935
(Players cheering)

00:03:05.727 --> 00:03:08.271
Hey, you, get me
some coffee grounds to chew.

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.774
I am tired as a one-legged
cat in a sandbox.

00:03:10.857 --> 00:03:12.150
Yes, coach orgeron.

00:03:21.368 --> 00:03:22.452
(Whistle blows)

00:03:28.125 --> 00:03:29.292
(Yells)

00:03:29.501 --> 00:03:30.919
(Players cheering)

00:03:34.923 --> 00:03:35.966
(Both grunting)

00:03:36.091 --> 00:03:39.678
Nice, Johnson! You got the most
violent upper body I ever seen.

00:03:39.761 --> 00:03:42.514
Thank you, coach!
And polite as (bleep) Too.

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:44.391
Your momma
raised you right, boy.

00:03:44.474 --> 00:03:46.226
(Players cheering)

00:03:46.393 --> 00:03:49.020
Sanka? I don't chew
on sanka, son.

00:03:49.104 --> 00:03:53.233
You find me that good Italian
crap with the gondola on it. Yeah.

00:03:53.316 --> 00:03:54.756
Coach orgeron: All right,
who's next?

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:56.111
Player 1: One, two, three...

00:03:56.194 --> 00:03:57.696
Players: U! Player 2: Let's go.

00:03:57.779 --> 00:03:59.281
Man: Good job, guys.

00:03:59.364 --> 00:04:01.867
Hey. Nice practice, big fresh.

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:03.368
Yo. Thanks, Russell.

00:04:03.452 --> 00:04:06.872
Russ. Mr. All-america.
Nightmare boy.

00:04:06.955 --> 00:04:09.374
Or the conscience. That's how
I approach the game.

00:04:09.458 --> 00:04:10.751
I keep it cerebral, you know?

00:04:10.834 --> 00:04:13.211
Yeah. Totally.
Uncle Luke pulled me aside

00:04:13.295 --> 00:04:15.172
during your practice,
said he liked your game.

00:04:15.255 --> 00:04:17.174
Uncle Luke uncle Luke?
From 2 live crew?

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:18.884
From 2 live crew.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:04:19.384 --> 00:04:21.362
Want to invite you to a party
at his house tonight.

00:04:21.386 --> 00:04:23.364
He said, "I want Dwayne
Johnson to come to my party"?

00:04:23.388 --> 00:04:24.574
Or, like, how did he say...
Did he say...

00:04:24.598 --> 00:04:27.100
Hey, calm down. Calm
down. But be excited.

00:04:27.309 --> 00:04:29.120
I mean, he never invites
freshmen to his house,

00:04:29.144 --> 00:04:30.729
so, you know,
don't embarrass us.

00:04:30.812 --> 00:04:33.023
Come correct,
and dress to impress.

00:04:33.523 --> 00:04:34.816
It's not gonna be a problem.

00:04:39.488 --> 00:04:41.490
Turtleneck, Fanny pack, chain...

00:04:41.573 --> 00:04:43.909
(Inhales) Dwayne.

00:04:44.993 --> 00:04:46.244
Hey, bro. Yo.

00:04:46.328 --> 00:04:48.830
"Dear John's" about to
start. Heading out, Omar.

00:04:48.914 --> 00:04:49.956
Record it for me.

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:52.125
Noice! What's in the Fanny pack?

00:04:52.209 --> 00:04:53.627
Pop tarts and condoms.

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:56.630
Both: Eat it and beat it.
Omar: Noice.

00:04:56.713 --> 00:04:57.964
Beautiful.

00:05:01.635 --> 00:05:02.677
Hey, don't call him.

00:05:02.761 --> 00:05:05.055
Pnigonnacahhhn.
Babe, heisincohege

00:05:05.138 --> 00:05:06.264
living his life.

00:05:06.348 --> 00:05:08.725
When I was 18, I was
already on my own, wrestling.

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:10.769
But he's never been
on his own before.

00:05:10.894 --> 00:05:12.979
What if someone tries
to steal his atm pin number?

00:05:13.063 --> 00:05:14.105
He'll be fine.

00:05:14.523 --> 00:05:18.568
He's 6'5", 230 pounds with
genuine rocky Johnson blood

00:05:18.652 --> 00:05:21.196
flowing through him. Ain't nobody
gonna Rob him. (Chuckles)

00:05:21.279 --> 00:05:22.697
And instead of
worrying about Dewey,

00:05:22.906 --> 00:05:26.493
why don't we enjoy being
empty-nesters?

00:05:26.576 --> 00:05:27.911
Aren't we already doing that?

00:05:28.161 --> 00:05:31.206
Look, this is an
entertainment coupon book.

00:05:31.331 --> 00:05:33.458
It's like the Bible,
but for happiness.

00:05:34.251 --> 00:05:37.212
Video king, rent one
get one free.

00:05:40.465 --> 00:05:43.385
Fifty percent off
Rene's dolphin palace.

00:05:43.802 --> 00:05:46.429
Babe, we could be swimming
with dolphins tomorrow!

00:05:46.721 --> 00:05:48.682
I've always wanted
to swim with dolphins.

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:52.394
Uh-oh. Oh, no, not tomorrow.
Some blackout dates.

00:05:52.477 --> 00:05:54.521
But, yes, soon!

00:05:57.524 --> 00:05:59.276
(Funky music playing)

00:06:02.195 --> 00:06:04.739
Man: (Singing) Now I wrote
this record for when I perform

00:06:04.823 --> 00:06:07.117
lonely nights inside
a university dorm

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:09.578
I put pen to paper
with a paper to pen

00:06:09.661 --> 00:06:10.888
for the times
I'm rockin' the mic

00:06:10.912 --> 00:06:12.122
in front of women and men

00:06:12.205 --> 00:06:15.041
I get raw like Eddie
rough like Freddy

00:06:15.166 --> 00:06:17.586
krueger with a luger
turnin' men into spaghetti

00:06:17.669 --> 00:06:22.299
(laughs) My man, violent
torso. Michael Irving, damn!

00:06:22.382 --> 00:06:23.967
Oh, please, please.
Call me "playmaker".

00:06:24.134 --> 00:06:26.344
Playmaker. Hey, aren't
you hot in that coat?

00:06:26.428 --> 00:06:28.513
Oh, come on, baby. You
know my ice keep me cool.

00:06:28.597 --> 00:06:30.390
(Laughs) Okay. Yo, come on.

00:06:30.473 --> 00:06:31.892
Uncle Luke wants
to say hi to you.

00:06:34.519 --> 00:06:36.605
Hey, Michael, how you
doing? Oh, my goodness.

00:06:36.688 --> 00:06:38.815
Ladies, ladies, ladies,
ladies, ladies!

00:06:39.024 --> 00:06:40.734
Yo, meet my partner
Dwayne Johnson.

00:06:40.817 --> 00:06:42.712
This kid right here, he's
gonna be a star one day.

00:06:42.736 --> 00:06:43.820
I promise you.

00:06:43.904 --> 00:06:46.615
Kid? Aren't you, like,
30? (Sniggers)

00:06:46.823 --> 00:06:49.492
I'm 18. But I make
love like I'm 30.

00:07:05.008 --> 00:07:06.593
Young Dwayne: Ladies.

00:07:07.594 --> 00:07:10.138
Was that too much? Yeah,
man. Way, way too much.

00:07:12.307 --> 00:07:13.850
Uncle Luke: Oh, hey!

00:07:14.267 --> 00:07:15.810
Dwayne Johnson.

00:07:15.894 --> 00:07:19.689
This is the freshman turning all
them heads at campus. (Laughs)

00:07:19.981 --> 00:07:22.692
Yo, uncle Luke, I'm a huge fan.

00:07:22.859 --> 00:07:25.278
I played your tapes so much,
I broke three walkmans.

00:07:25.403 --> 00:07:29.157
Oh, damn, the key is not to
use the auto-reverse feature.

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:30.784
You got to hand-flip
them tapes, man.

00:07:30.867 --> 00:07:33.620
Ain't no walkman in the world
that can handle my bass.

00:07:33.828 --> 00:07:35.914
Right, my bad.
Hey, you know what, man?

00:07:35.997 --> 00:07:38.249
We got big expectations
for you, young blood.

00:07:38.333 --> 00:07:40.543
I got big expectations
for myself.

00:07:40.877 --> 00:07:42.128
I'm gonna move the crowd.

00:07:42.337 --> 00:07:44.214
See, that's what I like to hear.

00:07:44.297 --> 00:07:46.883
You got to bet on yourself.

00:07:46.967 --> 00:07:49.719
Ata: Honey, you shouldn't
have. You know it's a good one

00:07:49.803 --> 00:07:51.721
because of the width
in the back.

00:07:51.846 --> 00:07:53.765
Yeah, you like it?
Ata: Oh, we love it.

00:07:53.848 --> 00:07:56.601
But it's too much.
How can you afford this?

00:07:56.685 --> 00:07:59.104
I put it on layaway,
you know? I bet on myself.

00:07:59.187 --> 00:08:01.523
Throw this old small
bitch TV in the trash.

00:08:01.606 --> 00:08:03.292
Young Dwayne: Hey. And that TV
is just the beginning.

00:08:03.316 --> 00:08:06.277
In a couple years, it's gonna be a
three-bedroom ranch house in that box.

00:08:06.569 --> 00:08:08.571
Kenny: A lot ofyoung athletes
can relate to trying

00:08:08.655 --> 00:08:09.864
to take care of their family.

00:08:09.948 --> 00:08:11.092
Adult Dwayne:
It was my goal, Kenny.

00:08:11.116 --> 00:08:13.201
And I was on my way
to making it a reality.

00:08:13.284 --> 00:08:14.911
All right, circle up, guys!

00:08:16.371 --> 00:08:20.709
Men, this Saturday is
our season opener against by...

00:08:20.792 --> 00:08:24.462
Those Utah boys like to throw
those pretty passes,

00:08:24.546 --> 00:08:27.966
play that finesse game.
And what do we like to do?

00:08:28.049 --> 00:08:30.689
Players: Hit 'em in the mouth!
Coach orgeron: Yeah! Oklahoma drill.

00:08:30.719 --> 00:08:33.430
Cristobal, Johnson, rematch.

00:08:33.596 --> 00:08:35.516
(Whistle blows) (Players
cheering and applauding)

00:08:39.769 --> 00:08:41.354
Lightning's not gonna
strike twice.

00:08:41.438 --> 00:08:43.231
We've all seen
how this movie ends.

00:08:46.693 --> 00:08:49.612
Ready, set, hike.

00:08:57.829 --> 00:08:58.913
(Players exclaiming)

00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:05.086
I just swallowed
my damn grounds.

00:09:08.882 --> 00:09:10.842
All the ligaments
in your shoulder are torn.

00:09:11.217 --> 00:09:13.553
I'm sorry, Dwayne.
You're out for the season.

00:09:13.636 --> 00:09:15.722
Wait, what? No, that can't be...

00:09:15.805 --> 00:09:17.098
Look, this is bad.

00:09:17.348 --> 00:09:19.851
But at least it happened
before the season started.

00:09:19.934 --> 00:09:22.896
All right, we'll redshirt you so
you won't lose a year of eligibility.

00:09:23.104 --> 00:09:26.274
You rehab your butt off,
you come to team meetings,

00:09:26.357 --> 00:09:27.776
and continue to study the game,

00:09:27.901 --> 00:09:31.279
nextseason, you'll
come back even stronger.

00:09:31.362 --> 00:09:32.697
That must have been devastating.

00:09:32.864 --> 00:09:33.865
It was.

00:09:34.157 --> 00:09:36.010
But, you know, injuries
are just part of the game.

00:09:36.034 --> 00:09:38.161
And I really believed
in what coach 0 was saying.

00:09:38.244 --> 00:09:40.705
There was no reason why I
couldn't hit rehab really hard

00:09:40.789 --> 00:09:42.499
and then come back
even stronger.

00:09:42.582 --> 00:09:43.726
I don't care
what the coach says.

00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:45.102
You're injured.
You should come home.

00:09:45.126 --> 00:09:47.253
Mom, they reset
my shoulder. I'm fine.

00:09:47.337 --> 00:09:49.047
Babe, injuries are
part of the game.

00:09:49.297 --> 00:09:50.673
Remember when I broke three ribs

00:09:50.757 --> 00:09:52.008
against big John studd,

00:09:52.092 --> 00:09:53.652
then after the match,
andré kept tickling me?

00:09:53.676 --> 00:09:55.386
I knew something bad
was going to happen.

00:09:55.470 --> 00:09:58.098
I had that mother's intuition.
But you started distracting me

00:09:58.181 --> 00:10:00.034
with dolphin coupons,
and, boom, Dewey gets hurt.

00:10:00.058 --> 00:10:01.601
I'm gonna dominate rehab

00:10:01.684 --> 00:10:03.394
and come back
stronger than ever, mom.

00:10:03.478 --> 00:10:05.522
Tough as nails,
just like your old man.

00:10:05.605 --> 00:10:06.856
I got some hernia x-rays

00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:08.125
that will bring a tear
to your eye, son.

00:10:08.149 --> 00:10:10.443
Rocky, no one wants to hear
about your hernia right now.

00:10:10.652 --> 00:10:13.530
You say that, butwhen they hear
the story, they're always riveted.

00:10:13.613 --> 00:10:15.532
Dewey, are you sure you're okay?

00:10:15.865 --> 00:10:17.992
Mom, trust me. I'm fine.

00:10:18.159 --> 00:10:19.244
And were you okay?

00:10:21.079 --> 00:10:23.665
Commentator: And after
dropping their opener to byu,

00:10:23.748 --> 00:10:25.708
the 'canes look to pick up a win

00:10:25.792 --> 00:10:28.253
in their first home game
of the season.

00:10:30.922 --> 00:10:32.882
Hey, brother. Hey, Mario.

00:10:33.133 --> 00:10:34.318
Sorry you got hurt in that play,

00:10:34.342 --> 00:10:36.469
but I want you to know
I got your back.

00:10:36.553 --> 00:10:38.572
Can't wait for you to get healthy.
We'll make each other great.

00:10:38.596 --> 00:10:40.476
Don't worry about it.
No hard feelings, brother.

00:10:40.557 --> 00:10:43.351
Today I play for you.

00:10:45.395 --> 00:10:46.396
Who's Vicki?

00:10:46.479 --> 00:10:48.479
My mom's best friend who's
going through a divorce.

00:10:48.606 --> 00:10:51.818
Won't people think you're
honoring a girl named Vicki Johnson?

00:10:54.737 --> 00:10:57.031
Well, you'll know
it's half for you.

00:10:57.198 --> 00:10:58.741
All right, boys, gather up.

00:10:58.867 --> 00:10:59.951
(Players grunting)

00:11:02.287 --> 00:11:04.181
We're gonna go out there today,
and we're gonna do three things.

00:11:04.205 --> 00:11:05.206
Players: What's that?

00:11:05.331 --> 00:11:08.668
We gonna hit, stick,
and bust (bleep). What else?

00:11:08.751 --> 00:11:10.211
Players: Talk (bleep)!
What else?

00:11:10.295 --> 00:11:11.629
Talk (bleep)! What else?

00:11:11.713 --> 00:11:13.548
Talk (bleep) Let's go!

00:11:16.467 --> 00:11:18.803
Kenny: Man, you never
want to be the guy in jeans.

00:11:20.263 --> 00:11:21.663
Adult Dwayne:
Oh, it was bad, Kenny.

00:11:22.182 --> 00:11:25.393
And the jeans, they were wide.

00:11:25.476 --> 00:11:28.062
It was the first big injury
I had experienced.

00:11:28.146 --> 00:11:29.898
So I did what I knew how to do.

00:11:31.024 --> 00:11:32.942
I hit rehab hard.

00:11:33.026 --> 00:11:34.903
The gym was always my sanctuary.

00:11:34.986 --> 00:11:36.463
Outside of getting
my shoulder healthy,

00:11:36.487 --> 00:11:38.281
I didn't care about
anything else.

00:11:38.489 --> 00:11:39.949
I just couldn't
get myself motivated

00:11:40.033 --> 00:11:42.202
to prepare for games
that I wouldn't play in.

00:11:42.493 --> 00:11:44.579
So I started blowing off
team meetings,

00:11:44.662 --> 00:11:46.497
started blowing off class.

00:11:46.581 --> 00:11:48.374
My shoulder might have been
getting stronger,

00:11:48.458 --> 00:11:49.542
but my mind wasn't.

00:11:49.626 --> 00:11:50.668
(Scoffs)

00:11:50.752 --> 00:11:53.588
Mr. Johnson, something
to add to our conversation?

00:11:53.796 --> 00:11:56.716
Yeah. I pressed b, but it
didn'tjump. (Students laughing)

00:11:57.592 --> 00:11:58.801
Adult Dwayne: I was spiraling.

00:11:58.927 --> 00:12:00.207
Omar: Yo,
you still playing sega?

00:12:00.678 --> 00:12:01.864
Don't you have a final tomorrow?

00:12:01.888 --> 00:12:04.474
Yeah, at 6:00 am,
worth 80% of my grade.

00:12:04.807 --> 00:12:07.477
Seems like a lot of percent.
Shouldn't you study a little?

00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:10.271
I tried, but I just don't care.

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:13.316
All right. Obviously,
you're in a bad place.

00:12:13.483 --> 00:12:15.985
But staying in this room
all day isn't helping.

00:12:16.152 --> 00:12:17.445
We got to
get your head straight.

00:12:17.528 --> 00:12:20.156
Yeah. Turn off the sega.

00:12:20.490 --> 00:12:22.408
Let's me and you
go grab some drinks

00:12:22.492 --> 00:12:24.535
and get into a fight.

00:12:24.869 --> 00:12:28.373
I can't wait for you
to pretend to hold me back.

00:12:30.208 --> 00:12:32.752
Yo, this is perfect.
Knock back some tequilas.

00:12:32.835 --> 00:12:34.003
Throw some fists.

00:12:34.087 --> 00:12:36.256
Yo, keep a lookout
for some contenders.

00:12:36.339 --> 00:12:38.758
Violent torso.
Yo, the conscience.

00:12:39.050 --> 00:12:41.610
Where you been at, man? I ain't
seen you at none of the meetings.

00:12:41.719 --> 00:12:44.138
Uh, you know, I've been around.

00:12:44.264 --> 00:12:45.348
Oh, okay.

00:12:45.431 --> 00:12:47.350
Well, what you standing
on line for, man?

00:12:47.433 --> 00:12:49.686
'Canes don't wait in line.
Come on inside, baby.

00:12:53.106 --> 00:12:55.817
Yo, why is he getting in?
He's not on the team.

00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:57.110
What'd you say?

00:12:57.193 --> 00:12:58.653
I said you're not on the team.

00:12:58.736 --> 00:13:00.816
I've seen every game, and
I have never seen you play.

00:13:00.863 --> 00:13:03.157
Oh, is that right?
What do you think, Omar?

00:13:03.241 --> 00:13:05.243
Should I show this guy
I'm on the team?

00:13:05.868 --> 00:13:07.745
No fighting here.
If you want to throw,

00:13:07.829 --> 00:13:08.871
take it to drunk alley.

00:13:09.038 --> 00:13:10.123
(Grunting)

00:13:13.459 --> 00:13:15.712
Hell yeah. Drunk alley.

00:13:15.795 --> 00:13:17.046
Let's go.

00:13:17.130 --> 00:13:18.274
I don't think
you want to do that.

00:13:18.298 --> 00:13:19.966
You heard what
he said to me, Omar.

00:13:20.049 --> 00:13:21.384
This is why we're here, man.

00:13:21.467 --> 00:13:23.261
I've seen this guy
at myjudo tournaments.

00:13:23.344 --> 00:13:24.637
He's past a black belt.

00:13:24.721 --> 00:13:26.681
His belt goes up so high,
they ran out of colors.

00:13:31.561 --> 00:13:32.979
You know what?

00:13:33.062 --> 00:13:34.856
I'm not even sure I
know what he said to me.

00:13:35.148 --> 00:13:37.233
Probably misheard.
Couldn't have been that bad.

00:13:39.402 --> 00:13:41.863
Sorry. We're at capacity. What?

00:13:41.946 --> 00:13:43.173
You were just
about to let us in.

00:13:43.197 --> 00:13:44.490
I was here with my teammates.

00:13:44.741 --> 00:13:46.075
Hey, uncle Luke.

00:13:46.159 --> 00:13:50.413
Oh, hey. Dan? Dwayne.

00:13:50.663 --> 00:13:52.790
That's right. That's right.
That's right.

00:13:52.874 --> 00:13:54.917
Hey, I heard you
messed up your ankle.

00:13:55.001 --> 00:13:57.253
My shoulder. I'm
redshirting this year.

00:13:57.795 --> 00:13:59.297
Yeah, I heard
this place is hiring.

00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:02.383
Maybe you can do security
for bongos. (Laughs)

00:14:03.092 --> 00:14:04.510
I'll see you later, my man.

00:14:06.220 --> 00:14:08.848
Dude, where are you
going? Far from here.

00:14:08.973 --> 00:14:10.516
What about your final?

00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:11.642
(Lock clattering)

00:14:12.352 --> 00:14:14.771
Miss Carla, your drunk ass
at the wrong door again!

00:14:14.854 --> 00:14:17.440
Go home, miss Carla!
You're at 3b!

00:14:17.690 --> 00:14:19.067
Dewey! Hey!

00:14:19.192 --> 00:14:22.028
Surprise! What are you doing
here? Is something wrong?

00:14:22.111 --> 00:14:23.696
Your Christmas break
isn't for a week.

00:14:23.863 --> 00:14:25.782
Oh, I'm fine.
Everything's great.

00:14:25.865 --> 00:14:27.950
I finished finals early,
so I took the bus.

00:14:28.034 --> 00:14:29.118
The bus? Did you... yes.

00:14:29.202 --> 00:14:30.453
I stayed awake the whole time

00:14:30.536 --> 00:14:32.205
so nobody could put anything
in my mouth.

00:14:32.372 --> 00:14:35.375
Are you hungry? Want me to make
your favorite, steak and teriyaki wings?

00:14:35.458 --> 00:14:38.378
Ma, it's almost midnight. Yes.

00:14:38.461 --> 00:14:39.504
(Giggles)

00:14:40.463 --> 00:14:41.506
Come here, boy.

00:14:41.589 --> 00:14:44.759
Hey, tv100ksgood. Doesnth?

00:14:44.967 --> 00:14:47.428
We were looking forward to
watching you on it this season.

00:14:47.512 --> 00:14:49.138
But hey, next year, right?

00:14:49.389 --> 00:14:51.391
Yeah, right.
Did your momma tell you

00:14:51.474 --> 00:14:53.851
how many horizontal lines
this thing got?

00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:55.978
(Voice fading) Boy,
it's all about the amount

00:14:56.062 --> 00:14:58.314
of horizontal lines, son.

00:14:59.941 --> 00:15:02.902
Commentator: Third down.
Third and six...

00:15:03.152 --> 00:15:04.987
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
Oh, you're kidding me.

00:15:05.071 --> 00:15:06.072
That's pi.

00:15:06.322 --> 00:15:07.407
Breakfast wings.

00:15:07.490 --> 00:15:09.409
Oh, you're the best, mom.
Thank you.

00:15:09.742 --> 00:15:10.993
So tell me about finals.

00:15:11.077 --> 00:15:14.122
Which one was the hardest?
Yeah, they were all hard.

00:15:14.455 --> 00:15:16.916
Sorry. I'm just trying
to watch the game.

00:15:17.291 --> 00:15:19.585
Oh, sure. We'll talk later.

00:15:19.669 --> 00:15:21.796
Mmm-hmm.

00:15:22.630 --> 00:15:23.982
Adult Dwayne: I was happy
to be home.

00:15:24.006 --> 00:15:26.300
Away from all
the disappointments at Miami.

00:15:30.012 --> 00:15:33.349
But that happiness didn't last.

00:15:34.016 --> 00:15:35.893
I got the blues

00:15:35.977 --> 00:15:37.979
but I don't mind

00:15:38.354 --> 00:15:40.189
all I have to do

00:15:40.273 --> 00:15:42.066
ls get to you
and then I feel just fine

00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:43.192
(chuckles)

00:15:44.193 --> 00:15:46.279
You're so good

00:15:47.738 --> 00:15:49.449
the way you give

00:15:49.907 --> 00:15:51.784
you so good

00:15:52.869 --> 00:15:55.413
you're the best there is

00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:57.975
commentator: Now by the
time the ball is thrown, notre dame...

00:15:57.999 --> 00:15:59.959
Here, this is for yourjuice.

00:16:03.004 --> 00:16:05.548
Hey, it's a nice day outside.
We could go see that gator,

00:16:05.631 --> 00:16:07.693
see if they got a hold of
anymore fast-food containers.

00:16:07.717 --> 00:16:10.511
(Sighs) I'm kinda tired. I think
I'm just gonna watch the game.

00:16:14.515 --> 00:16:16.726
Adult Dwayne: Nowadays
they'd call it depression.

00:16:19.270 --> 00:16:21.189
Woman on TV:
The sofa bed and the vacuum.

00:16:21.272 --> 00:16:22.416
Adult Dwayne: But, back then,

00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:23.858
the accepted medical term was...

00:16:23.941 --> 00:16:26.527
Hey. Snap out of it! What?

00:16:26.736 --> 00:16:28.613
You've been sitting
on this couch for days.

00:16:28.696 --> 00:16:31.574
Go out, get some air.

00:16:31.741 --> 00:16:33.910
Ah! You didn't even look
through the booklet.

00:16:33.993 --> 00:16:35.953
Dad, I don't want to swim
with any dolphins.

00:16:36.537 --> 00:16:38.831
You don't know what
you're saying right now.

00:16:38.915 --> 00:16:41.667
When I come back, I want you
to pick out three fun things

00:16:41.751 --> 00:16:43.336
you want to do.

00:16:45.505 --> 00:16:48.174
I talked to him. He's fine now.

00:16:48.257 --> 00:16:51.010
He's not fine.
Something's wrong.

00:16:51.093 --> 00:16:53.179
Well, maybe his
shoulder's hurting

00:16:53.304 --> 00:16:54.544
or he's burned out from finals.

00:16:54.597 --> 00:16:56.974
Rocky, I am telling you,
something's off.

00:16:57.099 --> 00:16:59.435
He's not himself.
He won't even talk to me.

00:16:59.519 --> 00:17:00.853
He keeps saying he's just tired,

00:17:00.937 --> 00:17:02.313
but I know that's not true.

00:17:03.773 --> 00:17:05.816
Okay, what should we do?

00:17:08.694 --> 00:17:11.906
Look at us, wearing
each other's tank-tops.

00:17:12.031 --> 00:17:14.700
Hey, easy money.
You're looking good.

00:17:14.784 --> 00:17:17.119
Hey, this is my kid Dwayne
I was telling you about.

00:17:17.203 --> 00:17:18.621
Plays football for the u.

00:17:18.704 --> 00:17:21.749
Dad, stop saying that.
What? It's true.

00:17:21.832 --> 00:17:24.877
Technically, it's not. I haven't
played a single snap yet in a game.

00:17:24.961 --> 00:17:26.712
Ah, it's just a matter of time.

00:17:27.004 --> 00:17:28.714
All right. What's
going on with you?

00:17:29.423 --> 00:17:31.926
Nothing. Well, your
mom thinks it's something.

00:17:32.009 --> 00:17:34.595
And I think she's right.
She's worried about you.

00:17:35.012 --> 00:17:39.183
That's why we're at the gym.
It's a safe space. So talk.

00:17:39.267 --> 00:17:40.476
I don't want to talk.

00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:41.811
Come on, son.

00:17:41.978 --> 00:17:44.897
I know... hey, Tyree.

00:17:44.981 --> 00:17:47.316
Boy, when you gonna listen to
me and get into bodybuilding?

00:17:47.483 --> 00:17:50.528
Hey, this is my kid I was telling
you about, plays football for the...

00:17:50.611 --> 00:17:52.905
Dad, stop!

00:17:52.989 --> 00:17:54.615
I don't play football for Miami.

00:17:54.699 --> 00:17:57.827
I'm barely on the team.
I wearjeans on gameday.

00:17:57.910 --> 00:17:59.829
Jeans? What do you mean?

00:18:00.246 --> 00:18:02.790
I haven't been to team
meetings in months, and...

00:18:03.082 --> 00:18:05.876
I didn't finish school early.
I blew off finals and left.

00:18:07.545 --> 00:18:09.130
I got injured
in the last practice

00:18:09.213 --> 00:18:10.464
before the season, dad.

00:18:10.965 --> 00:18:12.885
The only freshman that was
gonna get on the field

00:18:12.925 --> 00:18:13.968
and that one play...

00:18:14.051 --> 00:18:17.430
Son, you can't dwell on that.
If you let yourself

00:18:17.513 --> 00:18:19.807
get stuck there, you're
gonna stay stuck there.

00:18:20.016 --> 00:18:22.101
I tried, but I can't
get it out of my head.

00:18:22.685 --> 00:18:24.145
Hmm.

00:18:24.228 --> 00:18:28.399
That thing, that voice
in your head, that's fear.

00:18:28.566 --> 00:18:30.610
It's trying to make
you doubt yourself,

00:18:30.693 --> 00:18:32.820
trying to steal yourconfidence.

00:18:32.903 --> 00:18:33.904
But you can't let it.

00:18:33.988 --> 00:18:36.616
You got to tune it out
and keep going.

00:18:37.158 --> 00:18:38.326
I don't know how.

00:18:38.409 --> 00:18:40.578
Yeah, the how is
different for everyone.

00:18:40.661 --> 00:18:42.246
I spoke my dreams out loud.

00:18:42.622 --> 00:18:45.458
That way, I could try
to live up to them.

00:18:45.541 --> 00:18:48.669
People can say a lot
of stuff about me, son.

00:18:48.753 --> 00:18:53.466
But the one thing they can
never say is that I gave up.

00:18:53.549 --> 00:18:55.176
I always kept fighting.

00:18:55.676 --> 00:18:57.678
So, is this the life
you dreamed of,

00:18:57.887 --> 00:19:00.765
sitting on your parents' couch
watching TV all day?

00:19:00.848 --> 00:19:04.602
Because if it is,
hey, you did it.

00:19:04.810 --> 00:19:07.188
I'll get you some shifts
driving trucks,

00:19:07.271 --> 00:19:08.689
and then the fight can be over.

00:19:09.231 --> 00:19:10.399
Is that what you want?

00:19:12.026 --> 00:19:14.904
Or do you want to keep fighting?

00:19:17.198 --> 00:19:18.491
I want to keep fighting.

00:19:22.119 --> 00:19:23.430
Kenny: Wow.
I'm surprised your dad

00:19:23.454 --> 00:19:26.332
was so ahead of his time
as far as mental health goes.

00:19:26.499 --> 00:19:28.542
Adult dwayn e: Yeah,
it surprised me too.

00:19:28.626 --> 00:19:32.630
And my dad was just letting
me know that I wasn't alone.

00:19:32.713 --> 00:19:34.399
And that's what I want to
share with your audience, Kenny,

00:19:34.423 --> 00:19:36.509
is that you're not alone.

00:19:36.634 --> 00:19:38.236
If you're going through it
and you're struggling

00:19:38.260 --> 00:19:39.446
and you're depressed,
you're not alone.

00:19:39.470 --> 00:19:41.055
And it's okay to ask for help.

00:19:41.222 --> 00:19:42.662
And asking for help
isn't a weakness.

00:19:42.723 --> 00:19:45.559
Asking for help
is actually our superpower.

00:19:45.643 --> 00:19:47.561
Amen to that, brother. Preach.

00:19:47.770 --> 00:19:49.081
Kenny: Now, I played
for a lot of coaches.

00:19:49.105 --> 00:19:52.024
Did your coaches have rocky's
understanding and compassion?

00:19:52.108 --> 00:19:54.193
Like I said, it was
a different time back then.

00:19:54.276 --> 00:19:56.987
You blew off your classes
and your finals,

00:19:57.071 --> 00:19:59.490
and you got a
point-freaking-7 gpa.

00:19:59.615 --> 00:20:01.575
The dolphin
they enrolled in classes

00:20:01.659 --> 00:20:04.870
as a publicity stunt got a 0.9.

00:20:05.162 --> 00:20:07.748
I'm sorry I let you
and the team down, coach.

00:20:07.873 --> 00:20:09.476
But I'm gonna fight
to earn back your trust.

00:20:09.500 --> 00:20:11.085
Just get your ass back in shape,

00:20:11.168 --> 00:20:12.753
show me that upper-body violence

00:20:12.837 --> 00:20:15.047
and you hit some
sum' bitches in the mouth.

00:20:15.423 --> 00:20:16.590
(Grunts)

00:20:17.425 --> 00:20:19.927
I need to stop chewing coffee.

00:20:20.010 --> 00:20:23.180
Adult Dwayne: [Wasn't going
to let coach o down or my family.

00:20:23.264 --> 00:20:24.974
I was ready to fight
for my spot back.

00:20:25.057 --> 00:20:26.976
Come on. Let's go. Go where?

00:20:27.268 --> 00:20:31.439
I made us reservations
at Rene's dolphin palace.

00:20:31.772 --> 00:20:33.441
Let's have a swim. For real?

00:20:33.524 --> 00:20:34.692
(Both giggling)

00:20:38.738 --> 00:20:40.239
Thank you for helping our son.

00:20:43.325 --> 00:20:44.535
Oh, bring your camera.

00:20:44.618 --> 00:20:46.787
I want to have a dolphin
jump over me while I look up.

00:20:46.871 --> 00:20:47.872
(Giggling)

00:20:49.331 --> 00:20:50.517
Kenny: Thanks
for joining us, man.

00:20:50.541 --> 00:20:51.981
I appreciate you
coming here, Dwayne.

00:20:52.126 --> 00:20:55.087
Before I let you go, we got
a special surprise for you.

00:20:55.171 --> 00:20:56.797
What's up, man? I can't hear.

00:20:56.922 --> 00:20:58.191
Yeah, tell him I can't hear him.

00:20:58.215 --> 00:20:59.717
What do you say, man?
It's coach 0.

00:20:59.967 --> 00:21:01.010
How's your pad level?

00:21:01.093 --> 00:21:02.553
Low. Low. Low man wins.

00:21:02.636 --> 00:21:04.555
Low man wins. (Laughs)

00:21:04.972 --> 00:21:06.265
We've all had a learning curve

00:21:06.348 --> 00:21:07.558
when it comes to head stuff.

00:21:07.641 --> 00:21:09.268
But I've always respected
how you fought

00:21:09.351 --> 00:21:11.604
through hard times, Dewey.
You didn't quit.

00:21:11.729 --> 00:21:14.523
Me and you've been down,
but we've never been out.

00:21:14.607 --> 00:21:17.401
(Sighs) That's so true, coach.
I want to say thank you.

00:21:17.485 --> 00:21:19.111
And I love you.
Thank you, coach.

00:21:19.487 --> 00:21:21.697
Very proud of you.
And I love you too, son.

00:21:23.032 --> 00:21:24.492
Go, tigers!

00:21:24.575 --> 00:21:26.285
Wow. That was coach 0,
everybody.

00:21:26.368 --> 00:21:27.828
All right, man.
