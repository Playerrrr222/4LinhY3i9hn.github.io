WEBVTT

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:06.924
(News music playing)

00:00:07.299 --> 00:00:08.443
Thank you
for joining us tonight.

00:00:08.467 --> 00:00:09.676
I'm Randall park.

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:12.179
With the presidential race
kicking into high gear,

00:00:12.262 --> 00:00:14.431
the candidates are all
asking the same question,

00:00:14.515 --> 00:00:17.643
what issue is most important
to the American voters.

00:00:17.893 --> 00:00:19.728
Our cameras were allowed
exclusive access

00:00:19.811 --> 00:00:21.772
to a strategy meeting
with candidate Johnson.

00:00:21.855 --> 00:00:23.065
And his campaign manager.

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:24.399
As you can see from the data,

00:00:24.483 --> 00:00:26.109
our campaign polled
likely voters

00:00:26.193 --> 00:00:28.379
about their biggest concerns,
which we'll want to address

00:00:28.403 --> 00:00:29.571
when we shoot our TV ad,

00:00:29.696 --> 00:00:30.906
and the most common answer was

00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:32.366
oh, you know what'd be good?

00:00:32.491 --> 00:00:34.284
I'd like to guess
family feud ster.

00:00:34.618 --> 00:00:36.620
That's fun, okay.

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.706
What is the biggest concern
among American voters?

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:42.042
Job security.
(Gasps) Ding, ding, ding!

00:00:42.125 --> 00:00:43.377
Number one answer.

00:00:43.544 --> 00:00:46.004
So, what our polling showed
is, with automation on the rise,

00:00:46.088 --> 00:00:48.257
people worry about technology
replacing them

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:50.175
in the workforce.
Yeah, that makes sense.

00:00:50.384 --> 00:00:51.468
I mean, a change like that

00:00:51.552 --> 00:00:53.095
creates a lot of
uncertainty in people.

00:00:53.178 --> 00:00:54.263
And trust me, I know.

00:00:54.346 --> 00:00:55.448
My life has changed
so much over the years.

00:00:55.472 --> 00:00:57.182
Right, you were
the scorpion king,

00:00:57.266 --> 00:00:58.952
and now you may be the leader
of the free world.

00:00:58.976 --> 00:01:00.811
I was actually talking about
when I was a kid.

00:01:00.936 --> 00:01:02.938
Me too. That's also
what I meant. Mmm-hmm.

00:01:03.146 --> 00:01:04.773
My mom and I followed my dad

00:01:04.856 --> 00:01:06.358
as he wrestled
all over the world,

00:01:06.858 --> 00:01:08.402
and things were
challenging back then.

00:01:08.527 --> 00:01:09.847
Like, living paycheck
to paycheck.

00:01:09.903 --> 00:01:11.530
I mean, we weren't destitute
in any way,

00:01:11.613 --> 00:01:12.906
but we certainly weren't rich.

00:01:13.282 --> 00:01:14.491
I gotta tell you when my dad

00:01:14.575 --> 00:01:16.285
first started wrestling
for the wwf,

00:01:16.368 --> 00:01:18.248
it felt as though
things changed just like that.

00:01:18.412 --> 00:01:19.997
(Bell rings) This is crazy!

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:22.332
You're wrestling
the black demon in New York,

00:01:22.499 --> 00:01:23.875
and you're here
at the same time.

00:01:23.959 --> 00:01:26.003
That's called syndication,
little man.

00:01:26.253 --> 00:01:27.629
I'm nationwide, baby.

00:01:27.921 --> 00:01:29.399
I can't believe
they're airing wrestling

00:01:29.423 --> 00:01:30.983
coast-to-coast
like it's the jeffersons.

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.801
Announcer on TV:
Takes commanding control.

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:34.595
(Crowd cheering) Nice move, dad.

00:01:35.137 --> 00:01:36.346
The crowd is going crazy!

00:01:36.597 --> 00:01:38.682
Oh, they are. They are.

00:01:38.974 --> 00:01:40.475
Oh, look, look,
there's Vince McMahon.

00:01:40.726 --> 00:01:42.269
Certainly an impressive victory

00:01:42.352 --> 00:01:44.021
by "the soul man" rocky Johnson.

00:01:44.354 --> 00:01:45.456
Together, me and him
are gonna do

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:47.566
some exciting things
for the wwf.

00:01:48.025 --> 00:01:49.505
The camera loves
a strong chin dimple.

00:01:49.901 --> 00:01:51.653
Hey, thanks to him,
a million fans

00:01:51.862 --> 00:01:53.989
just saw me
beat black demon's ass,

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.117
so I thought we'd capitalize
on that... (Grunts)

00:01:57.367 --> 00:02:00.287
And start selling merch
at my events.

00:02:00.704 --> 00:02:05.167
We gotjackets, hats,
t-shirts, scissors.

00:02:05.292 --> 00:02:06.686
Do not throw him
scissors. Scissors?

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:09.838
Uh, to cut the sleeves
off the shirts, son.

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:11.381
Free the great black sharks.

00:02:11.923 --> 00:02:14.051
Can I help sell merch?
Absolutely.

00:02:14.926 --> 00:02:15.927
You know what?

00:02:16.011 --> 00:02:19.264
You could be president
of the rocky Johnson fan club.

00:02:19.431 --> 00:02:20.515
Congratulations.

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:21.933
(Laughs) Whoa!

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:23.852
(Both grunting)

00:02:24.603 --> 00:02:25.812
How much did all this cost?

00:02:26.021 --> 00:02:27.301
Oh, don't worry
about that, babe.

00:02:27.356 --> 00:02:28.357
You heard that crowd.

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.400
I'm on track to being
Vince's number one guy.

00:02:30.525 --> 00:02:32.285
Is that why we're staying
in this nice motel?

00:02:32.527 --> 00:02:34.446
Oh, son, this is a hotel.

00:02:34.655 --> 00:02:36.215
That's why we let you
sit on the carpet.

00:02:36.281 --> 00:02:37.991
Huh. (Knocking at door)

00:02:38.116 --> 00:02:39.493
Oh, I wonder who that could be.

00:02:40.327 --> 00:02:43.872
Did someone order...
Room service?

00:02:44.247 --> 00:02:45.499
Young Dwayne: Whoa.

00:02:46.166 --> 00:02:49.378
(Singing) When the food comes
to you all the way in your room

00:02:49.461 --> 00:02:50.837
that's room service

00:02:50.921 --> 00:02:51.922
(laughs)

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:56.134
We will eat it all
and the sauces are small

00:02:56.218 --> 00:02:57.761
it's room service

00:02:58.178 --> 00:02:59.805
that's my new favorite song.

00:02:59.888 --> 00:03:00.948
(Give it to me baby playing)

00:03:00.972 --> 00:03:03.016
Give it to me, baby
give it to me, baby

00:03:08.355 --> 00:03:09.356
Here you go.

00:03:09.606 --> 00:03:12.651
Marisa, my pen has run out.
Can I borrow yours?

00:03:13.151 --> 00:03:14.569
Sorry, Lia,
I've only got the one.

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:22.411
I can just remember stuff.
Yeah, thank you, dear.

00:03:23.203 --> 00:03:25.414
And entering the diner,

00:03:25.497 --> 00:03:28.125
standing at 6'2", 260 pounds.

00:03:28.375 --> 00:03:30.085
You've seen him on national TV.

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:33.505
Soulman rocky Johnson!

00:03:33.588 --> 00:03:35.948
(Crowd cheering and applauding)
Rocky: Thank you, thank you.

00:03:37.259 --> 00:03:38.260
Appreciate it.

00:03:38.677 --> 00:03:40.804
Hi, grandma. Sorry
we're late. Hey, Lia.

00:03:41.096 --> 00:03:42.556
Hey, mom.
Rocky: Mmm, looks good.

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:43.640
I'm starving.

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:45.600
I should kiss Vince McMahon
on the mouth.

00:03:45.684 --> 00:03:46.893
Mom. What?

00:03:46.977 --> 00:03:48.353
You heard that reaction.

00:03:48.437 --> 00:03:50.564
Wwf get more popular,

00:03:50.689 --> 00:03:52.649
our company
gets more popular too.

00:03:52.941 --> 00:03:54.401
You know,
ever since Peter passed...

00:03:54.985 --> 00:03:57.487
I love you, Peter.
I love you, high chief.

00:03:58.155 --> 00:04:00.198
Vince has become
so supportive of me.

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:01.491
Vince loves you.

00:04:01.575 --> 00:04:03.511
You're the only promoter
he lets his wrestlers work for

00:04:03.535 --> 00:04:04.745
outside the wwf.

00:04:04.953 --> 00:04:06.747
I'm his favorite
ever since I gave him

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:08.290
my recipe for pulled pork.

00:04:08.749 --> 00:04:10.000
Look at this.

00:04:13.295 --> 00:04:14.296
Young Dwayne: Whoa!

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:16.089
The poster for your
island battle royale.

00:04:16.339 --> 00:04:17.924
All my best guys will be there.

00:04:18.091 --> 00:04:19.676
Lia: Rocky. "The soulman."

00:04:20.093 --> 00:04:22.262
Lia: The iron sheik.
Iran, number one!

00:04:22.471 --> 00:04:23.680
Lia: Junkyard dog.

00:04:23.764 --> 00:04:25.932
I'm an old, nasty dog. (Growls)

00:04:26.016 --> 00:04:27.517
Nasty dog!

00:04:27.976 --> 00:04:29.895
Lia: Greg
"the hammer" Valentine.

00:04:29.978 --> 00:04:31.938
I get angry very quickly!

00:04:32.022 --> 00:04:33.356
Lia: Andre the giant.

00:04:33.482 --> 00:04:34.566
I don't even exercise.

00:04:34.691 --> 00:04:36.234
Lia: "Macho man" Randy savage.

00:04:36.318 --> 00:04:39.196
Tower of power
too sweet to be soured.

00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:40.530
Lia: King Kong Bundy.

00:04:40.655 --> 00:04:42.032
Give me a five count!

00:04:42.115 --> 00:04:44.534
Oh, no, actually
king Kong Bundy has pulled out

00:04:44.618 --> 00:04:45.952
because his mom's sick.

00:04:46.036 --> 00:04:48.121
Oh, right. I forgot.

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:49.456
My mom is sick.

00:04:49.664 --> 00:04:52.876
We'll miss him, but nothing
is more important than family.

00:04:52.959 --> 00:04:53.960
Mmm.

00:04:54.586 --> 00:04:57.255
You coming over to look
at your father's boxes?

00:04:57.339 --> 00:04:58.715
You know,
it's been three months.

00:04:58.882 --> 00:05:00.634
Yeah, it's time.

00:05:00.759 --> 00:05:03.762
Good, you can decide
what goes and what stays.

00:05:04.888 --> 00:05:06.264
I know. Oh, and remind me

00:05:06.348 --> 00:05:08.683
to give this poster
to my assistant, Bob,

00:05:08.767 --> 00:05:09.768
so he can put it up.

00:05:10.018 --> 00:05:11.561
Is that him sitting out there?

00:05:13.814 --> 00:05:15.190
Why didn't Bob come in?

00:05:15.315 --> 00:05:16.775
It's a family breakfast.

00:05:21.905 --> 00:05:23.132
Adult Dwayne:
My grandmother and my dad

00:05:23.156 --> 00:05:25.075
could feel the world
of wrestling changing...

00:05:25.158 --> 00:05:26.535
Is that rocky Johnson?

00:05:26.952 --> 00:05:28.495
And their futures looked bright.

00:05:28.578 --> 00:05:30.789
Hey, Dewey, check it out.

00:05:31.081 --> 00:05:33.959
Whoa, why'd they put you
in between two ladies?

00:05:34.543 --> 00:05:37.921
That's Sylvester Stallone.
He's rocky number two.

00:05:38.296 --> 00:05:40.048
Rocky, great match last night.

00:05:40.131 --> 00:05:42.300
Thanks, jt. We all set
for the autograph signing

00:05:42.384 --> 00:05:43.552
on Saturday? All set.

00:05:43.635 --> 00:05:46.137
My dad is gonna need
all fan photos

00:05:46.221 --> 00:05:48.515
taken on his right side.
That's his good side.

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:49.850
Oh, and he's gonna need

00:05:49.933 --> 00:05:52.269
five silver pens
and ten ripe mangos,

00:05:52.435 --> 00:05:53.770
pre-sliced, for energy.

00:05:53.979 --> 00:05:55.021
Okay.

00:05:57.732 --> 00:06:00.026
Yeah, sure. I'll take that.

00:06:01.236 --> 00:06:04.990
Oh, yeah, great definition
in the thighs, brother, yeah.

00:06:05.115 --> 00:06:06.950
Look at the detail in the hair.

00:06:07.033 --> 00:06:09.202
Wow, what's that?

00:06:09.411 --> 00:06:10.412
My action figure.

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:11.955
Vince McMahon sent it to me.

00:06:12.038 --> 00:06:14.749
Vince didn't tell me he was
making us into action figures.

00:06:14.916 --> 00:06:16.751
Not us, only me.

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:19.963
Adult Dwayne: But things
were even brighter for Andre.

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:21.172
It's a prototype.

00:06:21.256 --> 00:06:23.300
One night, Vince and I,
we were drinking fernet,

00:06:23.425 --> 00:06:26.469
and he say, "I wonder how
small we can make Andre."

00:06:26.553 --> 00:06:29.931
And I say, "not small at all.
Andre is a giant, huh?"

00:06:30.724 --> 00:06:32.893
And today he sent me this.

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:34.352
Regarde.

00:06:34.603 --> 00:06:35.937
(Laughing)

00:06:36.146 --> 00:06:37.981
Oh, the arms moving.
Young Dwayne: Damn!

00:06:38.189 --> 00:06:39.399
Dad, you getting one of those?

00:06:39.482 --> 00:06:41.359
Yeah, I'm sure mine is coming.

00:06:41.526 --> 00:06:42.652
Not coming soon, boss.

00:06:43.445 --> 00:06:45.525
Yeah, Andre, we know you're
Vince's number one guy...

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:47.991
Well, I mean, I don't think
we all know that.

00:06:48.074 --> 00:06:50.314
So, did you guys talk about
me when you was out drinking?

00:06:50.619 --> 00:06:51.953
'Cause I love fernet.

00:06:52.037 --> 00:06:53.371
We go out, I'm like,

00:06:53.455 --> 00:06:55.415
"somebody get a round
of fernet for the dog."

00:06:58.293 --> 00:07:00.545
It's correct down there?

00:07:01.338 --> 00:07:02.923
Hey, come on. (Speaking French)

00:07:03.006 --> 00:07:04.766
What are you doing, man?
It's a toy for kids.

00:07:05.133 --> 00:07:07.177
You want yourjabroni kids
to play with do”,

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.471
pull down pants,
and see sex? (Laughs)

00:07:11.973 --> 00:07:14.184
(Singing in distinctly)

00:07:15.685 --> 00:07:17.979
Afa: Wow, look how young
you and your dad were.

00:07:19.522 --> 00:07:21.524
Peter loved
listening to you sing.

00:07:21.858 --> 00:07:24.611
He knew I was shy, so he
just kept encouraging me.

00:07:24.694 --> 00:07:26.196
You sound like an angel.

00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:30.033
(Both sing low note)

00:07:30.116 --> 00:07:31.660
(Laughs)

00:07:33.203 --> 00:07:34.996
Hey, is Lia here?

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:36.665
She's in her office with sheik.

00:07:37.832 --> 00:07:39.167
(Dog groans)

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:41.330
The iron sheik: What is
wrong with dog? Lia: Nothing.

00:07:41.378 --> 00:07:43.505
She has tumors.
She's resting. Ugh.

00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:46.383
I'm hosting a barbecue for all
my wrestlers before the match.

00:07:46.591 --> 00:07:48.426
Yes, very exciting.
I go to safeway.

00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:49.678
I get the cupcake.

00:07:49.928 --> 00:07:51.638
The barbecue is a family event,

00:07:51.721 --> 00:07:53.807
so let's run through things
that you can't say.

00:07:54.015 --> 00:07:56.351
No problem.
Sheik only family man.

00:07:56.518 --> 00:07:58.311
All these words here.

00:08:00.397 --> 00:08:01.648
No "(Bleep)"?

00:08:01.773 --> 00:08:03.191
No "(Bleep)"?

00:08:03.274 --> 00:08:05.110
No "(Bleep)"? That's right.

00:08:05.276 --> 00:08:06.903
Okay, boss. (Knocks)

00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:08.613
Lia, I have some bad news.

00:08:09.114 --> 00:08:10.514
It's about
king Kong Bundy's mother.

00:08:10.824 --> 00:08:12.033
Oh, no. Okay,

00:08:12.117 --> 00:08:13.717
send some flowers
and a card should read,

00:08:13.743 --> 00:08:14.828
"sorry for your loss."

00:08:14.995 --> 00:08:17.080
No, she didn't die.
She's not even sick.

00:08:17.163 --> 00:08:18.873
Um, Bundy lied to you.

00:08:18.957 --> 00:08:20.917
He signed a deal
to wrestle for yao.

00:08:21.001 --> 00:08:22.544
That's why he backed out
of our event.

00:08:22.627 --> 00:08:23.628
Lia: Greg yao.

00:08:23.962 --> 00:08:25.481
What kind of promoter
puts his own picture

00:08:25.505 --> 00:08:26.548
in the announcement?

00:08:26.631 --> 00:08:29.843
And who's this Chinese man?

00:08:29.926 --> 00:08:31.428
That word, that okay to say.

00:08:31.553 --> 00:08:32.637
A traitor.

00:08:32.846 --> 00:08:35.223
He worked for Peter,
and when Peter passed,

00:08:35.306 --> 00:08:37.434
yao said he would
never work for a woman,

00:08:37.517 --> 00:08:40.061
so he left, and he started
his own wrestling promotion.

00:08:40.228 --> 00:08:41.396
What a jabroni.

00:08:41.479 --> 00:08:43.440
The sheik love all...

00:08:44.399 --> 00:08:45.400
Women.

00:08:47.152 --> 00:08:49.320
This event isn't on
the same night as ours.

00:08:49.404 --> 00:08:50.572
Why can't Bundy do both?

00:08:50.739 --> 00:08:52.407
Yao made him sign
an exclusive contract,

00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:54.367
so he can only wrestle
for him in Hawaii.

00:08:56.036 --> 00:08:57.476
Bundy is not gonna
work for us again,

00:08:57.996 --> 00:08:59.796
and I'm gonna make sure
Vince hears about this

00:08:59.956 --> 00:09:01.207
and get his advice.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:03.168
I forgot his number.

00:09:03.626 --> 00:09:07.630
Oh, try visualizing the shape
the numbers make on the keypad.

00:09:07.839 --> 00:09:09.132
My mom's number is a square.

00:09:09.466 --> 00:09:10.842
Am I trying
to call your mom, Bob?

00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:12.802
Get me Vince's number.

00:09:17.474 --> 00:09:19.517
Lia: Who lies about
their mom being sick?

00:09:19.601 --> 00:09:21.895
I pray every day
for my mom's good health,

00:09:21.978 --> 00:09:23.772
and she's been dead 20 years,

00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:26.483
and yao, he thinks he can...
Deborah: Hey, Lia.

00:09:26.941 --> 00:09:29.277
Thanks for the barbecue.
Aw, yeah, manuia.

00:09:29.486 --> 00:09:31.738
Anything for my
wrestlers. (Chuckles)

00:09:33.364 --> 00:09:36.076
He thinks he can steal my
guys from the battle royale.

00:09:36.326 --> 00:09:39.746
Bundy should have said no.
You can't back out of a match.

00:09:39.829 --> 00:09:41.498
If you say you gonna do it,
you do it.

00:09:41.623 --> 00:09:43.875
Yes, right.
Sika, write that down.

00:09:44.084 --> 00:09:45.335
I got wing fingers.

00:09:45.502 --> 00:09:46.544
I'll remember it.

00:09:47.212 --> 00:09:49.214
Vince sent me this. Look out.

00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:50.840
(All laughing)

00:09:53.009 --> 00:09:55.428
Hey, don't know
if you guys heard

00:09:55.512 --> 00:09:57.514
Terry and the chief
this morning on the radio?

00:09:57.597 --> 00:09:59.015
Ah, Terry number one.

00:09:59.182 --> 00:10:02.018
The chief, achtoof!
Yeah, I hate the chief too.

00:10:02.102 --> 00:10:04.062
Why is he always congested?

00:10:04.145 --> 00:10:05.385
Yeah. Go see an allergist, man.

00:10:05.605 --> 00:10:07.607
Well, they were talking about

00:10:07.690 --> 00:10:09.484
my autograph signing
this Saturday.

00:10:10.193 --> 00:10:11.486
Dewey's gonna sell merch for me.

00:10:11.569 --> 00:10:13.822
It's gonna be huge. So
how many hats do you want?

00:10:14.447 --> 00:10:16.658
Well, gonna go reload
the Arnold Palmer.

00:10:18.576 --> 00:10:20.328
Too much corn on the grill, Bob.

00:10:20.453 --> 00:10:21.621
People love my corn.

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:23.790
And we found
an old picture ofandre

00:10:23.873 --> 00:10:25.708
sitting on dad's lap. (Laughing)

00:10:25.792 --> 00:10:27.418
Dad looks so tiny.

00:10:27.627 --> 00:10:30.088
Andre loves sitting on people.

00:10:30.964 --> 00:10:32.608
Glad you're going
through those boxes, babe.

00:10:32.632 --> 00:10:34.192
Bet there's some
amazing stuff in there.

00:10:34.217 --> 00:10:36.594
Brother, you should see
some of the old home movies

00:10:36.678 --> 00:10:38.930
that she found. Voice
of an angel. Mmm!

00:10:39.472 --> 00:10:41.712
Whatever happened to your
music? You still writing songs?

00:10:42.392 --> 00:10:43.560
It's just... nothing serious,

00:10:43.643 --> 00:10:44.912
it's just something
I was playing around with.

00:10:44.936 --> 00:10:47.188
Too bad. Ithoughtofyou
this morning.

00:10:47.897 --> 00:10:49.457
There was an ad
in the paper for singers

00:10:49.524 --> 00:10:52.569
to audition for this
new TV show, star search.

00:10:52.777 --> 00:10:54.195
(Scoffs) Yeah, I don't think so.

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:56.114
Why not?
You used to love singing.

00:10:56.197 --> 00:10:59.409
Um, well, you know,
I'm... I'm just...

00:10:59.492 --> 00:11:00.702
Oh, here's my son.

00:11:00.910 --> 00:11:03.454
Dad, I sold a t-shirt.
Nice, son.

00:11:03.538 --> 00:11:04.622
Who's the lucky fan?

00:11:04.706 --> 00:11:05.707
(Chuckles)

00:11:05.790 --> 00:11:07.150
Bob has too much corn
on the grill.

00:11:08.042 --> 00:11:09.502
Has anybody seen junkyard dog?

00:11:09.586 --> 00:11:11.226
He's supposed to bring
the ambrosia salad.

00:11:11.254 --> 00:11:13.298
Ah, yeah, he called.
He said he couldn't make it.

00:11:13.381 --> 00:11:15.216
Something about
his mom being sick.

00:11:18.511 --> 00:11:19.637
You okay?

00:11:19.721 --> 00:11:21.139
Jyd's mom is not sick.

00:11:21.306 --> 00:11:23.141
He's gonna go and work
for Greg yao.

00:11:23.308 --> 00:11:24.517
The hell he is.

00:11:24.726 --> 00:11:26.078
You're the number one promoter
in Hawaii.

00:11:26.102 --> 00:11:27.103
That's not gonna change.

00:11:27.270 --> 00:11:30.440
I know, but yao,
he respects nothing.

00:11:30.565 --> 00:11:33.067
Oh, he gonna respect this.
Come on, let's go. Where?

00:11:33.234 --> 00:11:35.069
To talk some sense
into Sylvester.

00:11:35.236 --> 00:11:36.876
Yeah, I'm gonna put on
my slapping gloves.

00:11:37.572 --> 00:11:39.407
Bob, get some corn for the road!

00:11:39.574 --> 00:11:40.909
They're not ready!

00:11:47.165 --> 00:11:48.875
Where you headed, Sylvester?

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:50.240
Lia: You going to see your mom?

00:11:50.585 --> 00:11:51.794
I heard she was sick.

00:11:52.170 --> 00:11:53.796
First Bundy's, now yours.

00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:55.548
Moms are dropping like flies.

00:11:55.924 --> 00:11:58.176
She, uh, got a hold
of some bad yogurt.

00:12:01.763 --> 00:12:03.003
Are those your slapping gloves?

00:12:03.056 --> 00:12:05.350
(Door closes)
Oh, what you got there?

00:12:05.475 --> 00:12:08.102
Oh, it's a smoked French ham
wrapped in gold cellophane.

00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:12.065
Yao gave it to me

00:12:12.148 --> 00:12:13.500
with a note that said
he want to talk,

00:12:13.524 --> 00:12:16.069
so I called him, and we did.
I'm sorry.

00:12:16.194 --> 00:12:17.612
I hate to bail on y'all,
butlhaveto.

00:12:17.695 --> 00:12:19.822
Why would you choose
to wrestle for him over me?

00:12:19.989 --> 00:12:21.324
I thought we were family.

00:12:21.449 --> 00:12:23.826
We are, but he offered me
a lot more money, Lia.

00:12:24.702 --> 00:12:25.912
Look at this place.

00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:28.039
Somebody either had a baby
or made a baby

00:12:28.122 --> 00:12:29.802
on the other side of
that wall right there.

00:12:31.167 --> 00:12:32.919
He upgraded me to the radisson,

00:12:33.086 --> 00:12:35.088
and I get to do whatever
I want with my persona.

00:12:35.213 --> 00:12:36.589
(Scoffs) Come on, no way.

00:12:36.673 --> 00:12:38.258
Man, I'm telling you
the truth, rocky.

00:12:38.341 --> 00:12:40.677
Imagine me, penthouse dog.

00:12:40.969 --> 00:12:43.304
Get up out the junkyard and
move up into the penthouse.

00:12:43.388 --> 00:12:45.032
Get rid of my dog chains
and get me a briefcase

00:12:45.056 --> 00:12:46.349
full of treasury bonds.

00:12:46.432 --> 00:12:48.893
Mmm-mmm, I'd put
money in the briefcase. Ooh.

00:12:48.977 --> 00:12:50.217
Yeah, stacks of phony hundreds.

00:12:50.270 --> 00:12:51.354
Uh-huh.

00:12:51.437 --> 00:12:52.748
That way,
when you hit somebody...

00:12:52.772 --> 00:12:54.107
Uh-huh.
Cash explodes everywhere.

00:12:54.190 --> 00:12:55.191
Bam!

00:12:55.275 --> 00:12:56.651
Stop pitching on penthouse dog.

00:12:56.859 --> 00:12:57.986
Yao says that'il be a hit,

00:12:58.403 --> 00:13:00.405
and that with him,
I'MMA be a star.

00:13:00.738 --> 00:13:01.781
See, me and rocky,

00:13:01.864 --> 00:13:03.634
we ain't gonna never be
Vince's number one guy.

00:13:03.658 --> 00:13:05.076
It's always gonna be Andre.

00:13:05.201 --> 00:13:06.536
I don't know about that.

00:13:06.619 --> 00:13:08.955
Come on. They didn't even
talk about us during fernet.

00:13:09.038 --> 00:13:10.099
They didn't talk about you.

00:13:10.123 --> 00:13:11.923
You think they talked
about you during fernet?

00:13:12.250 --> 00:13:13.918
What is fernet?
Nobody knows, mama.

00:13:14.002 --> 00:13:16.129
I know. It's a digestif.

00:13:17.088 --> 00:13:19.048
I'm sorry, Lia. I love you.

00:13:20.258 --> 00:13:21.538
And rocky, you my man ten grand.

00:13:22.593 --> 00:13:25.305
But this is an opportunity
that I can't pass up.

00:13:25.471 --> 00:13:26.639
Excuse me.

00:13:27.390 --> 00:13:28.742
Adult Dwayne:
My grandmother realized

00:13:28.766 --> 00:13:31.227
that change doesn't
affect people equally.

00:13:31.311 --> 00:13:34.188
What was best for her wasn't
necessarily best for everyone,

00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:36.357
and my father was wondering

00:13:36.441 --> 00:13:38.234
if change would be best for him.

00:13:40.153 --> 00:13:41.321
(Kids laughing)

00:13:41.779 --> 00:13:43.489
That's me and my cousins
playing a game

00:13:43.573 --> 00:13:44.633
where you had
to jump in the water

00:13:44.657 --> 00:13:45.742
without hitting the rocks.

00:13:45.825 --> 00:13:47.785
The adults just let you do that?

00:13:47.910 --> 00:13:49.704
Well, it was a different time.

00:13:49.996 --> 00:13:51.581
What happened
if you hit the rocks?

00:13:52.165 --> 00:13:54.250
You'd split
your head open and die.

00:13:55.835 --> 00:13:58.087
You won't even let me
use real scissors.

00:13:58.963 --> 00:14:00.506
(Phone rings)

00:14:00.965 --> 00:14:02.800
Hello. Lia, it's Vince.

00:14:02.884 --> 00:14:05.553
Thank you so much
for the kalua pork recipe.

00:14:05.636 --> 00:14:06.905
I couldn't keep my hands off it.

00:14:06.929 --> 00:14:08.473
No time for small talk, Vince.

00:14:08.556 --> 00:14:10.350
I've been very upset. I know.

00:14:10.683 --> 00:14:13.394
I got your messages about yao.
Don't worry.

00:14:14.145 --> 00:14:15.385
I've seen guys like him before.

00:14:15.438 --> 00:14:18.649
All quster, big promises,
but no staying power.

00:14:19.108 --> 00:14:21.652
You're a pro, Lia.
This guy can't touch you.

00:14:22.028 --> 00:14:25.281
Thank you, Vince. I'm
glad you enjoyed your pork.

00:14:25.490 --> 00:14:26.991
It's delicious. Thank you again.

00:14:27.158 --> 00:14:29.202
I do have a bit
of bad news though.

00:14:29.619 --> 00:14:32.139
You know we have that show at
Madison square garden every month?

00:14:32.205 --> 00:14:34.457
Well, I didn't realize
my old man

00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:36.084
booked the garden for your date.

00:14:36.334 --> 00:14:38.795
You're kidding. I'm
locked in that date, Vince.

00:14:38.878 --> 00:14:40.505
I can't change it. I know.

00:14:40.588 --> 00:14:43.633
And, Lia, I would change
our date if I could,

00:14:43.883 --> 00:14:45.803
but Billy Joel is eating up
all the other nights.

00:14:46.052 --> 00:14:48.262
The guy sings about pressure
like it's a bad thing.

00:14:48.638 --> 00:14:50.157
Look, I'm gonna have to call
some of my guys back,

00:14:50.181 --> 00:14:51.784
but I'm not gonna leave
your cupboard bare.

00:14:51.808 --> 00:14:53.893
I won't take rocky
or the wild Samoans.

00:14:53.976 --> 00:14:55.336
I know they're big draws
out there.

00:14:55.478 --> 00:14:56.854
I appreciate that,

00:14:57.271 --> 00:14:59.273
and I understand
you need your guys.

00:14:59.607 --> 00:15:02.777
Appreciate you, Lia. Thank
you, and I'm sorry again.

00:15:03.027 --> 00:15:04.278
Talk soon.

00:15:04.946 --> 00:15:06.280
(Sighs)

00:15:07.198 --> 00:15:10.535
Well, Bob, we've got
bigger changes coming.

00:15:12.203 --> 00:15:13.788
(Dog howling)

00:15:15.957 --> 00:15:18.209
Grandma, something's wrong
with Francine!

00:15:18.418 --> 00:15:20.878
No, that's her way
of telling us she's hungry.

00:15:20.962 --> 00:15:22.922
Do you want to feed her? Can I?

00:15:23.089 --> 00:15:24.882
Just be careful when you
put the bow! Down.

00:15:24.966 --> 00:15:26.426
Don't kick her tumors.

00:15:29.387 --> 00:15:30.930
(Francine barks)

00:15:31.514 --> 00:15:34.100
Are those the boxes
for donation?

00:15:34.267 --> 00:15:35.393
(Speaks other language)

00:15:35.476 --> 00:15:38.604
(In English) They're to keep.
That's the donation pile.

00:15:38.855 --> 00:15:40.523
That place went out of business.

00:15:40.606 --> 00:15:42.608
Lia: (Sighs) So hard.

00:15:42.817 --> 00:15:44.360
I don't want to let him go.

00:15:45.570 --> 00:15:46.988
(Speaks other language)

00:15:47.238 --> 00:15:48.781
(In English)
He's always with you,

00:15:49.031 --> 00:15:51.284
the same way
he's always with me.

00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:53.453
But I won't lie,

00:15:53.870 --> 00:15:57.832
it would be helpful to talk
to him, ask his advice.

00:15:57.915 --> 00:15:59.750
(Laughs) That's funny because

00:15:59.834 --> 00:16:02.378
I remember him always
asking you for advice.

00:16:03.045 --> 00:16:04.714
He believed in you, mama.

00:16:05.423 --> 00:16:06.823
That's why he left you
the business.

00:16:10.303 --> 00:16:12.472
(Chuckles) Oh.

00:16:13.264 --> 00:16:15.683
(Singing indistinctly)

00:16:17.477 --> 00:16:20.563
Your father always loved it
when you sang.

00:16:20.730 --> 00:16:22.023
(Speaks other language)

00:16:22.315 --> 00:16:23.858
He knew it made me happy.

00:16:25.067 --> 00:16:26.736
So why did you stop?

00:16:27.820 --> 00:16:29.155
I don't know.

00:16:29.739 --> 00:16:32.492
Just didn't feel right
to sing without him.

00:16:32.950 --> 00:16:34.285
You're not singing without him.

00:16:35.703 --> 00:16:38.247
You're singing because of him.

00:16:43.544 --> 00:16:45.379
Very good, very good.

00:16:45.922 --> 00:16:47.465
She's number one. (Laughs)

00:16:48.883 --> 00:16:50.301
Lia: (Chuckles)
He's so handsome.

00:16:50.384 --> 00:16:52.345
(Laughs)
Looks like Robert stack.

00:16:52.428 --> 00:16:54.096
(Both laughing)

00:16:54.180 --> 00:16:56.807
Francine peed
and stepped in it a little.

00:16:56.974 --> 00:16:58.476
We've all been there.

00:17:00.186 --> 00:17:01.646
(Both laughing)

00:17:03.689 --> 00:17:04.690
(Soft jazz music playing)

00:17:05.650 --> 00:17:07.068
Waiter: Mr. Johnson.

00:17:07.235 --> 00:17:08.754
Adult Dwayne: Meanwhile,
the only thing I knew

00:17:08.778 --> 00:17:10.363
about all the change going on

00:17:10.571 --> 00:17:11.798
was that we went
from eating fast food

00:17:11.822 --> 00:17:13.824
in our car to eating
at a fancy restaurant

00:17:13.908 --> 00:17:15.910
where you could
look your dinner in the eye

00:17:15.993 --> 00:17:17.119
before you ordered it.

00:17:17.286 --> 00:17:19.288
Turns out, it wasn't
as good as French fries,

00:17:19.372 --> 00:17:20.957
but still fancy.

00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:23.668
So yao gave Sylvester
a smoked French ham?

00:17:23.793 --> 00:17:26.128
To entice him,
which I don't get.

00:17:26.337 --> 00:17:27.814
It don't need to be
gussied up. Wsham.

00:17:27.838 --> 00:17:28.839
We know it's delicious.

00:17:29.757 --> 00:17:32.927
But I do understand
making someone feel valuable

00:17:33.010 --> 00:17:36.097
to an organization.
Babe, I told you.

00:17:36.264 --> 00:17:38.641
My mom said Vince didn't ask
you to work the garden show

00:17:38.724 --> 00:17:40.369
as a favor to her.
Don't take it personally.

00:17:40.393 --> 00:17:42.603
I'm just saying he could
have called me himself.

00:17:43.271 --> 00:17:44.647
Waiter: Welcome to Lorenzo's.

00:17:44.772 --> 00:17:46.274
Can I start you off
with some drinks?

00:17:46.482 --> 00:17:48.943
We'll take a bottle
of your finest champagne.

00:17:49.235 --> 00:17:51.487
Andlwihave your
finest Tequila. Both: No.

00:17:51.696 --> 00:17:53.823
I'll have a vodka Martini.
Both: No.

00:17:53.990 --> 00:17:56.117
Fine, a Shirley temple,
extra cherries.

00:17:58.619 --> 00:18:00.246
See what happens
when you dream big?

00:18:00.621 --> 00:18:02.540
(Chuckles) The sky's the limit.

00:18:03.583 --> 00:18:05.835
Speaking of... yeah?

00:18:06.502 --> 00:18:07.587
I've been thinking about

00:18:07.670 --> 00:18:09.213
that singing show of a mentioned.

00:18:11.132 --> 00:18:14.802
I'm gonna audition. Babe,
that's fantastic. (Laughs)

00:18:14.969 --> 00:18:18.014
I mean, it may come to
nothing, but it makes me happy.

00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:20.224
(Guests clapping)
Do you want a sneak peek?

00:18:24.103 --> 00:18:25.343
Young Dwayne: What's she doing?

00:18:25.646 --> 00:18:26.814
Your mom's full of surprises.

00:18:27.106 --> 00:18:28.107
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:18:28.190 --> 00:18:29.710
we hope you're all
enjoying yourselves.

00:18:29.775 --> 00:18:32.236
We have a surprise guest
for you tonight.

00:18:33.070 --> 00:18:34.470
Her family's been part
of our family

00:18:34.530 --> 00:18:36.240
here at Lorenzo's for years.

00:18:36.949 --> 00:18:38.659
Would you please
put your hands together

00:18:38.743 --> 00:18:41.370
for Mrs. Ata Johnson?

00:18:41.537 --> 00:18:42.580
(Cheering and applauding)

00:18:43.372 --> 00:18:46.042
Hi, everybody.
Room service song!

00:18:46.208 --> 00:18:47.209
(Chuckles)

00:18:47.585 --> 00:18:50.087
As Charles said,
I used to come here a lot

00:18:50.171 --> 00:18:51.797
with my family
when I was younger,

00:18:51.881 --> 00:18:54.467
and tonight I'm here
with my own family,

00:18:54.842 --> 00:18:59.180
and I'd like to dedicate
this song to my dad,

00:18:59.388 --> 00:19:00.389
Peter maivia.

00:19:01.724 --> 00:19:02.975
(Upbeat music playing)

00:19:08.606 --> 00:19:11.275
(Singing) I'm coming out

00:19:12.151 --> 00:19:14.403
I want the world to know

00:19:14.654 --> 00:19:16.322
got to let it show

00:19:16.947 --> 00:19:18.032
that's a good song too.

00:19:18.407 --> 00:19:20.159
I'm coming out

00:19:20.743 --> 00:19:22.620
I want the world to know

00:19:23.287 --> 00:19:25.164
got to let it show

00:19:26.749 --> 00:19:28.334
there's a new me coming out

00:19:28.751 --> 00:19:30.503
and I just had to live

00:19:30.670 --> 00:19:31.730
young Dwayne:
Attention, everyone,

00:19:31.754 --> 00:19:33.631
rocky Johnson fan club
president here

00:19:33.714 --> 00:19:34.914
with an official announcement.

00:19:35.091 --> 00:19:37.051
My dad is game
to sign your body,

00:19:37.218 --> 00:19:38.594
but let's keep it pg, all right?

00:19:39.095 --> 00:19:40.888
Thanks socool

00:19:41.222 --> 00:19:42.848
(dramatic western music playing)

00:19:46.727 --> 00:19:48.604
Hey, my man.
Who can I make this out to?

00:19:48.688 --> 00:19:50.231
Greg yao.

00:19:53.192 --> 00:19:55.403
Yao, yao, yao, come here
to steal more wrestlers

00:19:55.486 --> 00:19:56.566
from my mother-in-law, huh?

00:19:56.696 --> 00:19:58.489
I wouldn't call it stealing.

00:19:58.656 --> 00:20:00.449
I made an offer.
They made a choice.

00:20:00.533 --> 00:20:02.201
Mmm. You got a second to talk?

00:20:02.326 --> 00:20:04.620
If you can talk with my foot
up your ass, go for it.

00:20:04.912 --> 00:20:06.580
(Bothlaugh)

00:20:07.289 --> 00:20:08.624
That's an impressive turnout.

00:20:09.625 --> 00:20:10.626
You're quite a star.

00:20:11.335 --> 00:20:12.962
Big enough
for his own action figure,

00:20:13.879 --> 00:20:17.550
but I hear only Andre's
getting that treatment?

00:20:19.343 --> 00:20:20.970
That's on the house.
Now get lost.

00:20:21.137 --> 00:20:23.180
No, no, I insist on paying.

00:20:25.057 --> 00:20:26.183
(Table rattles)

00:20:27.184 --> 00:20:29.937
You know what that is? That's
an expensive French ham.

00:20:30.646 --> 00:20:33.941
You wrestle for me,
you'll be my number one guy.

00:20:34.483 --> 00:20:36.110
You want an action figure?

00:20:36.694 --> 00:20:37.695
You got it.

00:20:38.779 --> 00:20:40.699
Hell, I'll make your
whole family action figures.

00:20:41.615 --> 00:20:43.743
"Professional wrestler's son."

00:20:44.201 --> 00:20:45.536
My info's on the card.

00:20:48.706 --> 00:20:50.082
What was he talking about?

00:20:51.167 --> 00:20:52.960
(Chuckles)
Oh, it's nothing, son.

00:20:53.043 --> 00:20:54.378
Just, uh just adult stuff.

00:20:55.421 --> 00:20:57.757
Adult Dwayne: My dad knew
his business was changing,

00:20:58.132 --> 00:21:00.217
and he was afraid
of getting left behind,

00:21:00.342 --> 00:21:01.677
and that's a fear! Know

00:21:01.761 --> 00:21:03.512
many Americans
struggle with today.

00:21:03.679 --> 00:21:04.764
(Patriotic music playing)

00:21:04.847 --> 00:21:06.348
That's why, as your president,

00:21:06.432 --> 00:21:09.059
I will make sure none of us
get left behind

00:21:09.185 --> 00:21:11.979
and that change benefits all,
not just some,

00:21:12.396 --> 00:21:13.981
because when I see you,

00:21:14.148 --> 00:21:15.441
I see my grandmother,

00:21:16.275 --> 00:21:17.902
I see my mother and father,

00:21:18.569 --> 00:21:21.781
I see that we're all a part
of one family called america.

00:21:22.239 --> 00:21:24.950
I'm Dwayne Johnson,
and I approve this message.
