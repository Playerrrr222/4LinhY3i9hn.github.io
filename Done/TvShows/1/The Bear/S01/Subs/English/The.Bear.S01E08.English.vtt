00:00:12.554 --> 00:00:14.681
- Welcome back to...
- The Bear.

00:00:14.681 --> 00:00:17.517 line:20%
The Bear. I'm Carmen Berzatto.

00:00:17.517 --> 00:00:20.103 line:20%
And today, we are going
to be making beef braciole.

00:00:20.311 --> 00:00:24.149
This is a very special dish in my
dysfunctional nightmare of a household.

00:00:24.149 --> 00:00:26.901
My brother Mike made this for us
every single Sunday.

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:29.863
- Aww.
- You guys, this is a cute story.

00:00:30.655 --> 00:00:33.575
My brother,
who was addicted to painkillers,

00:00:34.367 --> 00:00:37.078
blew his head off
on the State Street Bridge.

00:00:37.871 --> 00:00:39.080
Bam!

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:42.167
Now, hold on, it gets better.

00:00:42.417 --> 00:00:45.670
- No letter. No goodbye. Nothing.

00:00:45.754 --> 00:00:48.882
Except he did leave me
our family's restaurant in his will,

00:00:48.882 --> 00:00:52.343
which was a nice curveball, considering
he never let me work there with him,

00:00:52.427 --> 00:00:56.181
even though
I am pretty good at this. Right?

00:01:00.727 --> 00:01:04.230
Yeah. I used to run
the best restaurant on the planet Earth.

00:01:04.314 --> 00:01:06.316
It was different
from my brother's shithole,

00:01:06.316 --> 00:01:08.485
which was barely hanging on by a thread.

00:01:09.027 --> 00:01:12.405
So, that was a nice final,
"Fuck you" from Michael, on the way out.

00:01:14.032 --> 00:01:16.367
Anyway... Braciole.

00:01:19.996 --> 00:01:20.997
The fuck?

00:01:24.084 --> 00:01:26.920
Guys? Where's my stuff?

00:01:41.392 --> 00:01:42.727
What the fuck is going on?

00:01:46.147 --> 00:01:47.232
Fuck!

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:48.691
Shit!

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:51.069
- Mike.

00:01:51.486 --> 00:01:53.071
I'm sorry, guys, I'm sorry.

00:01:54.739 --> 00:01:56.866
Look, I'm sorry.
I'm just fucking this up, guys.

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:58.785
I'm just fucking this up.
Stop. Please.

00:02:02.455 --> 00:02:03.581
<i>I'm right here.</i>

00:02:06.042 --> 00:02:07.043
I can't do this.

00:02:08.044 --> 00:02:12.173
Guys, I can't do this!
Stop! I can't... I can't do this!

00:02:19.514 --> 00:02:20.849
<i>You know I got to call it.</i>

00:02:23.977 --> 00:02:25.103
<i>I'm right here.</i>

00:02:31.359 --> 00:02:33.695
<i>Hey, Carm. Hey, can you hear me?</i>

00:02:35.613 --> 00:02:38.908
Get the fuck off my expo, Chef, now!
Get the fuck off!

00:02:39.742 --> 00:02:41.744
<i>Come on,
you're better than this place.</i>

00:02:42.036 --> 00:02:43.037
<i>You're better.</i>

00:02:51.004 --> 00:02:53.089
<i>Set this place on fucking fire, Carmy.</i>

00:02:55.675 --> 00:02:56.843
Why are you...

00:02:57.093 --> 00:02:59.888
<i>Hey, Bear, let it rip.</i>

00:03:10.773 --> 00:03:14.319
Would anyone that's been
to fewer than 15 meetings like to speak?

00:03:38.927 --> 00:03:42.055
My name is Carmen. My...

00:03:43.806 --> 00:03:46.267
My brother is an addict.
My brother was an addict.

00:03:51.105 --> 00:03:52.607
And this morning, I...

00:03:57.612 --> 00:04:00.949
Sorry, uh... I forgot.

00:04:01.074 --> 00:04:04.285
Before I came to Al-Anon, I was a cook.

00:04:04.452 --> 00:04:07.956
I mean, I'm still a cook. I'm just
a different kind of cook, I guess.

00:04:14.295 --> 00:04:18.132
My brother and I, we would cook a lot
together, especially when we were kids.

00:04:18.925 --> 00:04:20.593
That's when we were closest.

00:04:22.095 --> 00:04:23.972
Food was always our common ground.

00:04:27.225 --> 00:04:29.227
We wanted to open a restaurant together.

00:04:29.686 --> 00:04:32.021
We had a name, we had a vibe, all of it.

00:04:37.986 --> 00:04:40.613
My brother could
make you feel confident in yourself.

00:04:42.615 --> 00:04:46.286
When I was a kid, if I was nervous,
scared, wouldn't want to do something,

00:04:46.286 --> 00:04:48.204
he'd always tell me to just face it.

00:04:48.454 --> 00:04:51.165
Get it over with. He'd always say...

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:54.377
Stupid. He would always say...

00:04:56.379 --> 00:04:57.422
Let it rip.

00:05:02.093 --> 00:05:05.555
He was loud, and he was hilarious.

00:05:08.349 --> 00:05:11.561
And he had this amazing ability,
he could walk into a room,

00:05:11.769 --> 00:05:15.189
and he could take the temperature
off it instantly. He could dial it.

00:05:17.692 --> 00:05:18.693
And...

00:05:21.779 --> 00:05:23.823
I'm not built like that. Man, I...

00:05:26.075 --> 00:05:28.202
I didn't have a lot of friends,
growing up.

00:05:29.412 --> 00:05:32.874
I had a stutter when I was a kid.
I was scared to speak half the time.

00:05:33.541 --> 00:05:34.542
And...

00:05:35.126 --> 00:05:37.754
I got shitty grades 'cause
I couldn't pay attention in school.

00:05:37.754 --> 00:05:40.465
I didn't get into college.
I didn't have any girlfriends.

00:05:40.465 --> 00:05:41.549
I don't think I'm funny.

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:52.018
I always thought
my brother was my best friend.

00:05:52.685 --> 00:05:54.854
Like, we knew everything
about each other.

00:05:58.941 --> 00:05:59.942
Except...

00:06:01.986 --> 00:06:05.323
Everybody thought he was their
best friend. He was that magnetic.

00:06:06.324 --> 00:06:07.325
And...

00:06:14.916 --> 00:06:17.001
I didn't know my brother
was using drugs.

00:06:21.255 --> 00:06:22.298
What does that say?

00:06:26.761 --> 00:06:31.182
As we got older, I realized I didn't
know anything about him. Really.

00:06:36.229 --> 00:06:39.190
He stopped letting me
into the restaurant, couple years ago.

00:06:40.066 --> 00:06:42.610
He just cut me off, cold. And that...

00:06:44.695 --> 00:06:45.988
That hurt, you know.

00:06:48.699 --> 00:06:50.701
And I think that flicked a switch in me,

00:06:50.785 --> 00:06:54.038
where I was like,
okay, fuck you, watch this.

00:06:56.249 --> 00:06:58.626
And because we had
this connection through food,

00:06:58.626 --> 00:07:03.423
and he had made me feel so rejected,
and lame, and shitty, and uncool,

00:07:03.423 --> 00:07:05.216
I made this plan where
I was going to work

00:07:05.216 --> 00:07:07.343
in all the best restaurants
in the world.

00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:11.889
I'm going to go work in real kitchens,
like fuck Mom and Dad's piece of shit.

00:07:15.685 --> 00:07:16.978
And it sounds ridiculous,

00:07:16.978 --> 00:07:19.814
me saying that now,
but that's what I did.

00:07:24.569 --> 00:07:26.404
And I got the shit kicked out of me.

00:07:27.947 --> 00:07:29.198
And I separated herbs,

00:07:29.282 --> 00:07:32.535
and I shucked oysters,
and clams and uni.

00:07:33.703 --> 00:07:34.704
And I cut myself.

00:07:35.079 --> 00:07:39.083
And I got garlic, and onions and peppers
in my fingernails and in my eyes.

00:07:39.167 --> 00:07:41.502
And my skin was dry and oily
at the same time.

00:07:41.711 --> 00:07:45.214
I had calluses on my fingers from
the knives and my stomach was fucked.

00:07:45.298 --> 00:07:47.758
And it was... Everything.

00:07:54.724 --> 00:07:57.977
A couple years later, this funny
thing happened, which was like...

00:07:59.228 --> 00:08:00.605
For the first time in my life,

00:08:00.605 --> 00:08:02.899
I started to find
this station for myself.

00:08:08.529 --> 00:08:10.531
And I was fast. I wasn't afraid.

00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:12.992
And it was clear and I felt...

00:08:15.953 --> 00:08:17.538
I felt okay, you know.

00:08:22.752 --> 00:08:26.214
I knew which vegetables went together,
proteins, temperatures, sauces,

00:08:26.214 --> 00:08:29.175
all that shit, and when somebody new
came in to restaurant to stage,

00:08:29.175 --> 00:08:31.010
I'd look at them
like they're competition,

00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:33.221
like I'm going to smoke
this motherfucker.

00:08:37.058 --> 00:08:39.227
I felt like I could
speak through the food,

00:08:39.227 --> 00:08:41.854
like I could
communicate through creativity.

00:08:42.021 --> 00:08:43.439
And that kind of confidence,

00:08:44.023 --> 00:08:47.985
like I was good at something that
was so new and that was so exciting,

00:08:48.069 --> 00:08:49.820
and I just wanted him to know that,

00:08:49.904 --> 00:08:52.198
and fuck, I just wanted him
to be like, "Good job."

00:08:59.288 --> 00:09:00.957
And the more he wouldn't respond,

00:09:00.957 --> 00:09:04.669
and the more our relationship...
kind of strained,

00:09:05.878 --> 00:09:08.297
the deeper into this I went
and the better I got.

00:09:12.802 --> 00:09:15.513
And the more people I cut out,
the quieter my life got.

00:09:17.348 --> 00:09:19.392
And the routine of the kitchen was so...

00:09:21.018 --> 00:09:25.273
consistent, and exacting,
and busy, and hard

00:09:25.773 --> 00:09:28.401
and alive, and I lost track of time
and he died.

00:09:34.448 --> 00:09:35.950
And he left me his restaurant.

00:09:39.996 --> 00:09:43.082
And over the last couple months,
I've been trying to fix it,

00:09:44.542 --> 00:09:47.420
because it was in rough shape,
and it's very clear that me

00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:48.963
trying to fix the restaurant,

00:09:50.381 --> 00:09:53.342
was me trying to fix whatever
was happening with my brother.

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:56.971
And I don't know, maybe
fix the whole family because...

00:09:59.348 --> 00:10:03.019
that restaurant,
it has and it does mean a lot to people.

00:10:09.317 --> 00:10:10.401
It means a lot to me.

00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:18.534
I don't know if it ever
meant anything to him.

00:10:30.129 --> 00:10:32.840
- Heard from Marcus yet?
- No, Jeff.

00:10:33.424 --> 00:10:36.469
- For real, she just missed my asshole.
- Really?

00:10:36.469 --> 00:10:39.305
What happens if you get stabbed
in the asshole?

00:10:39.305 --> 00:10:40.765
You can't sew an asshole.

00:10:41.223 --> 00:10:43.351
I've sewn assholes.
Whose?

00:10:43.351 --> 00:10:44.435
Close friends.

00:10:44.894 --> 00:10:45.895
Chefs!

00:10:46.103 --> 00:10:48.230
Let's bring it
in for pre-service, please.

00:10:48.439 --> 00:10:49.440
Yes, chef.

00:10:49.815 --> 00:10:51.108
Everybody, come on out.

00:10:52.068 --> 00:10:53.069
Okay.

00:10:53.486 --> 00:10:55.279
Look, I hate to be
the bearer of bad news,

00:10:55.363 --> 00:10:57.698
but we're gonna be closed
for dinner service tonight

00:10:57.782 --> 00:11:01.160
because we are having
a bachelor party in the front.

00:11:01.285 --> 00:11:02.453
- Fuck that!
- I know.

00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:04.455 line:20%
I know. It's Cicero's friends, so...

00:11:04.455 --> 00:11:05.748
Yo, Cousin.

00:11:05.748 --> 00:11:08.334
That sucks, Jeff,
I was just getting into the zone.

00:11:08.334 --> 00:11:09.502
No, I know, I get it.

00:11:09.627 --> 00:11:12.838
But it's just for the night,
still gonna rock lunch. All right?

00:11:12.922 --> 00:11:16.092
I'll run point out front tonight,
in case I got to use the big-boy voice.

00:11:16.092 --> 00:11:17.551
I think we'll be fine, thank you.

00:11:17.635 --> 00:11:19.845
You can never tell
with these white-collar criminals.

00:11:19.929 --> 00:11:20.971
Carmen, how many people?

00:11:21.055 --> 00:11:24.517
How many people? I'm not sure,
but we're going to try to keep it chill.

00:11:24.517 --> 00:11:26.143
They're gonna bring their own booze,

00:11:26.227 --> 00:11:29.146
we're gonna have snacks, small plates,
move 'em right through, okay?

00:11:29.230 --> 00:11:30.398
- Yes, Jeff.
- Thank you, chef.

00:11:30.398 --> 00:11:31.899
Thank you, chefs.

00:11:36.028 --> 00:11:37.029
Okay, I see you.

00:11:37.863 --> 00:11:39.407
- You see me?
- Yeah.

00:11:39.824 --> 00:11:41.242
- I...
- Combining ingredients.

00:11:42.159 --> 00:11:44.578
- Yeah.
- Just take the compliment.

00:11:44.662 --> 00:11:45.746
- Jeez.

00:11:47.498 --> 00:11:49.792
Now, I see you adding salt
and everything...

00:11:50.251 --> 00:11:52.294
- No. Yeah.
- You're out of control.

00:11:52.878 --> 00:11:55.047
That's cool,
you didn't even take a day off.

00:11:55.715 --> 00:11:58.926
I don't know about cool. I feel like...

00:11:59.427 --> 00:12:01.971
I'm just the type like,
as soon as I stop I'd...

00:12:04.515 --> 00:12:08.269
- You know?
- Yeah, I feel that. My dad's like that.

00:12:10.938 --> 00:12:13.566
Yeah, my mom's like that.

00:12:19.321 --> 00:12:21.699
I feel kind of bad
because I feel like...

00:12:22.116 --> 00:12:26.245
I haven't really
asked you how you're doing...

00:12:27.788 --> 00:12:30.708
with everything, since, you know...

00:12:31.208 --> 00:12:34.295
Yeah. I mean, I feel okay.

00:12:34.795 --> 00:12:35.796
Better.

00:12:36.505 --> 00:12:38.799
My head just got
real fucked up for a minute.

00:12:39.341 --> 00:12:41.010
I mean, welcome to the club.

00:12:41.761 --> 00:12:43.095
Is that not weird, though?

00:12:43.179 --> 00:12:45.222
It would be weird
to work in a restaurant

00:12:45.306 --> 00:12:46.932
and not completely lose your mind.

00:12:47.391 --> 00:12:48.934
- Yeah.
- Mmm.

00:12:53.189 --> 00:12:56.025
- It's good?
- We're about to find out.

00:12:56.567 --> 00:12:57.568
So, what is this?

00:12:58.068 --> 00:13:01.614
This is Chilean sea bass.

00:13:02.114 --> 00:13:03.199
Got a little...

00:13:04.575 --> 00:13:08.996
Alain Passard inspired tomato confit.

00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:10.706
Then...

00:13:10.998 --> 00:13:14.502
I don't know, herbs, because...
Fuck it...

00:13:14.502 --> 00:13:16.253
You know,
why the fuck not? Yeah.

00:13:16.337 --> 00:13:18.047
Okay. That's what I'm saying.

00:13:19.256 --> 00:13:23.052
So, have you, like, eaten at
all these people that you studied?

00:13:23.719 --> 00:13:26.180
Oh, man! When I was at the CIA...

00:13:27.473 --> 00:13:31.769
The Culinary Institute of America,
not the CIA.

00:13:31.769 --> 00:13:34.104
Thanks for clearing that up,
I thought you were a spy.

00:13:34.271 --> 00:13:37.441
I could do a regime change
if I really felt like it.

00:13:37.608 --> 00:13:39.777
A chef by day, a CIA agent by night.

00:13:40.152 --> 00:13:42.279
Okay, crazier things have happened.

00:13:42.363 --> 00:13:44.073
- Your coordination, though...
- Hey!

00:13:44.073 --> 00:13:47.827
What do you mean, hey? You spilled
veal stock, I've seen you in action...

00:13:47.827 --> 00:13:51.121
I invite you into my home,
and this is how you treat me?

00:13:51.205 --> 00:13:54.416
You reward me with memories,
for cooking for you?

00:13:54.834 --> 00:13:57.878
Anyway, when I was at the CIA,

00:13:58.420 --> 00:14:01.882
I felt like
the biggest idiot on the planet

00:14:01.966 --> 00:14:06.595
because I didn't know half of the people
that anyone was talking about, and...

00:14:07.471 --> 00:14:12.017
I was also so, so broke
when I was there.

00:14:12.268 --> 00:14:15.187
And the moment the semester finished,

00:14:15.354 --> 00:14:18.649
I bought a one-way ticket
to New York, and...

00:14:19.066 --> 00:14:23.737
I spent every single dollar I had,
every last penny, just eating.

00:14:24.572 --> 00:14:27.241
Every single place
that I could think of.

00:14:27.449 --> 00:14:32.329
And one of those places
was the best meal I ever had.

00:14:32.705 --> 00:14:35.207
This is so tight.
So, what was the best one?

00:14:35.624 --> 00:14:39.003
Wait, one second, because I forgot...

00:14:40.671 --> 00:14:43.299
this... and...

00:14:44.466 --> 00:14:45.718
- get ready for this.
- Mmm-hmm.

00:14:46.552 --> 00:14:47.887
Wow. Yeah.

00:14:48.053 --> 00:14:49.680
I had a chef, who...

00:14:50.973 --> 00:14:55.144
would only let me... zest. That was it.

00:14:55.811 --> 00:14:58.939
I worked at the place
for, like, eight months...

00:14:59.398 --> 00:15:00.566
And all I did was zest.

00:15:00.816 --> 00:15:01.817
Well, that's normal.

00:15:02.192 --> 00:15:03.736
- So normal.
- Yeah.

00:15:15.205 --> 00:15:18.959
Wow. This is really,
really, really good.

00:15:20.669 --> 00:15:21.795
Thank you.

00:15:29.011 --> 00:15:30.137
- Nope.

00:15:33.807 --> 00:15:34.975
Fuck, Mikey.

00:15:39.188 --> 00:15:41.774
- Yo, Jeff.
- Yo, what's up, T?

00:15:43.233 --> 00:15:44.985
- Jeff?
- Yeah.

00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:47.321
You good?

00:15:49.114 --> 00:15:50.115
Yeah.

00:15:51.533 --> 00:15:52.743
Yeah, why?

00:15:54.995 --> 00:15:57.706
No. You're not as annoying as usual.

00:15:59.416 --> 00:16:02.002
- Just tired, I think.
- Tired?

00:16:07.091 --> 00:16:08.217
You dress like Syd.

00:16:09.885 --> 00:16:12.012
Like a profesh. Yeah.

00:16:13.180 --> 00:16:14.848
- I like it.
- I like it, too.

00:16:19.353 --> 00:16:22.064
Hey, T. You don't know
anything about KBL Electric?

00:16:22.398 --> 00:16:25.234
Do you? Mikey never mentioned
anything about that to you?

00:16:25.609 --> 00:16:27.778
Who the fuck knows.

00:16:28.821 --> 00:16:30.280
That kid...

00:16:35.035 --> 00:16:36.036 line:20%
What's it for?

00:16:36.954 --> 00:16:37.955 line:20%
I don't know.

00:16:39.498 --> 00:16:41.875 line:20%
He was paying these
big pieces out every month.

00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:45.212
Adds up to the amount
that Cicero loaned him.

00:16:45.546 --> 00:16:46.714
How much is the loan?

00:16:48.674 --> 00:16:49.675
It's a lot.

00:16:51.885 --> 00:16:54.388
It's a lot of bachelor parties
to pay it back, huh?

00:16:55.139 --> 00:16:56.140
Yes, chef.

00:16:58.142 --> 00:16:59.893
Why didn't he just pay the vendors?

00:17:00.310 --> 00:17:01.478
I don't know, Carm.

00:17:02.563 --> 00:17:05.441
I remember there was one month,
we didn't have napkins.

00:17:06.442 --> 00:17:07.943
He wasn't paying them on time.

00:17:08.527 --> 00:17:12.448
I was like, "Mikey, pay these
motherfuckers, we need napkins."

00:17:12.448 --> 00:17:14.825
He was like, "What's the point?

00:17:15.909 --> 00:17:18.912
"We're not going to be able to pay them
next month, anyways."

00:17:20.164 --> 00:17:21.498
Mmm.

00:17:21.999 --> 00:17:23.792
Sounds like that was his attitude, huh?

00:17:24.126 --> 00:17:28.172
No. No. I remember
because it wasn't his attitude.

00:17:35.471 --> 00:17:38.140
Hey, Tina, you go ahead,
you take the night off, okay?

00:17:38.932 --> 00:17:41.101
- I got you.
- Thanks.

00:17:43.437 --> 00:17:44.438
Yo, Jeff.

00:17:47.691 --> 00:17:50.694
You know how much I loved him, right?

00:17:54.073 --> 00:17:55.074
How much?

00:17:56.909 --> 00:17:57.910
A lot.

00:17:59.661 --> 00:18:00.788
I loved him a lot.

00:18:03.832 --> 00:18:04.875
Thanks, Jeff.

00:18:21.183 --> 00:18:22.184
I...

00:18:23.102 --> 00:18:25.646
I had some of your donut the other day.

00:18:25.938 --> 00:18:28.023
- Off the floor?
- Yeah, off the floor.

00:18:28.148 --> 00:18:29.316
Gary keeps it clean.

00:18:29.441 --> 00:18:31.652
No. I don't want to hear...
That's not a good excuse.

00:18:31.652 --> 00:18:33.904
Listen, the man works hard.

00:18:34.279 --> 00:18:35.864
So, what did you think?

00:18:36.073 --> 00:18:38.242
It was really good.

00:18:39.284 --> 00:18:41.995
It was really, really good.

00:18:43.330 --> 00:18:48.293
And I'm really sorry that
Carmy destroyed it like a little bitch.

00:18:50.254 --> 00:18:53.757
That's exactly what he did.
He destroyed it like a bitch.

00:18:54.258 --> 00:18:56.426
- Little bitch. Okay.
- Little, small bitch. Mmm-hmm.

00:19:00.514 --> 00:19:04.143
Have you talked to him yet or...

00:19:04.726 --> 00:19:05.727
No.

00:19:06.395 --> 00:19:10.190
I'm gonna go back,
and we'll hash it out, I guess.

00:19:10.816 --> 00:19:14.862
Or maybe not, and that's just how it is.
Thank you, chef, may I have another?

00:19:15.529 --> 00:19:18.574
Yeah. There is no right answer.

00:19:19.950 --> 00:19:21.368
You're gonna go back to UPS?

00:19:22.953 --> 00:19:26.498
UPS is the crazy shit that
made me want to do this crazy shit,

00:19:26.582 --> 00:19:28.250
so probably not.

00:19:30.335 --> 00:19:32.462
We didn't really eat out
a lot growing up,

00:19:32.713 --> 00:19:37.050
so, when we did it felt special,
even if it wasn't.

00:19:38.010 --> 00:19:40.345
- I don't know.
- I mean, my family was the same.

00:19:41.013 --> 00:19:43.765
Like, for my cousin
Torrell's graduation,

00:19:43.849 --> 00:19:45.684
we went to Michael Jordan's Steakhouse.

00:19:46.018 --> 00:19:47.269
Okay, and?

00:19:47.644 --> 00:19:50.147
What do you mean "and?"
It's the best restaurant on Earth.

00:19:50.147 --> 00:19:53.358
- The bacon? Okay.
- Yes. Exactly. You understand. Yeah.

00:19:53.650 --> 00:19:54.651
It's the best bacon.

00:19:55.944 --> 00:19:57.988
That's what I want to do. I want to...

00:19:58.780 --> 00:20:03.327
I want to cook for people
and make them happy, and...

00:20:03.994 --> 00:20:06.747
give them the best bacon on Earth.

00:20:07.623 --> 00:20:10.125
Even though that spot
is taken, actually.

00:20:10.334 --> 00:20:12.127
- Second best is cool.
- That's great.

00:20:12.336 --> 00:20:13.712
- I'd love that.
- Yeah.

00:20:14.671 --> 00:20:16.006
So, back to The Beef then, huh?

00:20:17.174 --> 00:20:19.801
I don't know.
Knowing me, I'll just probably

00:20:20.719 --> 00:20:22.471
get a job at another spot,

00:20:23.347 --> 00:20:24.723
another after that,

00:20:25.015 --> 00:20:27.684
and I guess just do that forever,

00:20:27.768 --> 00:20:32.064
until my credit
isn't negative one million.

00:20:32.689 --> 00:20:33.774
Uh...

00:20:35.776 --> 00:20:37.819
- You got a dream spot?
- Of course.

00:20:38.028 --> 00:20:39.029
Like what?

00:20:39.613 --> 00:20:43.325
- You'll find out when it's open. Okay.
- Okay. I like that attitude.

00:20:43.617 --> 00:20:44.618
That's how you win.

00:20:44.868 --> 00:20:46.536
Yeah, or lose everything

00:20:46.620 --> 00:20:51.166
and end up living back with your dad
and his stinky, fucking CPAP machine.

00:20:52.626 --> 00:20:55.671
But, it was cool seeing you guys

00:20:55.671 --> 00:20:57.631
be good at different things,
you and Carmy,

00:20:57.631 --> 00:20:59.466
and I learned a lot from you all.

00:21:02.135 --> 00:21:03.679
Wait, what was the best one?

00:21:04.721 --> 00:21:06.765
- Best what?
- Best meal you ever had.

00:21:10.394 --> 00:21:12.437
- You know, it was Carmy's.
- I knew it.

00:21:12.771 --> 00:21:14.273
I knew it. Yeah.

00:21:16.441 --> 00:21:21.113
He is really, really, really good.

00:21:23.490 --> 00:21:24.491
High praise.

00:21:26.743 --> 00:21:29.246
Yeah. But he's still a little bitch.

00:21:29.621 --> 00:21:32.582
Yeah. I won't disagree.

00:21:43.927 --> 00:21:45.304
Fucking asshole.

00:21:47.848 --> 00:21:49.808
I am standing right here doing nothing.

00:21:49.808 --> 00:21:52.519
Not you. Your fucking brother.

00:21:55.897 --> 00:21:57.816
This is a fucking disgrace right here.

00:22:09.369 --> 00:22:10.370
Addicts.

00:22:12.539 --> 00:22:15.667
They say some shit like
they got to help themselves,

00:22:15.751 --> 00:22:20.088
but I should've fucking handcuffed
that motherfucker to the desk.

00:22:21.590 --> 00:22:24.426
- You knew he was using?
- How could you not?

00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:29.723
Because I never fuckin' saw him,
I never fuckin' talked to him.

00:22:29.723 --> 00:22:30.932
He wouldn't take my calls,

00:22:31.016 --> 00:22:32.893
he wouldn't let me
work in the restaurant.

00:22:33.643 --> 00:22:34.895
I should've done more.

00:22:36.938 --> 00:22:39.024
- What could you do?
- I don't fucking know!

00:22:48.992 --> 00:22:50.869
I never thought he was... would...

00:22:53.747 --> 00:22:55.415
You know, he was so loud and...

00:22:57.125 --> 00:23:01.838
obnoxious and fucking hilarious.

00:23:01.963 --> 00:23:05.926
He was Mikey Bear.
I thought he would pull out of it.

00:23:16.103 --> 00:23:17.604
What the fuck.

00:23:17.604 --> 00:23:19.189
Got to be fucking kidding me.

00:23:24.694 --> 00:23:26.196
Hey, get the fuck off.

00:23:26.488 --> 00:23:27.572
That's enough.

00:23:28.323 --> 00:23:29.324
Enough.

00:23:29.616 --> 00:23:31.368
What are you doing?
Enough.

00:23:31.368 --> 00:23:32.536
God, enough.

00:23:54.724 --> 00:23:55.725
Fuck.

00:24:12.576 --> 00:24:15.036
- Any word?
- Nothing yet.

00:24:15.996 --> 00:24:18.123
We'll let you know
the minute he wakes up.

00:24:18.582 --> 00:24:20.083
But he's still in the ICU?

00:24:20.459 --> 00:24:21.460
Correct.

00:24:25.338 --> 00:24:28.758
- What happens if he doesn't wake up?
- He better wake up.

00:24:29.509 --> 00:24:32.471
But I'm saying,
what happens if he doesn't?

00:24:33.388 --> 00:24:35.098
You'll be looking at manslaughter.

00:24:42.772 --> 00:24:46.943
Hold on, guard. Sir? Sir. Officer.

00:24:48.195 --> 00:24:49.196
Hey.

00:24:50.197 --> 00:24:51.406
I need my phone call.

00:25:19.601 --> 00:25:22.646
<i>Hey, this is Tiff.
Leave a message after the tone.</i>

00:25:22.812 --> 00:25:26.900
- Hey, sorry. I know it's late.

00:25:27.067 --> 00:25:29.069
Just, you know...

00:25:30.779 --> 00:25:34.824
I'm just getting off work.
It's been a crazy day. All good, though.

00:25:36.952 --> 00:25:38.119
You know, I was just...

00:25:42.123 --> 00:25:45.877
I was thinking about all that shit that
went down with your dad. You know...

00:25:46.378 --> 00:25:47.629
And...

00:25:49.881 --> 00:25:53.301
How I called him what
I called him. And...

00:25:57.180 --> 00:26:00.850
You were right, you know.
That was not okay.

00:26:01.977 --> 00:26:03.144
And...

00:26:07.732 --> 00:26:09.025
I'm sorry.

00:26:13.863 --> 00:26:15.490
You know, that's pretty much it.

00:26:19.703 --> 00:26:22.330
Hope you guys had a good day.
Give Eva a big hug.

00:26:23.915 --> 00:26:27.502
And... Yeah, I'll talk to you later.
Okay. Good night.

00:27:07.292 --> 00:27:08.960
Jerimovich, let's go.

00:27:11.296 --> 00:27:12.380
He woke up?

00:27:13.340 --> 00:27:15.967
You got lucky.
You get charges of aggravated assault.

00:27:18.511 --> 00:27:20.263
Oh, God! Thank you, God!

00:27:20.680 --> 00:27:22.974
- You're welcome, dickhead.
- Yeah.

00:27:24.351 --> 00:27:26.478
All right. Yeah.

00:27:35.195 --> 00:27:37.238
Yo!

00:27:38.490 --> 00:27:39.491
Yo, Carm.

00:27:41.534 --> 00:27:42.535
Hey.

00:27:43.662 --> 00:27:45.080
- Carmen.

00:27:49.793 --> 00:27:51.628
- You ready to get out of here?
- Yeah.

00:28:20.615 --> 00:28:22.492
Where did you get the money for bail?

00:28:24.828 --> 00:28:26.287
Used our two-week parachute.

00:28:30.083 --> 00:28:31.126
Thank you, Cousin.

00:28:33.503 --> 00:28:34.504
All good.

00:28:38.717 --> 00:28:40.301
Get Ballbreaker ready, yeah?

00:29:03.450 --> 00:29:04.492
You okay?

00:29:06.619 --> 00:29:07.620
Yeah.

00:29:12.584 --> 00:29:13.585
I'm okay.

00:29:21.509 --> 00:29:22.761
You're all I got, Cousin.

00:29:40.111 --> 00:29:41.154
All right.

00:30:18.483 --> 00:30:19.484
Carmen.

00:30:31.079 --> 00:30:32.163
I'm so sorry, chef.

00:30:34.958 --> 00:30:36.084
I'm happy you're back.

00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:38.169
All right, chef.

00:30:42.966 --> 00:30:45.426
- Yo, chef. Yeah.
- Carmen, what the fuck is this?

00:30:45.552 --> 00:30:46.678
What the fuck is that?

00:30:47.095 --> 00:30:48.805
This is my station. This is not respect.

00:30:48.805 --> 00:30:50.723
No, chef. That is not respect.

00:30:53.393 --> 00:30:54.477
Hey.

00:30:56.312 --> 00:31:01.150

- I can't...
- All right. Let's rock.

00:31:25.258 --> 00:31:27.969

00:31:36.436 --> 00:31:38.771
I'm going to be handling her prep
today, chef.

00:31:39.439 --> 00:31:41.774
- Don't fuck it up.
- I'll try my best.

00:31:42.901 --> 00:31:44.360
But seriously, you know,

00:31:45.278 --> 00:31:49.240
if you ever try that shit with me,
I'll fuck your ass up.

00:31:50.658 --> 00:31:51.659
Heard, chef.

00:31:58.124 --> 00:32:00.376
So, I want everybody

We're still going to get a lunch rush,

00:32:09.469 --> 00:32:12.388

locked and loaded please, all right?

00:32:12.472 --> 00:32:14.182
Yes, chef.
Thank you.

No, no. This is... That's pork.
I don't need pork.

I'm just the delivery guy.
Take it up with Lu.

What the fuck is this?

00:36:14.964 --> 00:36:16.883
I don't know. And...

00:36:19.010 --> 00:36:21.512
I didn't really want to
give it to you because...

00:36:22.346 --> 00:36:24.765
it meant that he was gone,
you know, but...

00:36:41.115 --> 00:36:42.116
Okay.

You know, in Somalia, I am grill master.

00:40:23.838 --> 00:40:26.340
Shut up, you old bitch.

00:40:27.550 --> 00:40:30.261
- That's sexist.
- Who's on family?

00:40:31.220 --> 00:40:32.471
I got it today, chef.

Saw you got stabbed back there.

00:41:28.444 --> 00:41:29.612
Yeah, I did.

00:41:29.612 --> 00:41:31.864
It was pretty dope.
It looked pretty cool.

00:41:32.323 --> 00:41:35.784
You just got stabbed, and you
walked it off, it was pretty tough.

00:41:36.494 --> 00:41:40.581
- No shit, it was.
- Pretty tight. Okay, I'll fix this.
