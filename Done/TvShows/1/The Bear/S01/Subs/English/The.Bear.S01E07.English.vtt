"This writer, as all
my readers know, is devoted to Chicago,

Twenty minutes to open!
Chefs, could you set up?

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:33.588
- Yes, chef. Ready to go.
- Thank you.

00:03:33.588 --> 00:03:36.090
"And it's clear
more changes are coming."

00:03:36.174 --> 00:03:38.551
Stop reading that shit.
We got a lot to do today.

00:03:38.635 --> 00:03:41.679
We open in 20. It goes live in 20.
Let's fucking go.

00:03:41.763 --> 00:03:43.890

Where is Tina? She's still not here?

00:03:49.354 --> 00:03:53.316
No, chef. I'm covering her prep.
Can we maybe... Should we, like...

00:03:53.316 --> 00:03:57.111
"Their sandwiches
are so delicious as ever,

00:03:57.195 --> 00:04:02.075
"but the stand-out dish that exhib...
That encapsulates all,

00:04:02.075 --> 00:04:04.285
"this was the risotto with braised beef.

00:04:05.036 --> 00:04:06.788
"The rice was luscious,

"The chef obviously knew
what she was doing."

00:04:13.795 --> 00:04:16.714
Ebra, enough, please. Back to work.
Thank you.

00:04:16.965 --> 00:04:18.925
- So...
- Ribbon of brine, huh?

00:04:19.342 --> 00:04:23.554
Well, I gave a dish to a customer
because I didn't want it to go to waste.

00:04:23.638 --> 00:04:26.516
- I obviously didn't know who he was.
- Chef, it's all good.

00:04:27.684 --> 00:04:30.687
Okay. So, you know, it was an accident,
and it's fine, right?

00:04:30.687 --> 00:04:33.481
- Like it's not weird or anything...
- Good for business.

00:04:33.481 --> 00:04:34.983
- Exactly.
- Yo, Syd, congrats.

00:04:35.692 --> 00:04:37.110
You gotta tell your pops.

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:39.862
For sure. And I just wanna make sure
everything is okay.

00:04:39.946 --> 00:04:42.323
- It's not weird or whatever.
- It's okay, Syd.

00:04:43.157 --> 00:04:45.827
- It's not weird, it's good. All right?
- Yeah. Thanks.

00:04:45.827 --> 00:04:49.497
Sandwiches are totally different though.
That guy is a fucking hack anyway.

00:04:49.497 --> 00:04:51.457
- Totally.
- To-go boxes are ready?

00:04:51.541 --> 00:04:53.001
- Uh, yes. Almost.
- Thank you.

00:04:53.001 --> 00:04:56.045
Sorry! I'm sorry, sorry, sorry,
sorry, sorry!

00:04:56.129 --> 00:04:59.674
Louie got suspended.
Louie, apologize to Jeff.

00:05:00.133 --> 00:05:02.010
- Sorry, Jeff.
- It's all right, Louie.

00:05:02.677 --> 00:05:04.554
Say hello to Jeff's friend.

00:05:04.887 --> 00:05:07.098
- Hi, Jeff's friend.
- Hi, Louie.

00:05:07.098 --> 00:05:09.225
We got a lot to do today.
Please hustle, okay?

00:05:09.309 --> 00:05:11.060
We need you to catch up.
Thank you, chef.

00:05:11.144 --> 00:05:12.645
Yes, Jeff, but Louie?

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:14.105
What about Louie?

00:05:14.105 --> 00:05:17.191
He needs to know... You need to
teach him how to work in the kitchen.

00:05:17.275 --> 00:05:18.651
- Today?
- Today?

00:05:19.152 --> 00:05:22.030
Sure, Tina. Today, the day we're running
the new program.

00:05:22.488 --> 00:05:24.157
Chef Sydney, you got that, right?

00:05:24.532 --> 00:05:26.826
- Yeah, sure.
- Thank you, chef.

00:05:26.826 --> 00:05:29.203
"But it was the coriander-tinged sear

00:05:29.287 --> 00:05:31.539
-"on the tender meat..."
- Ebra? Get to work.

00:05:31.539 --> 00:05:32.623
Please. Thank you.

00:05:32.707 --> 00:05:34.250
- Louie.
- Now, what are you reading?

00:05:34.334 --> 00:05:36.586
A review. Five stars.

00:05:36.794 --> 00:05:37.962
Oh, shit!

00:05:38.046 --> 00:05:40.340
- It's nothing. It's not.
- I'm sure it's good.

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:41.758
Very good one.

00:05:41.966 --> 00:05:43.885
- What's up?
- I need help with him.

00:05:43.885 --> 00:05:47.347
Go wait in Jeff's office,
and think about what the...

00:05:49.974 --> 00:05:52.518
- Seventeen minutes to open, chefs.
- He is, um,

00:05:52.602 --> 00:05:55.521
you know, getting into trouble.
Doing dumb shit.

00:05:55.605 --> 00:05:57.231
Is not interested in anything.
He's so...

00:05:57.315 --> 00:05:58.858
So you bought him here?

00:06:03.196 --> 00:06:05.114
You taught me. You could teach him.

00:06:05.448 --> 00:06:07.116
Teach him what, exactly?

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:09.911
Your skills, man. You got skills.

00:06:09.911 --> 00:06:11.412
- Skills?
- Yes.

00:06:11.829 --> 00:06:15.208
Shabby? This guy is a hacky fuck, right?

00:06:15.208 --> 00:06:17.585
- That's exactly what I said.
- Yo.

00:06:17.585 --> 00:06:20.671
Why is he talking about risotto?
'Cause we don't do risotto on the menu.

00:06:20.755 --> 00:06:23.383
That's a dish
that Sydney's been working on.

00:06:23.383 --> 00:06:26.135
Well, then, how did this fucking
mamaluke try it?

00:06:26.219 --> 00:06:28.388
Sydney accidentally
left it at his table.

00:06:28.388 --> 00:06:30.056
- Accidentally?
- Accidentally.

00:06:31.766 --> 00:06:34.143
Let me ask you...
What's the pickup on risotto?

00:06:34.227 --> 00:06:36.270
That's kinda crazy.
We're not gonna do that.

00:06:36.354 --> 00:06:39.357
No, we're not gonna do that.
Fifteen minutes to open, chefs!

00:06:39.357 --> 00:06:40.608
- Sponge!
- Thank you.

00:06:40.608 --> 00:06:42.568
Shit. Sydney!

00:06:42.693 --> 00:06:44.737
Blowing somebody down at <i>The Telegraph?</i>

00:06:44.821 --> 00:06:47.031
Yeah, Richie.
That's exactly what's happening.

00:06:47.115 --> 00:06:50.076
I'm blowing somebody
down at <i>The Telegraph.</i>

00:06:50.076 --> 00:06:53.079
Louiecito, get over here.
Oh, my man.

00:06:53.079 --> 00:06:54.205
Whoa.

00:06:54.539 --> 00:06:55.748
You bulking up?

00:06:55.832 --> 00:06:57.542
- Trying, yeah.
- You're looking good.

00:06:57.542 --> 00:07:00.920
Okay, can we please go over
the new system today?

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:02.171
You got it, boss.

00:07:02.672 --> 00:07:05.925
Fascinating, how you accidentally

00:07:06.592 --> 00:07:09.137
gave a dish that's not on the menu
to a guy

00:07:09.137 --> 00:07:11.472
- who happened to be a food critic...
- Shut up.

00:07:11.556 --> 00:07:13.182
It's just hard to digest.

00:07:13.266 --> 00:07:15.685
- Sydney, boxes? Thank you so much.
- Yes, chef. Gary, come on.

00:07:15.685 --> 00:07:17.228
What's a ribbon of brine?

00:07:17.228 --> 00:07:19.814
Okay, chefs, listen up! Uh...

00:07:20.273 --> 00:07:22.567
I'm gonna turn on the to-gos
in ten minutes.

00:07:22.859 --> 00:07:24.777
So, we're gonna count off, all right?

00:07:25.153 --> 00:07:28.322
Pars all day! Syd. Salads, count.

00:07:28.406 --> 00:07:30.867
- Twenty-five all day, chef.
- Twenty-five. Thank you.

00:07:30.867 --> 00:07:33.828
- Grilled pars. Tina, chicken?
- Thirty-two all day, chef.

00:07:33.828 --> 00:07:36.789
Thirty-two.
Thank you. Ebra, beef all day?

00:07:36.873 --> 00:07:39.000
- One-hundred, chef.
- One-hundred. Thank you.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.793
Richie, go fuck yourself.

00:07:40.877 --> 00:07:44.172
- Sixty-nine all day, chef!
- And, Marcus! Cakes all day?

00:07:44.464 --> 00:07:47.425
- Uh, uh, give me a sec.
- No. Faster. How many?

00:07:47.425 --> 00:07:48.593
I got a little behind.
I'm gonna catch up.

00:07:48.593 --> 00:07:50.595
Marcus, if you're still fucking
with donuts,

00:07:50.595 --> 00:07:52.263
I'm gonna fuck your day, you hear me?

00:07:52.263 --> 00:07:53.598
- Yes, chef.
- Thank you, chef.

00:07:53.598 --> 00:07:55.808
No, no, no. Uh-uh. No.

00:07:55.892 --> 00:07:58.269
Sorry, guys.
This is the thunderdome right here.

00:07:58.269 --> 00:07:59.937
Take the kindergarten somewhere else.

00:08:00.021 --> 00:08:02.482
Not that I don't appreciate
the giddy-up, you're not there.

00:08:02.482 --> 00:08:05.443
- Okay.
- Okay. Can we please talk about

00:08:05.443 --> 00:08:07.111
- the new to-go system?
- You got it.

00:08:07.195 --> 00:08:09.363
Fellas, I gotta talk to Sydney.
Excuse me, lizards.

00:08:09.447 --> 00:08:12.950
Just take this and do this over
by the deli counter?

00:08:13.075 --> 00:08:14.452
- Yeah.
- Yes, thank you.

00:08:14.452 --> 00:08:16.037
Ten minutes to open, chefs.

00:08:16.913 --> 00:08:20.917
Bravo! All right, boss lady. You did it.

00:08:21.542 --> 00:08:24.962
Got your little dish in the paper.
Little to-go tablet.

00:08:25.046 --> 00:08:26.839
Everything's going according to plan?

00:08:26.923 --> 00:08:28.382
I have a plan?

00:08:28.466 --> 00:08:29.842
This is what you wanted.

00:08:29.926 --> 00:08:31.594
You know, you push my people out.

00:08:31.594 --> 00:08:34.096
-"Your people"?
- Yeah? Push out the working man.

00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:36.599
Make room for whatever
fucking jabronistas

00:08:36.599 --> 00:08:38.184
this stupid article is gonna bring in.

00:08:38.184 --> 00:08:42.980
Sorry, are you the new face
of the working man? Richie, congrats!

00:08:43.064 --> 00:08:44.315
That is huge.

00:08:44.315 --> 00:08:45.691
Food shit aside...

00:08:46.234 --> 00:08:48.069
What's your angle? Level with me.

00:08:48.653 --> 00:08:50.446
- My angle?
- Yeah.

00:08:51.155 --> 00:08:55.076
My angle is that I was hired to
work here, so now I'm working here,

00:08:55.076 --> 00:08:57.370
and I'm trying to bring business in.
That's my angle.

00:08:57.370 --> 00:08:58.538
Wrong kind of business.

00:08:58.538 --> 00:09:01.415
You're bringing in these strokes,
you're gonna box out the OGs.

00:09:01.499 --> 00:09:02.875
Okay. The OGs?

00:09:02.959 --> 00:09:05.628
Yeah. Bus drivers,
secretaries, teachers.

00:09:05.628 --> 00:09:07.880
- Are we just naming professions?
- It's confusing.

00:09:07.964 --> 00:09:10.466
People are gonna know or not know
what's on the menu,

00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:12.635
what's not on the menu.
Is the risotto...

00:09:12.635 --> 00:09:16.889
Okay, well, if there's confusion,
let me help clarify some things. Okay?

00:09:17.223 --> 00:09:19.433
We all work in a restaurant, right?

00:09:19.517 --> 00:09:23.854
And we make food in the restaurant.
We all try to do a good job.

00:09:23.938 --> 00:09:27.567
I don't know about you. But people come
and they buy their food with money.

00:09:27.567 --> 00:09:30.319
And they spend their money,
and we take our earnings,

00:09:30.403 --> 00:09:32.655
and just, you know, live our lives.

00:09:33.322 --> 00:09:35.866
That's it. It's business.

00:09:35.950 --> 00:09:38.911
The point of this
is that it is a business.

00:09:38.995 --> 00:09:43.874
Not a some sort of a hollow shell
you can project your dying fantasies,

00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:45.668
- or whatever onto.
- Don't get nasty.

00:09:45.668 --> 00:09:48.671
I mean, you just don't need to
speak to me at all, I guess.

00:09:48.879 --> 00:09:52.883
By the way, those OGs you love waxing
on and on about all come here,

00:09:53.009 --> 00:09:55.136
split one sandwich
and a free cup of water,

00:09:55.136 --> 00:09:57.263
and then treat the rest of us like shit.

00:09:57.263 --> 00:10:01.309
- So this is a war on poor people?
- This is war on you shutting up, Richie.

00:10:01.309 --> 00:10:03.394
And learning how to use the tablet.

00:10:03.394 --> 00:10:05.229
- The end, dude.
- What's the end?

00:10:06.105 --> 00:10:08.524
The end is that I was telling Richie

00:10:08.608 --> 00:10:11.360
that we are learning
how to use the tablet

00:10:11.444 --> 00:10:14.530
and it's good and good for business,
and you and I agree.

00:10:14.614 --> 00:10:16.115
Yes. Your idea, but yes.

00:10:16.115 --> 00:10:18.367
You agree with me
about the other thing, right?

00:10:18.451 --> 00:10:19.702
- Other thing?
- Other thing?

00:10:19.702 --> 00:10:22.121
That people are gonna come
to get her food.

00:10:22.121 --> 00:10:24.957
That's some fuckin' <i>scusa ma</i>
millennial shit right there.

00:10:25.041 --> 00:10:26.584
- You are not Italian.
- Richie, stop.

00:10:26.584 --> 00:10:29.086
It's a little bit messy, okay?
We will figure it out.

00:10:29.170 --> 00:10:31.172
I just turned on the "To-go" tablet.
Are we ready?

00:10:31.172 --> 00:10:32.673
- No.
- Five minutes to open.

00:10:32.757 --> 00:10:34.008
This is gonna be bad.

00:10:34.008 --> 00:10:35.551
- Chef.
- Yes?

00:10:35.635 --> 00:10:39.388
Sorry. I just don't feel like
we're on the same page right now.

00:10:39.472 --> 00:10:40.765
I feel we're not good.

00:10:40.765 --> 00:10:42.391
- Let's get through the day.
- Chef.

00:10:42.475 --> 00:10:44.435
- What?
- Fuck.

00:10:45.853 --> 00:10:47.021
What?

00:10:50.149 --> 00:10:51.317
Fuck. What the fuck?

00:10:52.443 --> 00:10:53.569
Syd?

00:10:53.653 --> 00:10:55.780
Uh... Okay, uh, I...

00:10:55.780 --> 00:10:57.073
Uh, uh...

00:10:57.281 --> 00:10:59.909
- I don't know.
- You left the pre-order option open.

00:11:00.326 --> 00:11:02.745
- Okay, no. I am sorry.
- Yes.

00:11:02.745 --> 00:11:04.163
What's that mean?

00:11:04.163 --> 00:11:07.667
That means we have 78 slices
of chocolate cake, 99 French fries,

00:11:07.667 --> 00:11:12.546
54 chickens, 38 salads,
255 beef sandwiches,

00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:15.508
due up in eight minutes.
So, yes, Syd, fuck.

00:11:15.508 --> 00:11:17.677
- Yo, I told you.
- You didn't fucking tell me shit.

00:11:17.677 --> 00:11:20.971
Shut the fuck up.
Let me think for a fuckin' second.

00:11:22.056 --> 00:11:24.350
I told you.
I told you be more fucking ready.

00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:26.143
I told you that dish wasn't ready.

00:11:26.227 --> 00:11:27.895
What does this have to
do with the dish?

00:11:27.895 --> 00:11:29.021
Chef, stop!

00:11:32.191 --> 00:11:35.361
Chefs, go to the walk-in.
Get all the cooked beef, slice it,

00:11:35.361 --> 00:11:38.906
put it in jus. Get it now.
Get all 32 chickens.

00:11:38.906 --> 00:11:43.536
Get them searing, roasting.
Tina, sausages, burgers, hot dogs,

00:11:43.536 --> 00:11:46.789
everything on the grill.
Fire everything right fucking now.

00:11:46.789 --> 00:11:48.082
- Yes, chef.
- Yes, chef.

00:11:48.082 --> 00:11:50.960
Contribute in any way humanly possible.
Get out of my fucking way.

00:11:51.210 --> 00:11:55.840
Ebra, make sandwiches.
Don't stop making fucking sandwiches.

00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:57.466
I'm gonna make three sections, okay?

00:11:57.550 --> 00:12:00.302
They're gonna be wet, hot, and sweet,
all right?

00:12:00.386 --> 00:12:01.721
Make sections with green tape.

00:12:01.721 --> 00:12:04.682
Louie, get the sandwiches,
put them in the corresponding sections.

00:12:05.099 --> 00:12:07.143
- Behind!
- Behind!

00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:09.562
- Label that shit, please, chef.
- Yes, chef.

00:12:09.895 --> 00:12:12.982
Tina, fire every single chicken
we have please, okay?

00:12:12.982 --> 00:12:15.234
Richie, do you even know
how to do fries?

00:12:15.234 --> 00:12:17.236
Yes. I know we need them now.

00:12:17.236 --> 00:12:19.363
Okay, Marcus, where are we on cakes?

00:12:19.447 --> 00:12:20.781
Gettin' there.

00:12:20.865 --> 00:12:22.616
Getting there? What the fuck do you...

00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:26.078
Marcus, what the fuck are you doing
still working on this shit?

00:12:26.162 --> 00:12:27.621
What are you trippin' for?

00:12:27.705 --> 00:12:29.457
Come on?
What the fuck am I tripping for?

00:12:29.457 --> 00:12:31.542
- Are you here?
- It doesn't make a difference.

00:12:31.542 --> 00:12:33.919
- There's four cakes and...
- Yeah, I was gonna cut them.

00:12:34.003 --> 00:12:36.630
- They're not even cut yet?
- Yeah, it's not that big of a deal.

00:12:36.714 --> 00:12:40.009
- Chef!
- I am doing them in five...

00:12:40.009 --> 00:12:42.928
No. No. Stop. Everything,
fire everything right fucking now.

00:12:43.012 --> 00:12:44.764
Okay, I'll fire everything now.

00:12:44.764 --> 00:12:46.348
I just was finishing
talking to Marcus...

00:12:46.432 --> 00:12:47.433
Step out.

00:12:47.433 --> 00:12:49.477
Okay, I am gonna
talk to Marcus, order...

00:12:49.477 --> 00:12:51.437
Get the fuck off my expo, chef, now!

00:12:52.021 --> 00:12:54.315
Get the fuck off. Thank you!

00:12:54.732 --> 00:12:59.612
We're firing 76 beefs,
34 chickens, okay?

00:12:59.612 --> 00:13:03.282
Twelve French fries,
12 mash fucking now.

00:13:03.407 --> 00:13:05.201
- Yes, chef.
- Thank you!

00:13:06.702 --> 00:13:08.037
Corner.

00:13:09.538 --> 00:13:12.124
- Five minutes to open.
- Shit.

00:13:12.208 --> 00:13:14.919
You didn't say corner.
You didn't say corner.

00:13:16.003 --> 00:13:18.047
Fuck you, Richie. Fuck you.

00:13:18.047 --> 00:13:20.132
You don't have to curse me
like a maniac.

00:13:20.216 --> 00:13:22.384
- You didn't say corner.
- You're a fucking maniac.

00:13:22.468 --> 00:13:25.930
It's your bullshit that fucked us today,
not mine. Your bullshit.

00:13:26.555 --> 00:13:28.849
- Fuck you, Richie. Fuck you!
- Sydney.

00:13:29.266 --> 00:13:31.769
I like that pace, Louie.
Yeah, baby.

00:13:32.102 --> 00:13:33.187
Chef, you okay?

00:13:33.187 --> 00:13:35.606
Yeah, I am fucking okay, Tina.
Thank you.

00:13:36.649 --> 00:13:39.735
You don't need to be screamin' and shit,
that's not you.

00:13:39.819 --> 00:13:42.822
You know, maybe it is.
Maybe it really is.

00:13:42.822 --> 00:13:44.782
I don't know what you're going to learn.

00:13:44.990 --> 00:13:48.577
Or what Louie is supposed to learn
in this shithole of a place.

00:13:48.661 --> 00:13:51.163
But please just make sure
he keeps up on cakes,

00:13:51.247 --> 00:13:52.915
and that you finish your shift.

00:13:52.915 --> 00:13:55.125
Okay. Yes, chef. I just wanted to
check and see...

00:13:55.209 --> 00:13:58.045
It's fine. Please finish your prep.

00:13:59.171 --> 00:14:00.172
Yes, chef.

00:14:00.256 --> 00:14:02.508
- Hey, need more boxes.
- Still waiting on 55 beef,

00:14:02.508 --> 00:14:05.553
24 chicken and pepper, 41 dogs,
six Greek salads.

00:14:05.553 --> 00:14:08.722
Somebody get me a fucking sharpie
that fucking works.

00:14:09.431 --> 00:14:10.474
Fuck!

00:14:10.558 --> 00:14:12.893
- Fuck. Yo, chef!
- Yes.

00:14:12.977 --> 00:14:14.228
We're out of giardiniera.

00:14:15.187 --> 00:14:17.314
That's fine,
we'll make it fresh. Sydney.

00:14:17.398 --> 00:14:18.983
- What?
- Prep giardiniera please.

00:14:18.983 --> 00:14:20.901
Cousin, out here.
Get me a fucking sharpie.

00:14:20.985 --> 00:14:22.361
- Get me a fucking sharpie.
- Why?

00:14:22.862 --> 00:14:24.905
Chef, hey, prep giardiniera.

00:14:24.989 --> 00:14:28.033
Fuck. We fired two more cakes to-go.

00:14:28.367 --> 00:14:30.619
- No more fucking...
- Fired two more cakes to-go.

00:14:30.703 --> 00:14:31.996
Are you fucking deaf?

00:14:32.496 --> 00:14:34.874
You're extra fucking
confusing today, man.

00:14:35.332 --> 00:14:36.667
Sharpie!

00:14:37.376 --> 00:14:38.586
- Fuck!
- Oh, my God.

00:14:38.586 --> 00:14:40.004
Carmy is very mad.

00:14:40.838 --> 00:14:42.131
Christ.

00:14:42.590 --> 00:14:44.300
Hey, what the fuck are you doing?

00:14:44.300 --> 00:14:45.384
Hi.

00:14:45.384 --> 00:14:46.969
What does it look like? I'm helping you.

00:14:46.969 --> 00:14:49.680
Don't. That's my vegetables, so...

00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:51.807
They're going to the same place.

00:14:51.891 --> 00:14:55.686
It was the prep that was assigned to me,
so they are mine.

00:14:56.145 --> 00:14:57.938
Let go and go away.

00:14:58.022 --> 00:15:01.400
There's something broken in you.
You're bein' mean, it's ugly.

00:15:03.485 --> 00:15:06.405
You wanna talk about
fucking ugly, Richie?

00:15:06.906 --> 00:15:08.908
- You are a loser.
- You're a loser.

00:15:08.908 --> 00:15:11.619
- No, Richie, you're the fucking loser...
- Yeah, you're a loser.

00:15:11.619 --> 00:15:14.455
You're a conceited and condescending
ribbon of brine.

00:15:14.455 --> 00:15:16.582
You can't peel vegetables.
You can't do shit.

00:15:16.582 --> 00:15:19.460
You waste space here.
You are a fucking loser

00:15:19.460 --> 00:15:21.879
and that is why you hate
that I am here, right?

00:15:21.879 --> 00:15:26.133
Because I see you for the loser
that you fucking are,

00:15:26.133 --> 00:15:27.801
and everybody knows it.

00:15:27.885 --> 00:15:30.721
I know it, Carmen knows it,
your daughter probably knows it.

00:15:30.721 --> 00:15:33.766
Poor fucking girl. So, how about
you go to the register

00:15:33.766 --> 00:15:35.559
and do the one thing
you know how to do?

00:15:35.643 --> 00:15:38.187
Why you being such a fucking bitch
right now?

00:15:38.187 --> 00:15:40.606
I don't know, Richie. Why am I?

00:15:40.606 --> 00:15:43.150
- You're gonna fucking stab me?
- Maybe I fucking will.

00:15:43.150 --> 00:15:45.569
Giardiniera! Shut the fuck up.

00:15:46.403 --> 00:15:49.365
Yo, Carmy, I did it.
I figured out what I was doin' wrong.

00:15:49.365 --> 00:15:52.076
I was trying to make a cake donut,
it should've been yeast.

00:15:52.076 --> 00:15:53.994
- And I've...
- Why are you fucking with me?

00:15:57.915 --> 00:16:01.251
Why are you fucking with me?
Get the fuck back to work.

00:16:01.669 --> 00:16:05.130
Move. Everybody. Fucking idiots!

00:16:05.214 --> 00:16:07.716
Yo, Cousin. Just fuckin'...

00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:08.801
Shut the fuck up!

00:16:08.801 --> 00:16:10.344
- Ah!

00:16:10.469 --> 00:16:12.137
Fuck! Motherfuck...

00:16:12.221 --> 00:16:14.348
- Yo, we have a customer out here.
- I got stabbed.

00:16:14.348 --> 00:16:16.684
Not right now. I got stabbed.
Son of a fucking...

00:16:16.684 --> 00:16:18.394
- Ebraheim.
- Open in one minute!

00:16:18.394 --> 00:16:21.146
- Ebraheim, I got stabbed.
- Probably fucking deserved it.

00:16:21.563 --> 00:16:23.107
Yeah. Maybe.

00:16:23.107 --> 00:16:24.525
Yo, Louie, how we lookin'?

00:16:25.025 --> 00:16:26.360
- Good.
- Good? Sweets?

00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:28.487
- Thirty-seven.
- Keep going.

00:16:28.487 --> 00:16:29.571
Thank you, chef.

00:16:29.655 --> 00:16:32.282
- Ebraheim, need that fucking fast.
- I am trying.

00:16:33.075 --> 00:16:34.493
- Don't move.
- Fuck.

00:16:37.204 --> 00:16:40.332
Is it bad?
Tell me about the factions again.

00:16:40.416 --> 00:16:41.542
Stop moving.

00:16:42.501 --> 00:16:46.380
Siad Barre caused violence,
oppression, civil war.

00:16:47.214 --> 00:16:49.800
Many factions, many groups,
all fighting for power.

00:16:50.384 --> 00:16:54.138
The central government collapsed,
Somalia became a failed state.

00:16:54.763 --> 00:16:56.348
Many civilians were killed.

00:16:56.849 --> 00:16:59.768
Muhammad Farah Aydid would not
cooperate with United Nations.

00:16:59.852 --> 00:17:02.187
United States sent troops
to take members

00:17:02.271 --> 00:17:04.148
of his team, tried to create peace.

00:17:04.148 --> 00:17:05.983
But it didn't create peace, did it?

00:17:06.358 --> 00:17:10.070
No. Battle of Mogadishu started
when two helicopters came and...

00:17:10.154 --> 00:17:14.533
Hey, wait! Is this shit fuckin'
<i>Black Hawk Down?</i>

00:17:14.533 --> 00:17:15.659
<i>Black Hawk Down.</i>

00:17:17.036 --> 00:17:19.038
- Fuckin' Piven.
- Piven.

00:17:28.922 --> 00:17:31.175
Where the fuck is Marcus?

00:17:33.010 --> 00:17:34.511
Yo, Jeff, we gotta open.

00:17:34.595 --> 00:17:36.513
One minute.
Twenty more chickens. Fire.

00:17:37.056 --> 00:17:38.223
We don't have any more.

00:17:38.307 --> 00:17:41.018
Fuckin' find them.
God fucking damn it, Tina.

00:17:47.649 --> 00:17:49.902
- Do you guys have a soda?
- No.

00:17:50.277 --> 00:17:51.528
No.

00:17:51.987 --> 00:17:53.405
Yo, we good?

00:17:53.489 --> 00:17:55.616
Will you keep your thumb off
your ass, man?

00:17:55.616 --> 00:17:57.534
- Chef, we good?
- Corner.

00:17:59.745 --> 00:18:01.163
Chef, I can't hear you.

00:18:01.914 --> 00:18:03.040
We are not good.

00:18:03.749 --> 00:18:04.875
What?

00:18:05.250 --> 00:18:07.753
- We are not good, chef.
- No?

00:18:08.754 --> 00:18:10.672
What the fuck are you talkin' about?

00:18:11.924 --> 00:18:13.258
What's goin' on?

00:18:15.594 --> 00:18:16.637
Um...

00:18:17.513 --> 00:18:19.765
I quit, is what's going on.

00:18:19.765 --> 00:18:22.768
- Quit? Right now?
- Yes, chef. I fucking quit.

00:18:23.018 --> 00:18:24.394
You quit right now?

00:18:31.693 --> 00:18:32.903
What are you doing?

00:18:34.446 --> 00:18:37.157
- You are an excellent chef.
- What are you doing?

00:18:37.741 --> 00:18:40.744
- You are also a piece of shit.
- What are you doing?

00:18:41.829 --> 00:18:44.331
- This isn't on me. Good luck!
- What are you doing?

00:18:51.463 --> 00:18:52.589
Shit.

00:19:14.528 --> 00:19:15.529
Fuck!

00:19:15.529 --> 00:19:18.365
Yo, Cousin, there's
a fuckin' line. Are we open or not?
