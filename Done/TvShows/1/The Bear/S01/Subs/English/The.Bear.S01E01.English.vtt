WEBVTT

00:00:46.963 --> 00:00:47.964
It's okay.

00:01:06.024 --> 00:01:07.025
I know.

00:01:30.965 --> 00:01:32.634
- Yo.
- Yo. 25 pounds?

00:01:32.634 --> 00:01:35.345
- 25 pounds. No, no, no. I ordered 200.
- Paid for 25.

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:36.846
Take it up with Lou.

00:01:43.186 --> 00:01:44.312
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:01:44.312 --> 00:01:46.940
No, no, no. I mean,
that's really nice of you.

00:01:48.316 --> 00:01:49.359
Uh-huh.

00:01:51.402 --> 00:01:54.572
Yeah. No, no, we're really grateful
to still be open after everything.

00:01:55.448 --> 00:01:56.658
Yeah. So, listen, I, um...

00:01:57.951 --> 00:01:59.828
I'm still trying
to figure this place out.

00:02:01.037 --> 00:02:04.332
Michael was doing everything.
I want to get you your money.

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:09.420
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, I miss him.
I miss him, too.

00:02:09.963 --> 00:02:10.964
Yeah.

00:02:13.174 --> 00:02:14.175
Okay.

00:02:15.635 --> 00:02:16.636
No, it's good. Yeah.

00:02:16.761 --> 00:02:19.055
Okay. Thanks, anyway. Yeah, yeah.

00:02:19.305 --> 00:02:20.306
Bye.

00:02:26.271 --> 00:02:27.272
Fuck!

00:02:27.272 --> 00:02:28.815
<i>Ballbreaker!</i>

00:02:28.815 --> 00:02:30.191
<i>Ball broken!</i>

00:02:31.693 --> 00:02:33.736
- Shut up!
- No, no, no, no, <i>puta.</i>

00:02:33.903 --> 00:02:36.656
- Don't unplug it.
- I know what it means.

00:02:36.656 --> 00:02:38.491
You unplug it, it won't work again.

00:02:39.367 --> 00:02:41.411
When was the last time
you emptied these?

00:02:41.411 --> 00:02:42.579
I don't know.

00:03:07.061 --> 00:03:09.397
Hey, Chi-Chi, it's Carmy.
Still got the meat connect?

00:03:26.289 --> 00:03:28.041
You cut vegetables like a bitch.

00:03:28.041 --> 00:03:30.001
Don't wipe your hands
on your apron, Chef.

00:03:30.001 --> 00:03:31.127
Jeff?

00:03:31.628 --> 00:03:32.629
Chef.

00:03:54.484 --> 00:03:56.986
We got issues. This arcuate's painted.

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:59.447
No shit. They conserved copper
during World War II.

00:03:59.447 --> 00:04:00.782
That's why there's no rivets?

00:04:00.782 --> 00:04:02.533
Yes. How do you not know that?

00:04:02.617 --> 00:04:03.868
Because I fucking don't.

00:04:03.952 --> 00:04:07.789
This is original Big E Redline Selvedge.
All right? From 1944.

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:09.916
<i>You can get $1250 for that
on eBay tonight.</i>

00:04:09.916 --> 00:04:12.502
- I'd still be five-and-a half short.
- Add this.

00:04:13.002 --> 00:04:15.171
- What am I, a Coinstar?
- That's three hundo.

00:04:15.255 --> 00:04:16.381
Three hundo plus what?

00:04:18.216 --> 00:04:20.843
Plus a 1955 blanket-lined Type 3.

00:04:20.927 --> 00:04:22.262
- Pleated?
- Pleated.

00:04:22.845 --> 00:04:23.846
Sold.

00:05:02.051 --> 00:05:03.177
Hey, Sugar.

00:05:03.261 --> 00:05:04.971
Yeah. Look, I need your help.

00:05:05.555 --> 00:05:08.057
No. No, no, no. It's not like that.

00:05:08.975 --> 00:05:11.185
Yeah, I need that jacket
that Mike gave me.

00:05:11.978 --> 00:05:13.771
Yeah, look, can you bring it here?

00:05:15.523 --> 00:05:16.733
Thank you. Okay.

00:05:16.733 --> 00:05:18.735
Yeah. Yeah. All right. All right. Bye.

00:05:20.945 --> 00:05:22.113
Hi. Hello.

00:05:22.905 --> 00:05:23.906
Hi.

00:05:24.324 --> 00:05:25.325
I'm Sydney.

00:05:25.575 --> 00:05:26.951
I called about the sous position.

00:05:27.035 --> 00:05:28.619
- I'm staging today.
- Right.

00:05:28.703 --> 00:05:30.997
- Shit. Sorry. Yes. Carmy.
- Yeah.

00:05:30.997 --> 00:05:33.374
- Here. You can give me... Thank you.
- Yes.

00:05:33.541 --> 00:05:37.086
Uh, Alinea, Smoque, Avec...
That's some serious heat.

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:38.171
What's...

00:05:39.088 --> 00:05:40.965
What's UPS? That's in Chicago or?

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:43.217
Uh, United Parcel Service.

00:05:43.926 --> 00:05:47.221
- Shit. That's the UPS. Yeah.
- The one... The mail... Yeah.

00:05:47.305 --> 00:05:48.598
What'd you do for them?

00:05:48.598 --> 00:05:51.184
Drove. Paid my way
through culinary school, so...

00:05:51.601 --> 00:05:53.186
- CIA?
- CIA, yeah.

00:05:54.103 --> 00:05:55.813
Okay. So what are you doing here?

00:05:57.315 --> 00:05:58.399
You know, this...

00:05:59.025 --> 00:06:01.903
This was my dad's favorite spot
when I was a kid.

00:06:03.154 --> 00:06:04.364
Come here every Sunday.

00:06:05.573 --> 00:06:06.574
Special place.

00:06:07.283 --> 00:06:08.409
Good. Um...

00:06:09.535 --> 00:06:11.204
Okay, so you know the drill.

00:06:11.204 --> 00:06:15.041
We... You're going to make family.
It's meat plus three.

00:06:15.041 --> 00:06:17.877
- And we eat around 2:00.
- Yeah, heard. Dope. Cool.

00:06:19.754 --> 00:06:20.755
What's up?

00:06:22.006 --> 00:06:24.217
Can I just, like, ask you a question, maybe?

00:06:24.217 --> 00:06:25.301
Of course. Yeah.

00:06:26.969 --> 00:06:27.970
I know who you are.

00:06:28.513 --> 00:06:29.722
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

00:06:29.806 --> 00:06:34.727
I mean, you're the most excellent CDC
at the most excellent restaurant

00:06:34.811 --> 00:06:37.146
in the entire United States of America.

00:06:38.523 --> 00:06:40.650
So, what are you doing here, I guess?

00:06:43.152 --> 00:06:44.153
Making sandwiches.

00:06:47.156 --> 00:06:48.157
- Tina. Ebraheim.
- Carmen.

00:06:48.241 --> 00:06:49.659
- Where is beef?
- In the oven.

00:06:49.659 --> 00:06:51.536
Tina, can you start a new jardinière?

00:06:51.536 --> 00:06:53.287
I need my fennel first, Jeff.

00:06:53.579 --> 00:06:54.622
- Carmen.
- Ebraheim.

00:06:54.622 --> 00:06:55.832
I need my beef.

00:06:55.832 --> 00:06:57.583
Then I do onions, then potatoes.

00:06:57.667 --> 00:06:59.794
- We have a system.
- You can punch 'em, blanche 'em,

00:06:59.794 --> 00:07:01.379
freeze 'em, fry 'em before the beef.

00:07:01.379 --> 00:07:04.006
- Don't mess up our place.
- I'm not messing anything up.

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:06.092
Chef, no!
Please, please do not touch that.

00:07:06.092 --> 00:07:08.678
This is the one time you listen to me.
Do not touch that.

00:07:08.678 --> 00:07:11.889
- That's been going for 12 hours, okay?
- That's my pot, Jeff.

00:07:11.973 --> 00:07:13.724
- Everybody knows.
- That's her pot.

00:07:13.808 --> 00:07:15.226
- That's my pot.
- Use another pot.

00:07:15.226 --> 00:07:17.145
Please. Chef. All right? Corner!

00:07:19.439 --> 00:07:20.940
Marcus, double order of bread today.

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:22.024
- Okay, Chef?
- Come on.

00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:23.901
I've been telling you
the mixer's fucked.

00:07:23.985 --> 00:07:24.986
I gotta do this by hand.

00:07:24.986 --> 00:07:27.697
Tina keeps messing with the
temperature, it's fucking up my rise.

00:07:27.697 --> 00:07:29.782
- Tina, I know you speak English.

00:07:29.866 --> 00:07:32.368
Marcus, we're not meeting dailies.
Vendors are cutting us off.

00:07:32.452 --> 00:07:34.120
I don't have the money
right this second.

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:36.414
But I will get you a new mixer. Okay?
I promise you.

00:07:36.414 --> 00:07:38.082
- Carmen, buzzer.

00:07:38.166 --> 00:07:40.001
That's the beef.
Come on, give me a hand.

00:07:40.001 --> 00:07:42.503
Smaller. Smaller fry scoops today, Chef.

00:07:42.587 --> 00:07:44.672
- Behind! What is this system?
- Not system.

00:07:44.672 --> 00:07:46.549
- Michael's system.
- Carmen, there's a girl.

00:07:46.549 --> 00:07:48.217
That's Sydney. She's helping us today.

00:07:48.301 --> 00:07:49.677
Michael's system makes no sense.

00:07:49.677 --> 00:07:51.679
- I'm saying something.
- Marcus.

00:07:51.679 --> 00:07:53.222
You are my favorite bitch.

00:07:53.306 --> 00:07:55.683
Your English is getting tight.
Kidnap a ship captain?

00:07:55.683 --> 00:07:57.268
Your mom teach me during sex.

00:07:57.268 --> 00:08:00.104
Oh, that's not cool.
That's how you're doing it.

00:08:00.521 --> 00:08:01.564
Hey, yo.

00:08:01.564 --> 00:08:03.024
Set up a compost for me today?

00:08:03.149 --> 00:08:06.027
- After I do my thing in the place.
- Very clear. Thank you.

00:08:06.027 --> 00:08:07.445
Behind, behind.

00:08:07.445 --> 00:08:10.323
Hey, Chef, is there, like,
a family shelf or something?

00:08:10.323 --> 00:08:11.407
- Behind.
- Shelf?

00:08:20.374 --> 00:08:21.375
Fuck off.

00:08:23.252 --> 00:08:24.253
<i>Gracias.</i>

00:08:25.963 --> 00:08:27.381
Bottom right side of walk-in.

00:08:28.216 --> 00:08:29.217
Thanks, Chef.

00:08:35.306 --> 00:08:36.807
- This shit looks different.
- Corner!

00:08:36.891 --> 00:08:38.017
Yo, family.

00:08:38.017 --> 00:08:39.227
Yo. You!

00:08:40.353 --> 00:08:41.979
Fucking with my program, cousin?

00:08:42.396 --> 00:08:43.814
Program started four hours ago.

00:08:43.898 --> 00:08:45.942
I had the kid all morning. Excuse me.

00:08:45.942 --> 00:08:49.320
What is going on with Ballbreaker?
My Insta's completely blowing up.

00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:50.404
You got 30 followers.

00:08:50.488 --> 00:08:53.866
Yeah, I got... What is that, a diss?
I got 36 followers, you fucking...

00:08:56.577 --> 00:08:59.747
We need the business.
Nerds come in from Rockford to play.

00:08:59.747 --> 00:09:01.415
Yeah, like in 1987.

00:09:01.499 --> 00:09:03.584
When you were still
in that deadbeat's balls.

00:09:03.668 --> 00:09:05.419
- How are you?
- How was the recital?

00:09:05.503 --> 00:09:08.422
Oh, my God, she murdered it, Tina.
I gotta... Hold...

00:09:08.506 --> 00:09:10.591
Hold on.
Listen, you got to run this stuff by me.

00:09:10.675 --> 00:09:11.717
I don't have to do shit.

00:09:11.801 --> 00:09:14.387
Hold on. Listen, let's just have
a conversation for a second.

00:09:14.512 --> 00:09:15.972
Whoa. Fuck is this?

00:09:15.972 --> 00:09:17.807
This is Sydney. I'm staging today.

00:09:18.099 --> 00:09:19.225
You're what-ing today?

00:09:19.225 --> 00:09:20.476
Sydney's helping out today.

00:09:20.601 --> 00:09:22.061
You ordered different mayonnaise?

00:09:22.061 --> 00:09:24.063
- Gonna use these bananas?
- No. All you, Chef.

00:09:24.063 --> 00:09:25.273
Yeah, all you, Chef.

00:09:25.273 --> 00:09:27.233
He was using them to make a giant
nut muffin.

00:09:27.233 --> 00:09:30.444
A panettone. Would've been beautiful
if you'd let me finish it.

00:09:30.528 --> 00:09:31.779
- Fuck you.
- Cousin!

00:09:31.779 --> 00:09:34.115
Richie Jeremovich.
Pleasure to meet you, sweetheart.

00:09:34.115 --> 00:09:36.909
- Don't say "sweetheart."
- Sorry, Carm. You're so woke.

00:09:36.993 --> 00:09:38.703
I meant nothing by it, Sydney.

00:09:38.703 --> 00:09:40.746
Saying sweetheart
is just our Italian heritage.

00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:41.831
That's beautiful.

00:09:41.831 --> 00:09:43.040
Corner!

00:09:43.124 --> 00:09:45.710
Hey, listen,
I'm trying to talk to you, okay?

00:09:45.710 --> 00:09:48.713
Don't be rude and start doing
a million things like a smartass.

00:09:48.713 --> 00:09:51.799
I don't have time for this.
Don't you fucking start...

00:09:51.799 --> 00:09:53.259
No, don't you fucking!

00:09:53.259 --> 00:09:55.678
I got all kinds of receipts
from my divorce lawyer,

00:09:55.678 --> 00:09:58.139
'cause I've been trying
to put your family back together

00:09:58.139 --> 00:10:00.641
'cause you're too much of a cocksucker
to come home.

00:10:02.059 --> 00:10:03.477
The guys are texting me.

00:10:03.561 --> 00:10:05.896
You're telling them to do
weird shit backwards.

00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:07.565
Don't fucking do that, Carmy.

00:10:07.982 --> 00:10:10.985
Don't mess with their heads,
and ordering different mayonnaise,

00:10:10.985 --> 00:10:13.946
and hiring new fucking broads
without talking to me first.

00:10:14.530 --> 00:10:16.574
This is your brother's house, okay?

00:10:16.574 --> 00:10:19.160
Yeah? Remember?
I was running it fine without you.

00:10:20.286 --> 00:10:22.079
Why didn't he leave it to you then?

00:10:25.249 --> 00:10:26.584
Low on olive oil, Carmen.

00:10:27.668 --> 00:10:28.669
Heard.

00:10:35.551 --> 00:10:36.552
Where's my knife?

00:10:39.555 --> 00:10:41.932
Chefs, we gotta sharpen our knives
when we get a sec.

00:10:42.016 --> 00:10:44.060
We got to sharpen your brain
when you get a sec.

00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:45.519
You've been here for two weeks,

00:10:45.603 --> 00:10:47.688
we've been having
money problems for two weeks.

00:10:47.772 --> 00:10:49.940
One plus one equals
you're an asshole, Bobby Flay.

00:10:50.024 --> 00:10:52.652
Don't call me Bobby Flay.
Sydney, you stir that pot for me.

00:10:52.652 --> 00:10:53.819
You want a cartouche?

00:10:53.903 --> 00:10:56.364
- What's a "cartoonsh"?
- What's our best day here?

00:10:56.364 --> 00:10:59.283
- Five.
- Okay, get me a pot for the jardinière.

00:10:59.367 --> 00:11:01.869
So if we do six, that'll get us
through the week, right?

00:11:01.869 --> 00:11:04.413
- So, Ballbreaker.
- Just make it easy

00:11:04.497 --> 00:11:06.457
and make the fucking spaghetti.

00:11:06.457 --> 00:11:08.709
Don't say spaghetti.
All these knives are dull.

00:11:08.793 --> 00:11:10.920
Spaghetti's the biggest seller.
Straight-up fire.

00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:12.797
Straight-up done now, Chef. Behind.

00:11:12.797 --> 00:11:15.716
- Yeah, but why?
- Because fucking Eleven Madison Park

00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:17.635
dickhead here
couldn't figure it out.

00:11:17.635 --> 00:11:20.054
- Housekeeping, Chefs.
- What the fuck are you saying?

00:11:20.054 --> 00:11:21.347
Anyone understand?

00:11:21.347 --> 00:11:23.891
Housekeeping means you have
to clean your stations

00:11:23.891 --> 00:11:25.810
because this place is fucking gross.

00:11:25.810 --> 00:11:28.979
I refer to everybody as chef
because it's a sign of respect.

00:11:29.063 --> 00:11:31.065
I never said I couldn't
figure out the spaghetti.

00:11:31.065 --> 00:11:34.985
I said it doesn't make any sense
on this menu, so it is done. The end.

00:11:36.028 --> 00:11:37.822
Three hours to open, chefs.

00:11:37.822 --> 00:11:39.824
Who are you yelling at, Carmy?

00:11:39.824 --> 00:11:43.077
There's like four of us in here.
Let me ask you something.

00:11:43.077 --> 00:11:47.498
If the spaghetti didn't make any sense,
how come everybody loved that shit?

00:11:47.498 --> 00:11:49.500
Everybody doesn't have any taste.

00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:51.711
It was an under-seasoned,
over-sauced mess.

00:11:51.711 --> 00:11:53.295
It took seven hours to prep.

00:11:53.379 --> 00:11:57.633
What? This shit right here
made you pompous and delusional,

00:11:57.758 --> 00:12:01.971
and a fucking gayrod. These guys taught
you how to cook with your hands,

00:12:01.971 --> 00:12:05.015
but none of these fuckwads
taught you how to make a pasta.

00:12:05.099 --> 00:12:06.350
You know how to make pasta?

00:12:06.434 --> 00:12:08.102
A, I know how to make pasta, Marcus.

00:12:08.102 --> 00:12:10.104
B, I hate to break your hearts,

00:12:10.104 --> 00:12:13.441
but that gooey, mushy bullshit
is not bailing us out this time.

00:12:13.441 --> 00:12:16.318
Ballbreaker is.
Fak's raising plays to a dollar.

00:12:16.402 --> 00:12:17.903
- So shut the fuck up.
- Who's Fak?

00:12:17.987 --> 00:12:19.739
Tina, did you take my knife, Chef?

00:12:19.739 --> 00:12:21.282
Did you take my pot, Jeff?

00:12:23.451 --> 00:12:25.619
- Fuck!
- Neil Fak.

00:12:25.703 --> 00:12:29.123
This fucking fairy's butt-buddy.
He's... Whoa.

00:12:30.207 --> 00:12:31.500
Why is the beef so hot?

00:12:31.625 --> 00:12:33.085
'Cause we just took it out.

00:12:33.169 --> 00:12:35.212
- Two hours late?
- Two hours longer.

00:12:35.296 --> 00:12:36.881
Wrigley didn't deliver enough meat.

00:12:36.881 --> 00:12:40.050
- Why didn't Wrigley deliver?
- Because we're out of money!

00:12:40.134 --> 00:12:43.137
The only beef I could get was bone-in,
which has to braise.

00:12:43.137 --> 00:12:45.139
All right? It takes two hours longer.

00:12:45.139 --> 00:12:46.891
- Call Wrigley's.
- You can stretch it

00:12:46.891 --> 00:12:48.851
by cutting bread shorter
and using less gravy.

00:12:48.851 --> 00:12:52.354
Which is not how we've ever done
a beef here in 25 years, Carm.

00:12:52.438 --> 00:12:53.856
System, baby.

00:12:53.856 --> 00:12:57.193
- System.
- You can barely afford to pay people.

00:12:57.193 --> 00:13:00.446
- Don't talk to me about labor.
- I thought this was your house.

00:13:05.284 --> 00:13:06.452
Fuck all this.

00:13:07.244 --> 00:13:09.163
Announcement. Listen up.

00:13:09.163 --> 00:13:13.209
Bread stays the same,
gravy stays the same.

00:13:26.514 --> 00:13:29.642
A buck's not gonna get him
anywhere, Bear. It's too difficult.

00:13:29.642 --> 00:13:32.561
Yeah, Fak, that's the point.
It's ultra-confusing.

00:13:32.645 --> 00:13:35.856
Yeah, homie.
It's a Norwegian knockoff <i>Mortal Kombat.</i>

00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:38.609
Part of the reason this machine
got recalled firstly,

00:13:38.609 --> 00:13:41.111
aside from the excessive
and irresponsible violence

00:13:41.195 --> 00:13:43.739
is it's too difficult.
It's a fighter and a scroller.

00:13:44.657 --> 00:13:47.910
Also, I am sorry.
I didn't make it to the funeral.

00:13:48.577 --> 00:13:51.747
I sent flowers.
And I really hope that they looked nice.

00:13:51.831 --> 00:13:53.958
I wasn't there. How long will this take?

00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:55.042
An hour.

00:13:55.042 --> 00:13:57.962
Make it faster. Can you
open up the windows in the back?

00:13:58.128 --> 00:13:59.797
- Later.
- Carmen, you're bleeding.

00:13:59.922 --> 00:14:02.633
What the... Shit.
Man, stupid dull-ass knife.

00:14:02.633 --> 00:14:05.261
- Corner!
- Fucking dang, Ebraheim.

00:14:05.469 --> 00:14:07.555
- Carmen, your fault. Say "corner."
- Blood!

00:14:07.555 --> 00:14:09.932
You see? Good. Good.

00:14:09.932 --> 00:14:12.434
You all happy now? Can I have my fucking
knife back?

00:14:51.015 --> 00:14:53.767
I swear to God,
she looks fucking beautiful.

00:14:53.851 --> 00:14:55.769
You would have lost your mind.

00:14:55.853 --> 00:14:57.313
That's fire, Chef.

00:14:57.563 --> 00:14:59.523
The guy's back in my face.

00:14:59.607 --> 00:15:03.068
Hey, guys, we got to line up.
We got service in an hour, all right?

00:15:03.152 --> 00:15:04.820
I'm like, "If you'll get in my face,

00:15:04.904 --> 00:15:06.780
-"we will have a real problem."
- Cousin!

00:15:06.864 --> 00:15:08.532
- One second.
- I want to start

00:15:08.616 --> 00:15:10.534
defining our roles more clearly.

00:15:10.618 --> 00:15:13.078
- Hold on a second here.
- Seriously, cousin!

00:15:13.162 --> 00:15:16.206
- We're trying to get some work done.
- Dude from the hot dog stand?

00:15:16.290 --> 00:15:20.419
This is his twin brother, which
I found out later. I found out later.

00:15:20.419 --> 00:15:23.631
But at this point, I think it's the guy
from the hot dog stand.

00:15:23.631 --> 00:15:26.508
- And I'm like, "Listen, go home already.

00:15:26.592 --> 00:15:28.594
"Get the fuck out of here."

00:15:28.594 --> 00:15:31.013
Oh, my God. I'm like...

00:15:31.180 --> 00:15:34.558
So I'm like, "Okay, now there's
a problem. I'm trying to enjoy my tacos.

00:15:34.642 --> 00:15:36.101
"You're ruining my date." Right?

00:15:36.185 --> 00:15:38.479
So this guy, he pulls out a revolver.

00:15:38.479 --> 00:15:39.563
No. Swear to God.

00:15:39.647 --> 00:15:42.107
And I'm like, "Oh, my God,
where did you get that?

00:15:42.191 --> 00:15:44.485
"Did you steal that
from the museum gift shop?"

00:15:45.277 --> 00:15:49.073
Like, "Who are you? Mr. Bogart?"
Please, what are we doing here?

00:16:11.595 --> 00:16:13.222
Hey, Tina. I got to go see my sister.

00:16:13.222 --> 00:16:14.932
- Hold down the fort?
- Yeah, sure.

00:16:14.932 --> 00:16:16.100
- Listen, Jeff.
- Yeah.

00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:18.018
How come your sister don't come by here?

00:16:18.102 --> 00:16:19.353
You got to ask her.

00:16:23.148 --> 00:16:24.358
- Hi.
- Yo.

00:16:24.358 --> 00:16:25.985
You didn't put it in a bag?

00:16:27.152 --> 00:16:28.529
That's how you say hello to me?

00:16:29.113 --> 00:16:30.739
- Hi.
- Hi...

00:16:41.208 --> 00:16:42.626
You smell like this place.

00:16:44.003 --> 00:16:45.004
Sorry.

00:16:46.380 --> 00:16:49.425
I'm sorry, I just hate seeing you here.

00:16:51.093 --> 00:16:52.094
Yeah, well...

00:16:57.307 --> 00:16:58.517
These labels...

00:16:58.517 --> 00:16:59.852
- Marcus.
- What?

00:16:59.852 --> 00:17:02.354
Where are the chili flakes?
Most Polish shit ever.

00:17:02.438 --> 00:17:05.065
- Cousin organizes, it's more confusing.
- Right there.

00:17:05.149 --> 00:17:06.442
Labeled "chili flakes."

00:17:10.446 --> 00:17:12.489
What does Sweeps stand for?

00:17:12.781 --> 00:17:17.578 line:20%
I swept St. Louis three times.
My real last name is Woods.

00:17:34.595 --> 00:17:36.096
You text Mom?

00:17:36.180 --> 00:17:37.556
No. Uh...

00:17:37.556 --> 00:17:40.559
- You know she'd love to see you.
- No, I know. I just...

00:17:51.361 --> 00:17:53.906
I've been trying to call you.
You haven't called me back.

00:17:53.906 --> 00:17:56.700
Yeah. No, I know. I've been busy.
I've been working, so...

00:17:57.242 --> 00:17:58.869
Uncle Jeremy wants to buy this place.

00:17:58.869 --> 00:18:00.871
- It's not for sale.
- I wanted to tell you.

00:18:00.871 --> 00:18:01.955
That it's not for sale?

00:18:02.039 --> 00:18:03.290
No, we should sell it to him.

00:18:03.290 --> 00:18:05.375
So he could flip it
into an Applebee's? No.

00:18:05.459 --> 00:18:08.170
I'm trying to do something here, Sugar.

00:18:08.170 --> 00:18:10.798
Okay. I was so excited
for you to come home.

00:18:14.009 --> 00:18:15.010
Got to go. Um...

00:18:16.261 --> 00:18:17.304
Okay.

00:18:19.389 --> 00:18:20.390
I'm okay.

00:18:22.267 --> 00:18:23.727
- Okay?
- Okay.

00:18:26.021 --> 00:18:27.356
I'm gonna fix this place.

00:18:29.775 --> 00:18:31.026
No one's asking you to.

00:18:36.448 --> 00:18:38.742
- I really... I gotta go. Okay?
- Bear.

00:18:38.826 --> 00:18:40.202
- Yeah?
- I love you.

00:18:42.079 --> 00:18:43.122
Thank you for this.

00:18:47.167 --> 00:18:48.252
You're welcome.

00:18:56.635 --> 00:18:57.719
Welcome back.

00:19:02.641 --> 00:19:05.018
Time to try the new sandwiches. Behind.

00:19:05.477 --> 00:19:06.687
Corner.

00:19:09.356 --> 00:19:10.732
Marcus, rolls please, Chef.

00:19:12.151 --> 00:19:13.485
Fuck. Again.

00:19:16.488 --> 00:19:18.699
- That's crumbly. Too dense.
- Doing it by hand.

00:19:18.699 --> 00:19:19.908
- Yeah.
- It's the mixer.

00:19:19.992 --> 00:19:22.494
It's not the mixer.
It's crumbly. The oven's too dry.

00:19:22.578 --> 00:19:23.954
Fill a baking sheet with water,

00:19:23.954 --> 00:19:25.914
put it on the oven floor.
Make another batch.

00:19:25.998 --> 00:19:28.041
- Don't tell me how to do my job.
- Just do it.

00:19:30.711 --> 00:19:31.879
Yo.

00:19:31.879 --> 00:19:33.881
Somebody come try this. Cousin.

00:19:35.757 --> 00:19:36.967
Here you go, Chef.

00:19:37.676 --> 00:19:38.677
Chef.

00:19:40.053 --> 00:19:41.346
Go on. What do you think?

00:19:41.430 --> 00:19:42.973
It's redundant and white, just like you.

00:19:42.973 --> 00:19:44.057
Heard.

00:19:44.141 --> 00:19:45.976
- Tina, salt? Meat?
- Mmm.

00:19:46.185 --> 00:19:49.104
- It's tender? It's nice? You happy?
- Very good, <i>puta.</i>

00:19:49.605 --> 00:19:51.106
All right.

00:19:51.899 --> 00:19:53.442
Yo, Sydney.

00:19:53.775 --> 00:19:54.985
Try this business.

00:19:58.155 --> 00:19:59.823
- Oh, fuck.
- Mmm-hmm.

00:19:59.907 --> 00:20:00.908
You know that's fire.

00:20:00.908 --> 00:20:02.659
- Yeah. Fucking fire.
- Mmm-hmm.

00:20:02.743 --> 00:20:04.494
So how you gonna pass the family test?

00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:06.330
Delicious or impressive?

00:20:07.706 --> 00:20:08.916
Delicious is impressive.

00:20:09.583 --> 00:20:10.584
Word.

00:20:17.049 --> 00:20:18.592
That dude looks like a carrot.

00:20:18.717 --> 00:20:20.260
Is that a fucking carrot?

00:20:20.344 --> 00:20:21.511
It's clearly a carrot.

00:20:21.595 --> 00:20:23.513
Do you not know
what a carrot looks like?

00:20:23.639 --> 00:20:25.057
We're gonna need more bread.

00:20:28.518 --> 00:20:31.647
It's all good until it
starts making this weird sound.

00:20:31.647 --> 00:20:34.024
That's a classic sound,
with these pieces of shit.

00:20:34.149 --> 00:20:35.651
Hey, did you know Michael?

00:20:35.651 --> 00:20:37.611
He was like one of my best friends.

00:20:37.611 --> 00:20:39.696
- But then it got dark at the end.
- Corner.

00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:41.114
How are we on that bread?

00:20:41.198 --> 00:20:43.116
- Coming out soon.
- Okay, watch your back.

00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:45.035
Hey, Chi-Chi. Come get your jacket.

00:20:45.035 --> 00:20:46.495
Yo, Fak, how we looking?

00:20:46.495 --> 00:20:48.413
I'm gonna be able to fix this, dude.

00:20:48.497 --> 00:20:50.666
- Do you have any stale bread?
- Above the oven.

00:20:50.666 --> 00:20:53.335
- Corner.
- Corner. Behind.

00:20:53.335 --> 00:20:54.795
- Corner.
- Fak, move out.

00:20:54.795 --> 00:20:57.422
- I'll pay you in sandwich, yeah?
- Deal.

00:20:57.506 --> 00:20:59.299
- No shit deal.
- Fuck off, man.

00:20:59.383 --> 00:21:01.009
Was Richie always an asshole?

00:21:01.093 --> 00:21:03.220
Always and forever, dude.
He's the worst.

00:21:03.220 --> 00:21:05.305
- Yeah, he sucks.
- He's not a nice guy.

00:21:05.389 --> 00:21:06.974
- He's sad inside.
- Yeah.

00:21:07.724 --> 00:21:08.809
Fak.

00:21:09.851 --> 00:21:10.852
Dude.

00:21:18.652 --> 00:21:20.195
Yo. Family's up.

00:21:20.279 --> 00:21:22.656
Yeah. Let's do this.

00:21:23.865 --> 00:21:25.492
Oh, my God. Smelling fab.

00:21:25.492 --> 00:21:27.744
- That looks so good.
- Damn, Sydney.

00:21:28.161 --> 00:21:29.288
Let's go.

00:21:29.288 --> 00:21:31.498
Yeah.

00:21:31.832 --> 00:21:33.959
Okay. What we got going on over here?

00:21:33.959 --> 00:21:38.088
Yeah, we got a stew, rice,
plantains, and a little fennel salad.

00:21:38.505 --> 00:21:40.590
All right,
I'm interested, let's do this.

00:21:41.883 --> 00:21:43.760
I bring my own.
This look like shit.

00:21:44.136 --> 00:21:45.804
- Come on.

00:21:47.431 --> 00:21:48.432
I don't eat pork.

00:21:48.557 --> 00:21:50.809
- It's not pork, it's beef.
- He'll have what he'll have.

00:21:50.809 --> 00:21:52.519
- It looked like pork.

00:21:52.519 --> 00:21:54.021
- Okay.
- All right, I'll start.

00:21:54.021 --> 00:21:57.649
I'm grateful for Philip K. Dick.
Fak, you're up.

00:21:57.733 --> 00:22:02.529
Me? I'm... thankful for my cats, Ralph.

00:22:03.947 --> 00:22:05.115
They both named Ralph?

00:22:05.115 --> 00:22:07.367
Yeah, it's just...
Like, it's easier that way.

00:22:07.451 --> 00:22:09.661
- Ralph and Ralph.
- All right, Tina, you're up.

00:22:09.745 --> 00:22:10.746
What's up?

00:22:10.746 --> 00:22:12.789
I'm grateful for all of you, my friend.

00:22:13.874 --> 00:22:14.875
Look at you, softy.

00:22:15.584 --> 00:22:18.837
I guess I'm grateful
that Richie didn't come in here

00:22:18.837 --> 00:22:21.089
wearing that cologne
that he always be wearing.

00:22:21.173 --> 00:22:23.467
You know,
it smells like a pine tree and shit.

00:22:24.926 --> 00:22:27.262
Smell like onion under arm.

00:22:29.806 --> 00:22:31.141
Onion under arm.

00:22:32.059 --> 00:22:33.518
Chef, you want a plate?

00:22:33.602 --> 00:22:34.895
All good. Thank you, Chef.

00:22:34.895 --> 00:22:36.980
You can have mine
if you change your mind.

00:22:37.773 --> 00:22:40.901
What? I just never had <i>platanos</i>
with like grass on it.

00:22:41.902 --> 00:22:44.529
Cousin, cousin, cousin.
Yo, it's getting crazy out there.

00:22:44.613 --> 00:22:46.448
- Come, give me a hand.
- No, bro.

00:22:46.448 --> 00:22:47.532
This is on you.

00:22:47.616 --> 00:22:49.659
Tina, how about these <i>platanos,</i> right?

00:22:49.743 --> 00:22:51.370
- Yo, really?
- Yeah, really.

00:22:51.370 --> 00:22:53.163
You're seizing my house, remember?

00:22:53.163 --> 00:22:54.873
I didn't say I didn't like them.

00:22:54.873 --> 00:22:56.833
She was just saying
she was gonna share it.

00:22:56.917 --> 00:22:58.627
You didn't eat them.

00:22:58.877 --> 00:23:00.837
Yo! Hey!

00:23:00.962 --> 00:23:03.090
Everybody relax.
Stop hitting on the fucking glass.

00:23:04.007 --> 00:23:05.217
Yo.

00:23:05.217 --> 00:23:06.885
Hey, stop banging on the fucking glass

00:23:06.885 --> 00:23:09.221
- Stop hitting.
- You don't need to fucking say.

00:23:24.403 --> 00:23:26.029
<i>Merry Christmas, lizards.</i>

00:23:27.114 --> 00:23:29.282

weird, or do any of that spectral shit.</i>

Cousin, how fucking dope is that?

00:24:50.071 --> 00:24:51.448
- Not dope at all.
- What?

00:24:51.448 --> 00:24:53.283
I brought that crowd and that's money.

00:24:53.283 --> 00:24:56.036
We're not prepped for.
Should've let those turkeys eat you.

00:24:56.036 --> 00:24:59.206
I swear to God, today was not the day
to go fucking with the system.

00:24:59.206 --> 00:25:01.791
- System, system. Cousin...
- I don't care.

00:25:01.875 --> 00:25:03.793
I do not care what you do up in Napa

00:25:03.877 --> 00:25:05.962
with your fucking tweezers
and your foie gras.

00:25:06.046 --> 00:25:08.507
You've got no fucking idea
what you're doing here.

00:25:09.341 --> 00:25:11.092
None. Zero.

00:25:12.135 --> 00:25:13.762
So we'll stick with what works.

00:25:13.762 --> 00:25:15.472
And we are gonna fucking make sure

00:25:15.472 --> 00:25:18.141

00:25:19.601 --> 00:25:24.481
So get your ass back in there
and you make that fucking spaghetti.

00:25:27.859 --> 00:25:30.362
Sydney, sorry about the gun, babe.

00:25:30.362 --> 00:25:31.696
I had to get real.

00:26:04.771 --> 00:26:05.772
God damn.

00:26:06.606 --> 00:26:07.691
Yo, Carm, check it.

00:26:09.568 --> 00:26:11.361
That's good. You see that difference?

00:26:11.361 --> 00:26:12.737
Big time. Steam tray.

00:26:12.821 --> 00:26:14.322
- Yep.
- You were right.

00:26:15.574 --> 00:26:16.658
You could throw down.

00:26:18.076 --> 00:26:19.578
Hey, grab me a fresh parm brick.

00:26:21.871 --> 00:26:22.872
