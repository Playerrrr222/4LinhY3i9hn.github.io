00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:19.631
You know that feeling
when a guy you like

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.640
sends you a text at
two o'clock on a Tuesday night

00:00:21.664 --> 00:00:23.551
asking if he can come and find you

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.016
and you've accidentally made it out
like you've just got in yourself.

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:28.216
So you have to get out of bed,
drink half a bottle of wine

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:31.056
get in the shower, shave everything,
dig out some Agent Provocateur business

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.309
suspender belt, the whole bit

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:34.237
and wait by the door
until the buzzer goes?

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:42.400
And then you open the door to him like
you've almost forgotten he's coming over.

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.395
Oh. Hi.

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:47.000
Hey.

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:50.195
Hey.

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:52.595
Hey.

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:55.717
And then you get to it immediately.

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:07.912
After some pretty standard bouncing

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:13.353
you realise he's edging
towards your arsehole.

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.510
But you're drunk and he made
the effort to come all the way here.

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.915
So you let him. He's thrilled.

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.429
Oh!

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:23.232
I'm so thrilled.

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:34.549
And then the next morning
you wake to find him fully dressed

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.559
sat on the side of the bed,
gazing at you.

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.031
He says that...
- Last night was incredible.

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:50.151
Which you think is an overstatement.

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.271
But then he goes on to say that...

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.553
It was particularly special because
I've never managed to actually...

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.753
up the burn with anyone before.

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.238
To be fair he does have a large penis.

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.351
And although it's always
been a fantasy of mine

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:09.155
I've never found anyone
I could do it with.

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.435
And then he touches your hair.

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.995
And thanks you with a genuine earnest.

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:23.753
Thank you.

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.197
It's sort of moving.

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.390
Then he kisses you gently...

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.758
and then he leaves.

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.231
And you spend the rest
of the day wondering...

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.953
do I have a massive arsehole?

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:35.549
Well, um, this doesn't happen
very often, does it?

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:37.477
- No.

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:39.636
No, I suppose it's...

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:41.751
- It's quite rare, yeah.

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:44.514
I hate myself.

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:47.592
Um, are you going to work?

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:51.270
Er, no actually...
- Okay, um, this is gonna sound crazy

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:53.357
um, but I think that I
should take your number

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:54.720
and I think I should call it

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:58.276
and I think I should ask you if you
wanna go out for a drink with me.

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:01.154
Um...

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.157
Fuck me, you've got a boyfriend.

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:06.670
Er, no. Um, no, we broke up
quite recently actually.

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.792
Oh my God, I'm so sorry,
slash really pleased.

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:13.435
Um, how the hell did he
manage to fuck that up?

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.638
Power rarely gives up without a fight.

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:22.829
Particularly in places where there are
divisions of tribe, divisions of sect.

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:27.916
We also know that populism
can take dangerous turns

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:30.873
and there will be difficult
days along the way.

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:36.072
From the extremism of those who would use
democracy to deny a minority of rights

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:38.960
to the nationalism that...
- What are you doing?

00:04:38.984 --> 00:04:40.258
Nothing.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.559
Harry.

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:48.319
I know what you were doing.
- I was watching the news.

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:51.318
Really?
- Yeah.

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:54.677
Really?
- Yeah.

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:57.233
What was he talking about then?

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:59.032
What?

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:01.754
Please, I just need to hear this.
What was he talking about?

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:05.514
Iraq.

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:14.033
Don't say anything,
and please don't stop me leaving.

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:17.669
Please don't!
- Okay. - Don't!

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:23.913
I've really tried to be
there for you through this.

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:26.190
You can't say I haven't tried.

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:27.560
Don't say anything.

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:29.750
And please don't contact me

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:32.076
or turn up at my house drunk
in your underwear.

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:33.838
It won't work this time.
- It will.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.116
I'm taking that posh shampoo.

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:43.914
He was talking about democ...

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:47.038
Oh, he was just...

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:51.750
really kind
and supportive with my work.

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:54.440
He'd cook all the time,
he'd run baths, hoover.

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:56.391
He'd laugh at all of my jokes.

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:59.034
He was really great with my family
and my friends loved him.

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:00.878
Plus he was really fucking affectionate.

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:08.914
Yeah, he sounds like a dickhead.
- Yeah.

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:12.430
So was that like you can have
my number or whatever you...

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:14.994
Yes. Yeah, I guess it's a yes.

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:17.475
Oh my God. Great. Okay.

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:21.397
Put that in there.

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:25.830
And I'll be sure to treat you
like a nasty little bitch.

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:29.160
Um, that was a joke.

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:31.840
Oh no, I know, I know.
- Yeah, okay. That was like, oh.

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:33.951
Okay. Great. Wow.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.435
I'll buzz you then?

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:38.835
Okay.
- Okay. Okay.

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:44.038
I can't stop smiling. Sorry I...

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:46.513
Oh, okay.

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:06.676
Thank you for coming in today.

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:12.398
We really appreciate you considering us
for your small business start-up loan.

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:14.397
No problem.
- I've read your application form.

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:17.239
Thank you.
- It <i>was... funny.</i>

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:18.350
Oh.

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:21.277
Okay, that wasn't my intention but...

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:23.470
As you are probably aware

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:26.433
we haven't had the opportunity
to support many...

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:28.676
any women-led businesses since the...

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:30.552
Sexual harassment case.

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:34.032
The sexual harassment case, yes.

00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:37.871
Are you alright?
- Oh yeah, sorry.

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:41.231
I just, um, I ran from the
station so I'm just a bit hot.

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:42.759
But I'm really excited about, um...

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:45.030
Water?
- Er, no thanks, I'm fine.

00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:47.080
Actually, yeah,
water would be great, if I could...

00:07:47.104 --> 00:07:48.035
Sure.

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:51.516
There are a couple of details
that we need to iron out

00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:54.996
and one or two bits and pieces
I'm gonna need to see some more on.

00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:58.476
It says in here that you opened
the business with your partner in...

00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:01.515
Okay.

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:05.318
I'm sorry, that kind of thing
won't get you very far here anymore.

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:06.555
Oh no, sorry.

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:08.079
I thought I had a top on underneath.

00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:09.952
Yeah, okay.
- No seriously.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:11.354
In this case, genuine accident.

00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:13.640
I can see given our history
why you might think that's...

00:08:13.664 --> 00:08:15.790
No! Seriously I wasn't
trying to. I was hot.

00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:17.480
I take this kind of thing very seriously.

00:08:17.504 --> 00:08:19.939
I'm not trying to shag you!
Look at yourself!

00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:27.273
Okay.

00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:29.839
Please leave.

00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:31.914
On...

00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:36.031
No, you don't understand.
I need this... I need this loan...

00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:38.151
Please just leave.

00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:52.029
Perv!

00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:54.554
Wow!

00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:07.553
My sister.

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:09.830
She's uptight and beautiful
and probably anorexic

00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:12.315
but clothes look awesome on her so...

00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:14.237
You're almost late.

00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:15.873
Had to do a flash poo in Pret.

00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:17.399
Oh Christ. Did you wash your hands?

00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:18.440
Course not.

00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:22.596
Oh my God! You are disgusting.
Fucking hell.

00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:25.951
Of course I washed my hands.
It's not like a grew up without a mother.

00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:29.640
Heard from dad?

00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:30.829
No.

00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:34.716
Dad's way of coping with
two motherless daughters

00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:36.592
was to buy us tickets to feminist lectures

00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:39.109
start fucking our Godmother
and eventually stop calling.

00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:43.954
You look tired.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.514
Thanks, I've been sleeping
really well recently.

00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:54.314
Shit.

00:09:56.080 --> 00:10:00.790
I'm wearing the top
that she lost years ago.

00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:03.719
So... this is gonna be tense.

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:05.833
Do you want to take your coat off?

00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:07.791
- Okay.

00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:12.831
Oh, I'm so sorry.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:17.320
So, any luck with...

00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:18.976
Oh God, can we just have
two seconds without...

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
I was going to ask how
it was going with the cafe'.

00:10:21.024 --> 00:10:24.224
I know, I just don't wanna talk about it
yet! - Fine, we won't talk then. - Fine.

00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:27.829
Hair looks nice.
- Oh fuck off.

00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:33.749
The only thing harder than having
to tell your super-high-powered

00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:36.792
perfect, anorexic, rich super-sister
that you've run out of money

00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:39.400
is having to ask her to bail you out.

00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:47.631
I'm just gonna ask her.

00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:51.272
I'm just gonna ask her.

00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:53.711
I'm just gonna ask her.
I'm just gonna come...

00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:55.478
Do you need to borrow money?
- No.

00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:58.160
Can't do it, can't do it,
I can't do it. Can't do it.

00:10:58.200 --> 00:10:59.713
Your business is good then?

00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:02.274
Yeah. It's good. It's really good.
It's really, really good.

00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:03.719
Yeah, it's really good.

00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:05.478
Sounds like it's really good.

00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:07.158
It is.

00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:09.480
Hey.

00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:10.590
Hey.

00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:13.794
Can I get you anything?

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:15.160
No thanks, I'm good.

00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:03.597
Are you sure I can't
get you anything at all?

00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:07.110
Is Harry helping?
Er, we broke up.

00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:08.878
What?! Again?

00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:12.072
Mmm. If you see him,
I'm a wreck, okay?

00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:16.478
God, just don't get drunk and
scream through his letterbox again.

00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:18.397
Wow, thanks for the vote of confidence.

00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:20.750
Don't get drunk and
shit in your sink again.

00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:23.076
When are you gonna
stop bringing that up?

00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:25.236
When you do something better!

00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:28.991
I have two degrees, a husband
and a Burberry coat.

00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:31.919
You shat in a sink!

00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:35.112
- Oh. Hi. Thank you. Hi.
- Oh, no problem.

00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:39.600
Nothing is ever going to be better.

00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:47.593
I swear there are pants
that give you thrush.

00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:49.358
What are yours made from?

00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:51.594
I dunno.

00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:55.552
I need to get sexy pants.

00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:58.672
I hate my body, I hate my body,
I hate my body, I hate my body.

00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:03.715
Fucking last minute bastard trendy parties,
why do we do it to ourselves.

00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:10.718
Oh my God, definitely not.
That does nothing for you. I hate that.

00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:13.720
What?

00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:16.314
These are my clothes, Boo,
I've been wearing these all day.

00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:18.793
Oh God.

00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:21.750
Were you wearing your coat?
- Yes.

00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:23.029
But...

00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:26.176
Well, nothing here looked nice so I just
thought I'd wear what I was wearing anyway.

00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:27.713
Are you joking?

00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:29.034
Are you joking?

00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:30.795
Yes.

00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:36.317
Oh my God! Why didn't you tell me!
- It's really not that bad! I love you!

00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:38.397
I've gotta get a whole new outfit now!

00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:42.035
I'll buy you pants, I'll buy you sexy
pants! - I've been so many places today!

00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:44.310
I'll buy you sexy pants!
- Fuck off!

00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:47.591
I'm sorry! I think it's a lovely dress!
- Get out of here!

00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:51.270
Oh, I mean, you really shouldn't
wear such cheap materials.

00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:53.038
They don't let your fanny breathe.

00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:56.920
I know.

00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:08.430
Thank you so much for coming
to Women Speak

00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:11.950
opening women's mouths since 1998.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:16.312
Before we begin,
I would like to ask you a question.

00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:20.911
I don't know about you,
but I need some reassurance.

00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:27.719
So I pose the question
to the women in this room today.

00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:31.793
Please raise your hands

00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:37.594
if you would trade
five years of your life

00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:42.433
for the so-called perfect body.

00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:52.557
We are bad feminists.

00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:56.316
I want my top back.
- Okay.

00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:08.712
Won't you get cold?
- No, I've got really hairy nipples.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:15.070
What?

00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:18.838
Oh!
- Fuck!

00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:20.154
Fuck!
- What was that?!

00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:22.111
Jesus!
- A fucking hug!

00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:23.560
Well, why the fuck did you do that?

00:15:23.584 --> 00:15:25.461
It was terrifying. Never do that again!

00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:27.479
I was just trying to...

00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:37.759
Are you okay?
- Yeah.

00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:45.713
Do you wanna go for a drink or...?
- No, I've got plans.

00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:48.718
Okay, fine. Sure, see you next time
'Women Speak' then.

00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:55.236
Do you wanna go for a drink?

00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:08.071
And my sister blows glass.
She has done for a long time.

00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:09.576
What was I saying,
I've never like been in a fight.

00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:11.856
Well, I've been in a fight. Never been
punched in the face, you know what I mean?

00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:15.032
I've been punched in the leg and someone
once threw some punch in my face.

00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:17.913
So my colours this season
are sort of brown mainly

00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:21.316
but like, you know,
I wouldn't say no to a maroon.

00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:24.671
I wouldn't like jump down the throat of
someone wearing something blue

00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:25.869
it's just not for me.

00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:28.275
So, I'm gonna go for a waz.

00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:30.072
- Yep, okay.

00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:39.997
Same again? While I'm up.
Or perhaps like a little cocky-tail?

00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:41.394
Or like a nice shot?

00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:44.592
Oh, yeah, or we could
just go back to mine.

00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:46.392
Wow. Um, thanks.

00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:50.115
Er, I've actually got work, er, tomorrow,
but, um, another drink here?

00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:52.800
Or we could just go back to yours.
- Gotta be up really early so...

00:16:52.846 --> 00:16:55.726
Well, let's get you a cab in the morning.
- That's ridiculous. I can't...

00:16:55.750 --> 00:16:57.900
- Okay, what the fuck is your problem?

00:16:58.320 --> 00:17:00.755
Oh, um, nothing.

00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:02.837
I, um, I like you.

00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:04.075
Okay, you're a dick.

00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:06.154
What's going on?

00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:09.511
You're pathetic.

00:17:09.560 --> 00:17:12.279
Wait!
- Oh, don't follow me.

00:17:12.320 --> 00:17:13.799
Oh. I wasn't.

00:17:14.320 --> 00:17:16.357
You dropped this.

00:17:21.320 --> 00:17:22.674
Um...

00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:34.510
Hey.

00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:37.879
Come on.

00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:54.113
Are you okay?

00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:03.111
Are you okay?

00:18:04.840 --> 00:18:06.592
Sad face.

00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:09.514
I'm fine.

00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:20.274
Oh.

00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:24.354
You're such a lovely man.

00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:32.040
Okay.
- Thank you.

00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:35.791
Stay there, stay there, you okay?

00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:38.834
Okay. Hey. Hey.

00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:44.120
Do you wanna come home with me?

00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:46.959
What?! No way!

00:18:48.040 --> 00:18:49.792
You naughty boy.

00:18:57.760 --> 00:19:02.072

00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:27.034
Oh fuck it...

00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:31.995
I have a horrible feeling that I'm
a greedy, perverted, selfish

00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:36.830
apathetic, cynical, depraved,
morally bankrupt woman

00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:39.474
who can't even call herself a feminist.

00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:42.997
Well, um...

00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:51.153
you get all that from your mother.

00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:03.838
Good one.

00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:06.474
Er, I'm gonna call you a cab, darling

00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:10.629
and, um, please don't go upstairs.

00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:46.869
To be fair she's not
an evil stepmother.

00:21:46.920 --> 00:21:49.196
She's just a cunt.

00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:52.349
Hi.

00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:55.954
Darling, I thought that must be you.
Everything alright?

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:58.389
Yeah, I just thought I'd swing by.

00:21:58.440 --> 00:22:00.431
Oh, how lovely. Lucky us.

00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:02.915
Oh don't worry,
Dad's already booking me a taxi.

00:22:08.600 --> 00:22:09.749
What you doin'?

00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:11.234
Oh, painting.

00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:14.910
I find the night time's very peaceful...

00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:17.270
Usually.

00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:19.797
Oh, warming up.

00:22:26.360 --> 00:22:28.920
Look, I know it's not really my place,
but are you okay?

00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:31.315
Everyone's been really worried.
- Poor fucker.

00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:37.311
Yes, she's actually an expression of how
women are subtle warriors, strong at heart.

00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:39.920
You know, we don't have to use
muscular force to get what we want

00:22:39.944 --> 00:22:43.699
we just use our...
- Tits. - innate femininity.

00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:47.519
Tits don't get you anywhere
these days. Trust me.

00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:51.591
It's very valuable actually.

00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:53.597
How much?
- Thousands.

00:22:53.640 --> 00:22:55.438
Whoa. Can I have it?

00:22:55.480 --> 00:22:56.959
- No.

00:23:05.240 --> 00:23:06.958
What's that?

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:09.913
Oh, um, my self-portrait.

00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:18.029
Oh.

00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:22.916
- Right, it's here.
- Oh, er, I think I can hear your dad.

00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:27.312
Cab's here!

00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:28.589
Thanks.

00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:29.835
Ah, nice of him.

00:23:31.080 --> 00:23:34.232
Okay. Bye.
- Bye.

00:23:36.040 --> 00:23:41.831
Um, please look after yourself.
You really do look ghastly, darling.

00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:51.397
Oh, a café, eh?

00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:52.669
Yeah.

00:23:53.800 --> 00:23:55.757
On your own?

00:23:56.040 --> 00:23:57.394
Er, kind of.

00:23:58.040 --> 00:24:00.236
Kind of? Go on.

00:24:00.280 --> 00:24:03.193
- It's quite a funny story actually.

00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:06.278
On no, that's good,
it'll keep me going. Shoot.

00:24:08.040 --> 00:24:09.917
I opened the cafe with my friend, Boo.

00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:11.712
Cute name.
- Yeah.

00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:13.592
Yeah, she's dead now.

00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:15.756
She accidentally killed herself.

00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:18.713
It wasn't her intention
but it wasn't a total accident.

00:24:18.760 --> 00:24:20.273
She didn't actually think she'd die

00:24:20.320 --> 00:24:23.711
she just found out that her
boyfriend fucked someone else

00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:26.320
and wanted to punish him
by ending up in hospital

00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:28.590
and not letting him visit her for a bit.

00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:31.154
She decided to walk
into a busy cycle lane

00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:34.352
wanting to get tangled in a bike,
break a finger maybe.

00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:36.994
But as it turns out bikes go fast
and flip you into the road.

00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:39.998
Three people died,
she was such a dick.

00:24:44.920 --> 00:24:47.196
So yeah. Kind of on my own.
