00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.431
I think my period's coming.

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:00.550
OK...

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:01.476
Hi!

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.670
Are you all right?
What's happened? Are you hurt?

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:05.916
- Oh, good.

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:09.999
Nice haircut.
- It's better.

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:13.715
Can I come in?

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:15.478
Why didn't you text?

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.079
Well, I just thought I'd pop by.

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:18.030
Tell the truth.

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:19.229
I need to speak to Martin.

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:20.111
Martin?

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:21.594
Martin. Martin.

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.280
Why on earth would you
want to speak to...

00:01:23.331 --> 00:01:24.651
- Martin?
- Hello!

00:01:24.691 --> 00:01:27.989
Hello! My wife in my study, hello.
Give me two.

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.554
Gangbangs, Asian.
I'd put a tenner on it.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.593
- Finished.

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:35.157
Well, hello, you.

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:38.953
She wants to talk to you
about something.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.798
Oh, well, must be my lucky day.

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.354
You said she only likes
to talk to people she fancies.

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:45.756
Ugh.

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:47.871
Can you leave us?
- Why?

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.434
He's organizing your
surprise birthday party.

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.549
Er... you know, I hate surp... OK.

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:02.390
I have a week to organise that now.

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:03.475
Best of luck.

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:04.669
Nice top.

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.358
Ugh. Thanks.

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.677
Do you deal in sculptures as well as
paintings and papier-méché?

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.030
Depends on the quality of the piece.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.752
Fuck me.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.354
What a pair!

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:22.720
- I know, right?

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.279
Where'd you get this?

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:29.359
Oh, just a...
stole it from a market.

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.233
Oh. It's quite a piece.
Who's the artist?

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:36.153
Just <i>a...</i> market artist.

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:37.200
Huh.

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.559
If I sell it, I take ten percent. Deal?

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:41.749
Deal.

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:44.918
OK. Well, I'll get her
photographed now.

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:47.634
Don't tell Claire, please.

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:48.909
Or what?

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:51.236
Or I'll... I'll...

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.669
You got nothing on me, princess.

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.396
Or I'll tell her you were
watching gangbangs.

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.032
Please don't do that again.

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:05.838
I wasn't, by the way.

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:21.355
Ugh.

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:26.919
Disappointing.

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:30.112
Erm... Where did you get that?

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:31.639
Oh, I brought it with me.

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.432
No, you didn't. Give it back.

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:35.679
Tight.

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:37.358
Patch things up with Harry?

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:40.438
Yeah. We're... engaged, so.

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:41.879
God! What?

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:43.593
No, we're not engaged.

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:46.075
No, he's back at the flat,
packing up all his stuff again.

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.552
Oh. I'm sorry.

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:51.755
He really used to make you laugh.

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:54.677
He also used to say things like...

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:56.552
You're not like other girls.

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:58.750
You can... keep up.

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:03.752
I like Harry. I liked his songs.

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:17.989
I admire how much Harry
commits to our breakups.

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:23.033
I mean, this is a new detail.

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:24.832
But he does usually go the extra mile.

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:27.474
A few times, he's even
cleaned the whole flat.

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:31.710
Oh God, no.

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:34.752
Like it's a crime scene.

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:38.589
I've considered timing a breakup for when
the flat needs a bit of a going over.

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:48.276
I don't think this is working.

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:51.435
What?

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:55.512
But he always leaves...

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:01.754
him.

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:03.359
To come back for.

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:06.233
Got to think about all the people
I can have sex with now.

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:10.396
I'm not obsessed with sex.

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:12.716
I just can't stop thinking about it.

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:15.078
The performance of it

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:17.157
the awkwardness of it

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:19.111
the drama of it.

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:24.714
The moment you realise
someone wants your body.

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:27.917
Not so much the feeling of it.

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:33.038
Probably got about 48 hours
before Harry comes back.

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:37.312
I should get on it.

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:40.470
I took half an hour trying to look nice

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:42.955
and I ended up looking amazing!

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.399
Just one of those days.

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:47.114
Gorgeous, fresh-faced,
new top, little bit sexy

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:48.912
on my way to open my café.

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:50.951
And... Oh God.

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:55.150
Yeah, you check me out, chub-chub,
'cause it's never going to happen.

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:58.599
Oh God, he can't believe
how attractive I am.

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:01.360
Kind of worried I'm going to make
a sex offender out of the poor guy.

00:06:01.384 --> 00:06:03.356
Here we go.
This better be good. Here we go.

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:05.152
- Walk of shame!

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:08.120
- CYCLIST: Oi!

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:23.917
Oh.

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:25.394
Dropped my cucumber.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.070
Just dropped my...

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:39.919
Um... Could I get a
cheese sandwich to go, please?

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:41.189
Sure.

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:49.714
That'll be, um... £12.55, please.

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:51.230
London.

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:53.476
- Thanks.

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:01.233
Why do I recognise her?
Is she famous?

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:07.312
Boo's death hit the papers.

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:11.194
Local café girl gets hit by bike,
and a car, and another bike.

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:14.599
Oh no, she used to work here.
- Oh.

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:19.838
I'm sorry, I don't have any change.

00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:31.352
The next man who walks in here
is getting ridden to death.

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:34.635
,_

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:35.795
Hi.

00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:37.714
Not ideal.

00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:41.833
Um... How are you? Darling?

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:44.355
You busy?

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:45.950
A bit.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:47.798
Well, I won't keep you.

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:53.716
I just wanted to talk about
when you dropped in the other night.

00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:55.194
OK.

00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:58.517
I can't help thinking that I... we...

00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:00.358
Yeah?
- I know that we...

00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:04.549
don't have much
of a chance to...

00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:08.957
Did you take the sculpture?
Did you um...

00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:13.032
take the sculpture?
Did you take it?

00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:17.637
No. What sculpture?

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:20.035
Oh right. Right. Good.

00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:23.389
Good. You said, "No," and that...

00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:27.755
that means I can go.
All right, great.

00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:30.595
Phew.

00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:33.236
Are you happy? Are you healthy?

00:08:33.736 --> 00:08:34.736
Hmm.

00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:40.713
Hey. Do you do, like,
hot organic-y food?

00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:42.433
Of course.

00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:45.151
What would you like?

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:46.793
Um, I like risotto.
- Yeah.

00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:48.592
Sure. Grab a seat.

00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:10.560
Hey.

00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:13.235
Hi.

00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:14.280
Hey.

00:09:14.576 --> 00:09:15.576
Hey.

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:16.954
It's nice to see you.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:18.274
You too.

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:20.073
Fucked me up the arse.

00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:21.440
What are you getting?

00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:23.189
Oh, just these.

00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:25.993
For my tiny, bleeding vagina.

00:09:27.056 --> 00:09:28.056
Hot.

00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:28.797
You?

00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:29.875
Stock cubes.

00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:31.194
Hot.

00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:33.558
Hope it's a light flow.

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:34.670
Oh.

00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:36.233
It never is.

00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:39.315
It never... is.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.719
Listen, you around later?

00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:45.755
Er...

00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:47.120
Yes, fucking yes please, yes.

00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:48.514
Yes.

00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:49.595
Cool.

00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:51.677
Cool. Bye.

00:09:57.280 --> 00:09:58.634
Yes!

00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:01.320
I'm so happy with my body now.

00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:04.269
Like, I don't have to define
myself by how I look

00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:06.152
'cause I've just got
a fucking great body!

00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:06.996
Yeah.

00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:08.856
Yeah! I can like, do other stuff now.

00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:09.836
That's so great!

00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:11.917
Mike wants to start trying for a baby.

00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:12.756
OK?

00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:16.156
No... I can't blow this body
on a baby, Steph.

00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:18.396
I'm going to have to leave him.

00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:21.240
What the fuck?

00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:23.951
Oh, shit.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:25.320
That is not hygienic.

00:10:25.344 --> 00:10:26.520
Sorry.

00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:28.995
Oh, gross! We're leaving now.

00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:31.438
I suppose you should meet Hilary.

00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:32.914
Two years ago, I...

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:36.234
OK, the most important thing is

00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:38.160
if you don't like it,
we can't take it back, OK?

00:10:38.184 --> 00:10:39.184
OK.

00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:42.439
Happy birthday.
I'm sorry, I panicked.

00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:44.915
As long as I can wear it
or eat it, I'm happy.

00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:46.837
You can do both of those things.

00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:50.229
Oh my God! Did you get me a...
What is this?

00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:51.509
I...

00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:53.437
What is...?
- I don't know!

00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:55.391
What is it?
- Something to love?

00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:57.795
She's beautiful!

00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:01.158
Thank you, you idiot.

00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:04.077
Escape artist.

00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:12.993
I don't feel anything about
guinea pigs, they're pointless.

00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:15.475
But Boo took Hilary
very seriously as a gift

00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:19.195
and soon everything
became guinea pig related.

00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:24.593
This is an excellent one.

00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:29.035
Drink?

00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:36.355
Look, I'm sorry about the mess.

00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:37.435
No problem.

00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:38.960
Do you want some
prosciutto with that?

00:11:38.984 --> 00:11:40.054
Mmm.

00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:50.158
He's so reliable.

00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:53.079
Utterly inaccessible
and relentlessly profound.

00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:56.033
All he wants is to get you in the bath
and ask questions like...

00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:57.514
What are you afraid of?

00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:00.716
And you find yourself saying things like...

00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:04.991
I guess, losing
the currency of youth.

00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:11.238
Ask me a question.

00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:14.350
When did you realise
you were so good-looking?

00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:19.269
I knew I was different
when I was about nine.

00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:21.197
But shit got real around 11.

00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:22.833
Shit got real?

00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:26.191
You know. Aunts got weird.

00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:30.912
I have another question.

00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:33.273
OK.

00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:35.358
Do you ever feel lonely?

00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:40.314
Yeah. Of course.

00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:42.389
Do you?

00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:44.319
Never.

00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:50.353
Do you want some pineapple?

00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:54.074
Yeah.

00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:03.478
God! Yeah!

00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:08.640
Oh, they're so small. You are so small!

00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:09.750
What?

00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:11.120
They're so small.

00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:12.230
So...

00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:16.353
Small. God, they are so fucking tiny.

00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:17.754
Yeah, I guess they're...

00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:21.191
God, they're hardly even there!
I mean, what the fuck even are they?

00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:22.913
Bit much.

00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:24.754
Excuse me.

00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:30.634
Oh yeah.

00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:32.954
I'm having a Harry panic.

00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:36.160
Madame Ovary is telling me
to run back to safe place.

00:13:36.202 --> 00:13:37.402
I can make baby in safe place.

00:13:37.426 --> 00:13:38.942
But... got to ride it out.

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:42.675
Mustn't... call... Ha...

00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:50.672
Thanks for coming.

00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:52.834
That's OK.

00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:54.474
Are you OK?

00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:56.670
Your message sounded urgent.

00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:00.235
Were you busy?

00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:01.759
No, I was in the interval...

00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:02.870
Oh cool.
Of Cats.

00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:04.797
OK.
- The musical.

00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:08.117
Was it good?
- Really good actually. Really good.

00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:10.639
Sorry for interrupting.

00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:12.000
No, that's OK.

00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:15.271
I got the feeling it wasn't
going to end well for the cats

00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:19.314
so, I mean, probably good to remember
them like that, before they all...

00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:22.920
Sorry. Are you OK?

00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:25.640
Who were you with?

00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:27.273
A work friend.

00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:29.595
A girl.

00:14:34.760 --> 00:14:36.558
Urn...

00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:42.198
I found this.

00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:49.519
Thanks.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:51.593
I didn't realise I'd left it.

00:14:57.800 --> 00:14:59.359
Why is your hair wet?

00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:02.959
Don't look at me like that.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:04.752
Like what? Like what?

00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:08.077
Look, I don't want
to sound cold or cruel or...

00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:11.440
and I don't want you to think I'm just off
happy at the theater all the time either.

00:15:11.464 --> 00:15:12.395
I'm not.

00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:15.432
But... I'm not going to... I just...

00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:18.430
If this is about us getting
back together, I was serious.

00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:20.596
This time, I'm not just
going to come running back.

00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:22.438
I really just need some time away from...

00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:27.117
I'm so glad you called.

00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:28.992
I'm so glad you picked up.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:31.798
I've missed you.

00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:35.513
I've missed you.

00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:39.476
Oh my gosh, you feel good.

00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:42.837
I wish he'd just fuck me.

00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:44.996
All he wants to do is make love.

00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:48.317
Are you OK?
- Yeah, I'm really good. I'm amazing.

00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:51.277
He's wasting me.

00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:55.473
I was once fucking this guy
who would breathe on every thrust.

00:15:55.520 --> 00:15:57.875
You're so young! You're so young!

00:15:57.920 --> 00:16:00.116
I masturbate about that all the time.

00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:02.717
Masturbate a lot these days.

00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:05.516
Especially when I'm bored.

00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:08.272
Or angry.

00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:09.629
Or upset.

00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:11.034
Can we just...

00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:12.559
Or happy.

00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:16.559
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:18.954
Amazing.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:20.035
Yeah.

00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:23.516
Shall I...
- No, could you just... just stay there.

00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:26.837
Oh, just don't... Yeah, no, don't. Just...

00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:30.038
Yeah, ssh.

00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:32.074
Yeah.

00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:35.359
Yes, just... oh, just...

00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:36.913
Oh God.

00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:01.351
I think we should stop masturbating.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:07.718
No, don't say anything yet.

00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:12.038
I just think it might help us
focus on each other

00:17:12.080 --> 00:17:13.957
you know, be more present.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.196
Really successful couples do it, you know.

00:17:18.136 --> 00:17:19.136
Um...

00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:20.389
I've hidden our vibrators.

00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:21.440
Our?

00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:23.039
I thought it might be fun.

00:17:23.080 --> 00:17:24.275
To find them?

00:17:24.320 --> 00:17:26.357
No. Just to try and not...

00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:28.279
touch ourselves.

00:17:28.320 --> 00:17:33.235
To try and save our touches
for each other.

00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:34.315
What do you think?

00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:36.715
Well, I think you're being really sexy.

00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:37.989
Don't!

00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:39.838
Ooh, I'm joking!

00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:43.750
I never masturbate.
I don't know how.

00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:50.036
Yeah, also, I thought we should
try and surprise each other

00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:51.195
once every day.

00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:53.390
Just a, you know, sweet little something

00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:55.158
just to keep it, you know...

00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:56.713
Are you getting this out of a book?

00:17:56.760 --> 00:17:59.274
I've already planned
your first surprise, so...

00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:03.193
don't eat too much before dinner.

00:18:08.360 --> 00:18:10.033
See you later.

00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:13.839
And I will see you later, too.

00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:24.355
Oh!

00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:25.869
Hi.

00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:28.594
Just thought I'd pop by for some lunch.

00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:29.914
Bit weird.

00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:31.917
Yes. Well.

00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:37.678
How are you? Quiet day?

00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:40.951
Yeah, I'm fine.
You OK? You look stressed.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.116
Well, I'm successful, so.

00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:46.114
Do you have rye bread?

00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:49.391
Er, no. But I have some normal bread
you can puke up after.

00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:51.234
Great.

00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:53.469
What do you want on it?

00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:54.669
Oh, just tomatoes is fine.

00:18:55.600 --> 00:18:57.159
Just tomatoes?

00:18:57.200 --> 00:18:58.952
Just a tomato sandwich?

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:01.150
Yes. There a problem?

00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:02.349
No.

00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:06.960
Listen, I don't want to know
anything about this surprise party.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:11.995
But if you could just... have it at mine,
this Friday at 7.30, that'd be great.

00:19:12.040 --> 00:19:16.398
I can organise it and act surprised,
but if you could just...

00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:18.829
Do you know what?
Why don't I just do it?

00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:21.838
I can organise it,
do the food, act surprised

00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:23.837
and just... take it off your hands.

00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:25.440
I mean, I can see that you're busy, so.

00:19:25.464 --> 00:19:26.794
OK. If you want.

00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:30.515
Well, I don't want to, but I think it'd be
easier for everyone if I could just...

00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:31.630
OK.

00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:35.594
I mean, I've done it. It's done.
It's this Friday at 7.30, at mine.

00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:37.880
Great.

00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:46.712
How behind are you?
If it's money that you need...

00:19:46.760 --> 00:19:48.080
I don't need money.

00:19:48.760 --> 00:19:50.671
That'll be £25, please.

00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:54.429
London.

00:19:56.080 --> 00:19:57.080
Thanks.

00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:01.640
Can't believe that thing's still alive.

00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:05.150
Oh, um... any news on Harry?

00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:06.474
Yeah, we're back together.

00:20:06.520 --> 00:20:08.477
Oh God. I can't keep up.

00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:17.074
Hello?

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:20.479
Harry?

00:20:24.680 --> 00:20:27.593
Oh... Shit!

00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:30.475
Surprise, surprise, surprise...

00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:23.276
Surprise!

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:26.559
It's me! It's me! It's me! It's me!

00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:28.910
Why would you do that?
I thought I was going to get raped!

00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:31.110
I'm sorry! I just...
Baby, I'm sorry.

00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:33.400
I thought you wanted a surprise.
It was a ninja surprise.

00:21:33.424 --> 00:21:35.589
Oh my God, my heart.
I'm shaking so much. Oh my God.

00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:39.514
Oh my God!

00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:41.073
Oh...
- Oh my God.

00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:43.236
OK. It's OK. Are you OK?

00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:44.839
Oh my God.

00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:48.120
Did you have a good day?
- I did, yeah. It was fine, thanks.

00:21:48.144 --> 00:21:50.879
Baby, I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry. I didn't think...

00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:53.639
I didn't think you were
going to react like that. I...

00:21:54.320 --> 00:21:55.469
I'm sorry, it was a joke.

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:57.593
It was a good joke.

00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:01.149
Jesus.

00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:03.157
I thought you'd be later.

00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:04.634
Yeah, I...

00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:05.875
Oh my God!

00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:08.355
Oh, God, sorry, I just...
I think I'm still in shock.

00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:15.079
That was horrible.

00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:16.633
It was a surprise.

00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:19.752
I know. Thank you. It's fine.

00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:23.958
Shall I go and get us some wine?

00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:26.235
OK.

00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:34.920
I know what you look like!
I know what you took!

00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:36.837
That is the last time!

00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:41.869
Splashed out on a
special bottle for a special...

00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:46.555
Harry?

00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:50.399
Had to go into the history
on my computer

00:22:50.440 --> 00:22:53.831
to find something I'd seen on the
H&amp;M website this morning, and...

00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:58.279
I don't want to point fingers, but...

00:22:58.320 --> 00:23:03.633
anal, gangbang, mature,
big cock, small tits

00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:09.517
hentai, Asian, teen, MILF,
big butts, lesbian, gay

00:23:09.560 --> 00:23:12.791
facial, fetish, bukakke, young and old

00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:17.073
swallow, rough, voyeur, and public.

00:23:22.520 --> 00:23:24.636
Why are you being so sexy?

00:23:25.880 --> 00:23:27.871
Don't make me hate you.

00:23:28.520 --> 00:23:30.591
Loving you is painful enough.

00:23:33.880 --> 00:23:35.553
OK, sorry.

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:39.150
But I really think you should
write that down.

00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:41.496
I know it's not appropriate, but I really
think you should write that down.

00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:43.920
It's really good for a line.
- I'm not going to write down...

00:23:43.969 --> 00:23:45.769
No, no, I'm serious!
For your songs and stuff.

00:23:45.793 --> 00:23:48.660
It's perfect.
It's poetic, yet real. Serious.

00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:02.433
Don't make me...

00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:04.710
Hate you.
- Yeah, I know! Thank you!

00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:08.993
Loving you is painful...

00:24:11.280 --> 00:24:13.032
What am I doing?

00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:16.920
There's someone at work who loves me.

00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:19.560
Well, she told me she loves me,
and I said we couldn't be together

00:24:19.584 --> 00:24:21.461
because I had to know.

00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:24.313
Do you want to be alone?

00:24:28.520 --> 00:24:30.113
You will never see me again.

00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:35.431
I'll always love you,
but I just can't take it anymore.

00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:39.032
I don't hate you, I'm scared for you.

00:24:41.320 --> 00:24:43.038
He's going to write that down.

00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:53.792
I don't hate you... scared.

00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:04.875
I'm going to go pack my things up
from the bedroom again. But...

00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:07.672
I'm not going to clean.

00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:10.109
It's still in pretty good shape, so.

00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:15.596
If I don't see you after that, goodbye.

00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:26.920
Forever.

00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:34.954
He'll be back.
