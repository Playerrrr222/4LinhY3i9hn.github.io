00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.436
You cannot know this.
No one can hold a map in their head.

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:07.994
I can. It's three turnings away.

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:09.439
You're so gonna get this wrong.

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:11.999
Stop it!
- What?

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:13.400
I can feel you judging my driving.

00:00:13.424 --> 00:00:15.859
I'm not judging your driving.

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:17.949
Let go of the handle then.

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:21.040
Oh, we were supposed
to go down that turning.

00:00:21.064 --> 00:00:22.035
What?
- Yeah.

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.390
You said three turnings.
- Yeah, well, I missed one.

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:27.876
<i>Just use your phone,
you have a sat-new on your phone.</i>

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:30.753
Oh my God, there...
Mindful - oh God - Farm.

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.757
There it is.
We're going the right way.

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.598
I was right.

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.392
I was right.

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.871
Do you know what the lesbian app
for Grindr is called?

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:47.280
Twat-nav.

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:52.878
Don't make this fun.

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.671
It's OK. I'm fucking OK. I'm excellent.

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:06.952
I know I seem mental but I'm fine.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.115
OK.

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:09.594
I just...

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:11.790
I just sometimes need...

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:13.990
need you not to...
- To take the piss.

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.997
Don't finish my sentences!

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:18.237
Take the piss...
- Out of you and your...

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.318
You don't always know
what I'm going to say, OK?

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.316
Sorry.

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:23.395
Out of...

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:25.511
Out of her when she's driving.

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.070
Me while I'm driving.

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.038
Sorry.

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:36.310
Is it at... at home
or... work, or Martin, or...?

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.112
I'm fine. It's fine.

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.159
Martin's being lovely.

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:42.120
Really?

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:43.834
It's fine.

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.519
I'm OK.

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:57.192
Fucking psycho!

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.159
Wow!
Dad really splashed out this time.

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.316
He must be about to do something awful.

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.192
No, it's just Mother's Day.

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:09.310
Oh.

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.717
Happy Mother's Day.

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.391
We're not supposed to
bond on this are we?

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.520
'Cause I really don't think
that's going to end well.

00:02:17.544 --> 00:02:22.061
We're not supposed to talk at all.
It's a silent retreat - God help us.

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.717
How's everything at the cafe, are you...'?

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:27.592
You really don't have to.
- Pfft, thank you.

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.799
In. I 9.2me Qooa 30350.
I _u_lm&gt;m&gt;on Im__o_ sozo.

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:44.949
Come on.

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.110
They're probably gonna
think we're a couple.

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.630
The fact that your mind even
goes there is beyond disturbing.

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.354
Hey! We'd make
a really cute couple.

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:58.354
Sluts!

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.593
Yes?

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.114
We're gonna die here.

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.436
We're gonna be raped and die.

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:08.992
Every cloud...

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.999
Oh, just open the fucking door.

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.395
It's been fucking forev...

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:17.230
Welcome.

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.191
Thank you so much.
- Yeah.

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:21.709
- It's really wonderful.
- Really beautiful grounds.

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:23.160
Extraordinary energy, yeah.

00:03:23.184 --> 00:03:25.919
I see you've been gifted this retreat.

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:27.917
How lucky you both are.

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:33.160
I hope after this weekend
you will feel... rested, inspired...

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:34.998
<i>Do you have Wi-F'V?
- No.</i>

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.590
Would you like
two single beds or a double?

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:40.631
A double, please.
- Two singles.

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.996
Actually, do you have
a separate room?

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:47.795
I'm afraid not. Everyone has to share here,
it's part of the communal...

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:50.514
Singles then. Do you get
newspapers in the morning?

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.440
No, we try to keep the outside world
on the outside during your stay here.

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:58.155
You'll appreciate it in the end,
I promise.

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.077
So, here is your key.

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:01.394
Thank you.

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:02.794
Hope you have a restful weekend.

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:04.353
You too.

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:09.313
Wow, no papers.

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:11.237
You don't read the news.

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:12.949
Yes, I do.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.513
What happened yesterday?

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:17.799
Sting wore white jeans,
and a puppy got stuck in a fan.

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:19.799
Big day.

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.510
What's that for?
- My neck and chest.

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:28.914
What's that for?
- My legs and knees.

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.835
What's that for?
- Ends of my hair.

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:34.713
What's that?
- For my under-eyes.

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:37.513
What's that?
- That is for my face and body.

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:41.356
What would you do
if someone stole all of those?

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:42.993
I'd kill myself.

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:45.350
Why are there no plug sockets in here?

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:47.516
Don't touch my stuff.

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:50.396
What are these for?
- Nothing.

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:51.715
Mm-hmm...

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:53.080
What?

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:54.793
Well, it's just...

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:56.797
Why would you bring such tiny batteries?

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:59.433
I'm just prepared.

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:01.592
Just I've only ever...

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:03.836
seen them used for remote controls...
- Yes, well...

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:05.120
or alarm clocks.
- Yes, alright.

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:06.753
And vibrators.
- Yes! Alright!

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:09.630
You didn't have to ask for a separate room.

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:10.795
What?

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:12.880
If you wanna have a wank,
I can give you some space.

00:05:12.904 --> 00:05:14.234
Oh my God!

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:15.736
No, it's just if you wanna take ten minutes

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:18.360
I'll just go into the bathroom
and moisturise my wrists for a bit.

00:05:18.384 --> 00:05:19.389
You are so immature.

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:20.794
Oh, give it a minute.

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:22.592
Oh, God!

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:25.598
Seriously?
What is wrong with your insides?

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:28.109
Why did you bring the tiny batteries?

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.399
A-ha!

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:40.678
You're a genius!

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:42.996
Always know where the reserves are.

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:45.556
Let go of your past.

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:47.874
Bit on the nose.

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:49.877
Now is the time to let it go

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:51.479
open up your senses

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:54.956
close your mouth and live now.

00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:00.837
Welcome to the female-only
Breath of Silence Retreat.

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:02.996
'Women don't speak'.

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:07.309
Erm... Sorry, I think I'm meant to be at...

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:09.829
Fucking sluts!
- That one.

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:13.835
Shame.

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:19.633
Yes, the first major consideration
is why are you here?

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:22.954
Can anyone here answer that question?

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.311
I want to shut the noise out
and reconnect to my inner thoughts

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:28.749
on the road to feeling
more at one with myself.

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:30.711
Excellent attitude.

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:33.790
Well, you're in the right place.

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:37.720
This weekend is about being mindful.

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:40.718
It's about leaving
your voice in your head

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:43.953
and trapping your thoughts
in your skull.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.675
Think of it as <i>a...</i>
thought prison in your mind.

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:51.711
Firstly, we're going
to teach you how to breathe.

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:54.720
Then we will have a short meditation.

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:59.072
Then we will find our sanctuary
in the partaking of menial tasks

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:02.238
all in perfect silence.

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:05.840
Principle rules are no talking.

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:09.510
If you need to communicate
with any of our other superiors

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:11.756
you can write on that board.

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:14.789
Under no other circumstances
must you communicate

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:16.274
even with each other.

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:21.471
Oh, what if there's an emergency?
- Thank you all for coming here today.

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:25.957
No matter what happens,
a word must not be heard.

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:49.959
Ssh!

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:52.554
Slut!

00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:36.037
Fucking bitch! Fucking piece of shit.

00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:52.717
Back here, back here, back here,
back to me, back to me.

00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:55.434
Alright, now wherever it's come from

00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:58.677
your upbringing,
your experiences with women

00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:02.111
now is the time to turn that around

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:06.950
to reprogramme your mind,
your body and your mouth

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:11.949
to be the better man.

00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:14.879
Alright?

00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:18.675
So, this is Patricia.

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:21.237
Yeah? She's a friend.

00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:25.160
Now Patricia, has just earned
a promotion at work

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:27.191
beating over six other candidates.

00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:30.631
She's the youngest person
to ever achieve this role.

00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:35.549
What should we not say
when we meet her?

00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:38.275
Clever little munchkin?
- Excellent.

00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:40.436
Who'd you blow to get that job?
- OK.

00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:43.916
Slut! You fucking stupid slut!
- OK.

00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:45.919
OK.

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:49.237
What should we say to her?

00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:52.749
<i>Hmm?</i>

00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:56.878
Well done, Patricia.

00:09:57.560 --> 00:10:01.235
Very good. Well done, Patricia.

00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:02.875
Please leave.

00:10:04.096 --> 00:10:05.096
Perv.

00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:05.916
Slut.

00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:07.314
Wow!

00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:09.920
Well done, Patricia.

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:14.993
Guys, it's OK. Keith, can you just...

00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:17.998
Oh my God.
Excuse me, miss, you can't be here.

00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:19.110
OK.

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:23.279
You really can't be here.
It's for your own good... please.

00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:29.674
And now hands up.

00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:33.629
Mirror your palms.

00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:38.673
Look each other in the eye and...

00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:40.635
touch.

00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:45.878
Literally her worst nightmare.

00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:50.278
Ergh.

00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:57.956
Are you alright?

00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:00.754
Talk to me.

00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:02.154
It's nothing.

00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:07.749
God... I can't feel my feet.

00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:11.755
Do you remember
we used to go top-to-toe?

00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:13.598
Ah, kids are so weird.

00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:15.039
We used to do that all the time.

00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:18.118
Yeah, when we were ten and cute,
now we're 30 and angry.

00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:19.594
God, I'm not suggesting that we...

00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:21.153
Just don't, OK?

00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:32.756
Stop stealing my things.

00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:34.871
I'm just checking it's working.

00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:36.991
Oh, it's working, it's definitely working.

00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:40.318
- WOMAN: Ssh!

00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:48.960
Have fun.

00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:57.599
It's actually a really thoughtful
present. Thank you.

00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:02.034
And Martin, getting me that sculpture...

00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:05.439
He must have bent over backwards
to get something like that.

00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:09.797
I feel very lucky.

00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:15.478
I have to tell you something.

00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:18.034
What?

00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:24.991
I stole that sculpture
from a certain somebody's studio

00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:26.872
and then I tried to sell it through Martin

00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:29.036
but Martin took it and gave it to you.

00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:32.198
Just don't put it pride of place
when Dad...

00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:35.232
Well, when they come over.
OK? Because...

00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:36.999
Right.

00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:44.274
Claire...

00:12:45.296 --> 00:12:46.296
Claire?

00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:48.516
Ssh. Go to sleep.

00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:53.919
Shit.

00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:13.197
The sooner we get up...
- Argh!

00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:20.432
The sooner we get on with it,
the sooner we are out of here.

00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:22.710
That's a really nice outfit.

00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:23.955
Thanks.

00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:31.115
Delve into your past.

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:34.994
Think of something
you can't let go of...

00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:38.319
a moment of noise.

00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:41.997
A moment of tension.

00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:48.639
Not for now.

00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:53.277
Now... a moment
when you were peaceful.

00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:58.399
If you could change anything
in the whole world, what would it be?

00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:00.238
My thighs.

00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:02.831
The whole world?

00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:04.951
Oh, don't tell anyone I said that.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:06.035
You?

00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:09.150
I've always been insecure
about my face...

00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:10.315
you know that.

00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:11.953
I know. You shouldn't.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:13.877
Nah, thank you but... hmm.

00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:16.434
No, seriously, there's
nothing wrong with your nose.

00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:19.440
I mean, there's nothing wrong...

00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:21.160
Say that again.
- I mean there's nothing...

00:14:21.184 --> 00:14:22.791
What?
- I don't know...

00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:24.114
_ Argh!
Oh my God!

00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:26.037
I always say the wrong thing!

00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:37.234
Hot.

00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:48.200
What is this?

00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:50.277
I don't even do this in my own home.

00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:51.799
Oh, it's very simple.

00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:54.878
We've paid them to let us
clean their house in silence.

00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:03.040
Jesus!

00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:08.239
I don't want to come
down on you like a school teacher

00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:13.195
but I'm afraid your flagrant lack of
respect for the one rule that we have here

00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:16.471
is now affecting the
other students... Er, clients.

00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:17.954
Inmates?
- Cleaners?

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:19.229
Participants!

00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:22.754
Do you have a problem
with the programme?

00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:29.394
I suggest you try sitting here
in silence for the next hour.

00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:34.310
It will benefit you.
I swear by my soul it will.

00:15:57.400 --> 00:15:59.038
I went through your bag.

00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:01.029
What?

00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:02.435
I couldn't find anything
so you're just gonna

00:16:02.447 --> 00:16:04.047
have to tell me what's
going on with you.

00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:07.353
Talk... or I will scream.

00:16:10.680 --> 00:16:12.671
I got the Finland promotion.

00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:14.154
What Finland promotion?

00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:17.016
How can you ask that? I've told you...
- Oh my God, I'm totally... I know, I know!

00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:19.156
The Finland promotion, that's amazing.
- Thank you.

00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:20.800
Would that mean
you're a millionaire now?

00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:21.671
Handy.

00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:23.631
Don't be ridiculous.

00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:25.275
Yes, it would.

00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:28.273
Well, money makes you cry?

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:30.752
I'm turning it down.

00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:33.633
What? Why?

00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:35.159
Martin.

00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:36.998
Martin says it would be unfair on Jake.

00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:41.110
Jake's her stepson, he's really weird -

00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:43.629
probably clinically,
but no one really talks about that.

00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:46.149
He freaks out if she's gone
for longer than a day.

00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:49.158
And he's got this thing about
trying to get in the bath with her.

00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:56.872
No, no... No, Jake... No!

00:16:56.920 --> 00:16:58.638
He's fifteen.

00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:02.278
He's not your son.
- That's not the point.

00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:04.596
Go!
- I knew you'd say that.

00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:06.278
This is what you've always wanted.

00:17:06.320 --> 00:17:07.320
I know.

00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:09.033
No more power-suits,
fuck load of snow...

00:17:09.080 --> 00:17:09.876
I know.

00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:12.150
Perfect place for your cold, cold heart.

00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:15.192
I know! I can't, I have responsibilities.

00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:17.072
Oh, come on...

00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:19.839
Don't let other people get in the way
of what you really want.

00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:22.633
Finland is what you really want.

00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:27.595
My husband isn't other people, OK?
My husband is my life.

00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:31.349
Your husband tried to kiss me
on your birthday.

00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:36.269
Did he?

00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:42.873
Did he?

00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:14.671
Sluts!

00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:20.831
Sluts!

00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:28.153
Sluts!

00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:35.189
Sluts!

00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:42.356
Slut!

00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:50.709
Lovely, lovely.

00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:53.355
OK.

00:18:54.280 --> 00:18:57.830
Up on your feet.
We're gonna say 'sorry Patricia'.

00:18:58.240 --> 00:18:59.913
Sorry Patricia.

00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:02.880
Lovely, give yourselves
a round of applause.

00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:07.919
Alright guys, well done. We're gonna
head back to that house...

00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:13.116
better men, yeah?
Well done. Good work. Great stuff.

00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:32.911
Go on... you can do it... you're ready.

00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:38.720
Yeah.

00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:40.589
I thought I recognised you.

00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:46.600
Fair enough.

00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:49.674
Probably for the best.

00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:55.672
So is your business...

00:19:57.400 --> 00:19:58.515
surviving?

00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:04.120
I'm sorry.

00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:07.319
Oh, I don't want that.

00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:14.554
So you're doing the whole
silent escape thing?

00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:17.520
Indeed.

00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:20.280
Going well?

00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:30.437
I touched a colleague's breast

00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:32.870
more than once

00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:35.150
at a party, I...

00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:40.318
They asked me to go on a workshop to...

00:20:41.320 --> 00:20:42.320
huh.

00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:45.549
I'm just a very...

00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:49.073
disappointing man.

00:20:56.560 --> 00:20:58.073
No thanks, I'm trying to quit.

00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:01.399
Those, on the other hand...

00:21:09.560 --> 00:21:13.076
"What do you want from this workshop?

00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:14.315
What do you want?"

00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:17.877
I'm not telling them what I want.

00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:21.234
I wanna move back home.

00:21:24.120 --> 00:21:25.713
I want to hug my wife.

00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:31.189
Protect my children,
protect my daughter.

00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:36.676
I wanna move on.

00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:42.036
I want to apologise, to...

00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:45.035
everyone.

00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:49.713
I wanna go to the theater.

00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:57.960
I want to take clean cups
out of the dishwasher

00:21:58.520 --> 00:22:01.194
and put them in the cupboards... at home.

00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:07.032
And the next morning I want to
watch my wife drink from them.

00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:12.509
And I want to make her feel good.

00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:17.031
I want to make her orgasm again...

00:22:19.640 --> 00:22:20.755
and again.

00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:25.040
Truly.

00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:35.794
I just wanna cry, all the time.

00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:21.400
Claire?

00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:41.153
Have you seen my sister?

00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:27.359
Hi, this is Boo.

00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:30.791
I can't come to the phone right now
but please leave me a messiagio

00:25:30.840 --> 00:25:32.114
and I'll get back to you.

00:25:32.160 --> 00:25:33.309
3:1“

00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:39.920
Someone should
probably disconnect that.
