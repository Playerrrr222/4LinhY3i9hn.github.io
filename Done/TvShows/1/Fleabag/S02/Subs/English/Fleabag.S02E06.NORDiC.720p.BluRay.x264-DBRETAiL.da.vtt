00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:26.480
What?

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:31.634
Mm.

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:32.716
What do you think?

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:36.800
I just...

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:40.152
Go on.

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:46.755
I just...
- Go on.

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:47.840
I...

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:52.833
I just can't believe you did that.

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:57.396
I know.

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:07.191
So good to see you.
- We're over the moon.

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.437
Hey, good to see you.
- Love the shirt.

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:10.400
Who is that?

00:01:10.401 --> 00:01:12.357
Ooh, is this a, uh...
- Don't. Come on.

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.553
Ooh!

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.114
Thank you.

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:17.953
What's happened with the priest?

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.400
Oh, pretty.
- Hi. Oh.

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:20.720
Nothing.

00:01:20.721 --> 00:01:23.280
Oh, so good of you to come and get me.

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:25.113
Get you?
- Uh, see me.

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:26.840
Hi, Jake.
- Where's Claire?

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:27.920
Just there.

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:29.590
Your dad's just down there.

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.515
Nice skirts.

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:37.038
Do you need me to say
anything emotional about today?

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.200
No, no. We're good.
- I think we're alright, thanks.

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:42.040
Do you want tequila? I'm gonna get one.
- Hi. Nice to...

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:43.320
How was Klare?

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:45.760
Well, he's crazy about me

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:47.673
so that's a nightmare.
- Nightmare.

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.616
He's back to Finland today anyway,
which is good.

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.760
It's fine. It's totally fine.
- Sounds like it's fine.

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:52.840
It is.

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.639
It's gonna be a lovely day, isn't it?
- I'm afraid so.

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.352
This is my very interesting friend Daniel,
who's deaf.

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.392
I picked him up
at a student gallery opening.

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:05.715
Utterly fascinating.

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.679
Can't hear a thing but is a fabulous
physical communicator

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:09.870
through hands and lips.

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:12.269
Oh! Oh...

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.919
Oh, I love that.

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:17.350
And this is
my extraordinary friend Francine.

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:18.800
She's a lesbian.

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.470
And this is Asif,
my bisexual Syrian refugee friend

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.416
who you haven't actually met yet, darling.
- Hi.

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:25.999
And, Asif, this is, um...

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.276
Oh, my God. This is...

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.438
This is... God, how extraordinary.
I just... I always call you "darling."

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.631
This is the love of my life.

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:41.320
Hi.

00:02:41.321 --> 00:02:44.358
Is there somewhere I can put this?
- We said no presents!

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:45.914
Oh, you're such a sweetheart.

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:47.633
She's a natural rule breaker.

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:49.030
Not today.
- No.

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.789
Ah, well, I've been trying
to get rid of it for ages, so...

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:52.840
Oh.

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:54.960
Thank you.

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:58.513
I'm going to open it over a bin
so I've got somewhere to put the paper.

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:02.714
Um, come with me.

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.559
Uh, are you short on staff or what?

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:10.115
Do you need me, or...?
- No.

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.959
I just wondered if you had
a little show planned.

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.798
What?
- Well, you normally do.

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.995
And I wondered if there was anything
I might need to know about

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:20.040
that might happen later.

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:21.360
No.

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:22.760
Good.

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:24.712
Well, let me know
if you change your mind

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:27.470
because today is the most
important day of my life.

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:29.958
And I love your father very much.

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:32.990
And I imagine you'd rather have me
looking after him

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.191
in the years to come
than having to do it yourself.

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.753
So, no more miscarriages.

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:53.192
It's worth a lot, so...

00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:59.040
Thank you.

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.431
I'll go and put her
straight back on her shelf.

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:10.576
D'you know, I often thought it strange
that of all my pieces

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:11.875
you chose to take her.

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:14.910
Why?
- She was based on your mother.

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:20.711
So nice to have her back in the house.

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:32.800
Oh.
- Oh, fuck!

00:04:32.801 --> 00:04:34.096
Oh! God. Fuck, you're here.
- Oh, Jesus.

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:35.679
I thought you were a fox.

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:37.154
You're not.
- No. Are you...

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:39.914
I didn't know you were...
- No, no, I'm fine. Sorry. I...

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:41.816
No, I just didn't want to...
I'm practicing the homily.

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:43.399
How's it going?
- Not good. Not good.

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:44.476
I can't, I can't...

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:48.560
You look lovely.

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:51.513
Thank you. So do you.

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:54.590
Wait till you see me in the full... shebang.

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:56.871
You're gonna lose your fucking mind.

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:04.996
We just need to get through this bit,
and then we can...

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:07.200
We can...
- Yeah.

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:11.995
Better get changed.
- Yeah.

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:13.320
Good luck.

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:27.073
Oh, my God.
- What?

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:29.637
You have lipstick all...
- Oh, fucking hell.

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:31.296
That would not look good. Is it gone?

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:32.595
Where?

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:34.156
Oh, fucking hell.

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:36.314
I don't know, I don't know...

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:38.479
Oh, I don't know what this feeling is.

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:42.633
Is it God, or is it me?
- I don't know.

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:47.080
I don't know.

00:05:58.360 --> 00:05:59.360
Fuck you, then.

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:11.551
Where's your priest?
- Oh. I don't know.

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:12.960
You OK?

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:15.872
Yes, well, um... I hate my husband

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:19.152
and the man I love is on his way to Finland,
so pretty weird.

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:22.314
Oh, way to upstage the bride!

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:23.720
Tried my best.

00:06:23.721 --> 00:06:25.598
Cute dress.

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:27.353
Oh, look!

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:29.199
Whoo!

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:31.920
This is our very chic priest.
- Oh, good, I was aiming for chic.

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:33.992
Particularly good around the, uh...
- Thank you.

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:36.074
Father, you remember Martin.

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:37.998
Hey, how you doing, man?
- Bit nervous, Martin.

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:39.633
Do you know Jake?

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:41.176
Yes, hello, Jake. How are you?
- Father.

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:44.477
And this is my very interesting friend Lucy,
who is a surrogate.

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:46.239
- Hello, Interesting Lucy.
- Weird.

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:48.279
And this is my unstable step-daughter

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:51.074
who's had a miscarriage.
- Nice to see you again.

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:53.118
You, too.
- But you knew that. You were there.

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:54.640
It was my miscarriage.

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:56.350
What?

00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:58.995
It was my fucking miscarriage.

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:03.156
Yes, I thought you'd find that funny.

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:06.000
How interesting.
- She was just covering for me.

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:09.635
We were pregnant?
- For a few weeks, yes.

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:12.096
It was my baby?
- Sorry, so you haven't had a miscarriage?

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:13.120
No. Sorry.

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:16.080
Wait, what the fuck is going on here?
It-it was my baby?

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:19.520
I guess it was your baby's way of saying
it didn't want you as its father.

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:24.040
Like a goldfish out of the bowl
sort of thing.

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:26.955
Sorry, but whoever had a miscarriage

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:28.640
could you take it to the kitchen, please?

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:31.193
No. Don't follow me, Jake.

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:33.398
Oh, and this is over.

00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:40.958
Ah!

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:45.280
Ooh.

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:49.160
You're leaving me.
- No, no, no.

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:50.998
Yes!
- Are you drunk?

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:52.395
Yes.
- Are you sober?

00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:54.272
A bit. Could you just fuck off...

00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:55.674
Oh, absolutely not.
- OK, no, no.

00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:56.836
I'm staying right here.

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:01.520
I want you to leave me.
- Listen to me. I just, I have...

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:04.314
I think he has a little speech.
- I have a little speech

00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:05.396
that's building here.

00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:10.157
Now, I know you look at me and you see
a bad man with a big beard.

00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:12.630
You are an alcoholic,
and you tried it on with my sister.

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:17.310
Fine. I tried to kiss your sister
on her birthday.

00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:19.233
- My birthday!
- Fine!

00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:22.239
I mix up birthdays,
and I have an alcohol problem

00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:24.351
just like everyone else
in this fucking country!

00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:27.240
But I am here, and I do things.

00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:29.233
I pick up Jake from shit.

00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:30.999
I make dessert for Easter.

00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:32.759
I organise the downstairs toilet.

00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:34.912
I fired the humming cleaner.

00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:37.271
You enjoyed that.
- I hoover the car.

00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:38.794
I put up all your certificates

00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:41.674
and I don't make you feel guilty
for not having sex with me.

00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:43.871
I am not a bad guy!

00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:47.234
I just have a bad personality.
It's not my fault.

00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:51.634
Some people are born
with fucked personalities.

00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:52.920
Look at Jake.

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:55.914
He is so creepy. It's not his fault.

00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:57.833
Why the bassoon?

00:08:57.880 --> 00:08:59.360
You want to know what the bassoon is?

00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:01.711
It's a cry for help!

00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:09.510
The main fucking problem here
is that you don't like me.

00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:18.871
And that has been breaking
my fucking heart for 11 years.

00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:21.671
I love you. I make you laugh.

00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:23.872
I'm a douche, but I make you laugh.

00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:26.475
You said that that was
the most important thing!

00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:38.513
I think the thing that you hate the most
about yourself

00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:41.155
is that you actually love me.

00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:50.279
So, I am not going to leave you

00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:53.439
until you are down on your knees

00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:55.270
and begging me.

00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:09.630
Please leave me!

00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:15.357
Oh, man.

00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:20.118
I didn't think you'd do that in that dress.

00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:24.314
Right. Well...

00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:31.589
I guess the only thing left
for me to say is...

00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:36.560
Fuck you.

00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:38.640
Fuck you.

00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:19.393
What have you done with him?
- Who?

00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:20.480
Your father.

00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:23.355
The wedding is about to start
and no one can find him anywhere.

00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:25.400
Um...
- Can you do something?

00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:27.553
Please. Please.

00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:30.600
Please.

00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:35.196
Garden.
- Upstairs.

00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:36.240
OK.

00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:48.920
Dad?

00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:55.560
Dad.

00:11:56.560 --> 00:11:57.560
I can't get out.

00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:00.954
OK, Dad, you can.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:02.400
I can't. It's a trap.

00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:04.394
I'm stuck.
- No. Dad...

00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:06.909
J-Just, there's nothing I can do.
- Everyone will understand.

00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:09.880
Just give them all a bottle to take home.
Honestly, they will be relieved.

00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:12.872
My foot... is stuck.

00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:14.800
Oh.

00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:16.954
"Everyone will understand"?

00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:18.840
Um...

00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:22.237
W-Will you help me, please?
- Oh.

00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:26.272
How is it stuck?
- Just help me get it out.

00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:27.993
I'm going to be in so much trouble.

00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:29.952
What are you doing up here?
- I'm...

00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:33.837
I just remembered that I had left a...
a friendly mousetrap

00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:36.156
up here a few weeks ago,
and I hadn't checked it

00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:38.078
and I just wanted to make sure

00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:41.033
that one little chap
hadn't got, uh, trapped in it

00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:43.436
and was, uh...
was suffocating up here.

00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:45.760
Like...

00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:53.639
Think I've worked out what we need to do.
- Well, let's do it.

00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:55.640
Do it.

00:12:57.040 --> 00:12:58.040
Darling.

00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:00.560
I'll do it if you tell me
why you're up here.

00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:02.554
Just one honest answer.

00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:05.394
I... What? What, I...

00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:06.640
I don't think...

00:13:06.641 --> 00:13:07.869
One full sentence.

00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:12.154
I was checking on the mouse.

00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:16.960
Dad.

00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:20.656
Do you wanna make a run for it?

00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:22.456
I can smuggle you out
in one of Mum's dresses.

00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:24.392
You would, as well.

00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:28.031
No, I-I know she's not...

00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:31.160
everyone's cup of tea.

00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:36.393
And neither are you, darling.

00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:38.315
I mean, I'm sorry...

00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:43.032
I love you, but I'm not sure
that I like you all the time.

00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:44.880
Sorry.

00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:46.680
Hey, you created this monster.

00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:50.796
You're not the way you are because of me.

00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:51.880
I know.

00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:55.392
You're the way you are because of her.

00:13:57.600 --> 00:14:00.638
And it's those bits
that you need to cling to.

00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:04.672
Alright, can you get my shoe out?

00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:09.196
I just want you all to be proud of me.

00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:11.350
We are proud of you, Dad.

00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:14.440
You have two daughters who love you,
even if you don't like them.

00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:16.631
I like Claire.

00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:18.718
Jesus, Dad!

00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:25.518
Thank you.
- OK...

00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:28.880
Come on.

00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:31.833
I-I don't think I can go...

00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:33.674
Come on. Buck up.

00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:36.669
Smiles, charm. Off we go.

00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:45.317
I think you know how to love
better than any of us.

00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:48.715
That's why you find it all so painful.

00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:55.475
I don't find it painful.

00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:06.240
There, there, there.

00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:08.638
OK, go, go, go.

00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:20.880
OK, Dad.

00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:22.714
No, don't. Stay with me.

00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:24.240
Stay, stay.

00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:32.160
Hi.

00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:47.634
Darling.

00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:48.680
Sorry.

00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:53.240
Good afternoon, everybody.

00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:56.678
Thank you for coming today
to celebrate the love between

00:15:57.080 --> 00:15:58.719
these two very special people.

00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:03.155
Before we start, uh, Jake has asked
to play another piece on his bassoon.

00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:14.435
I can't do this reading.

00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:16.836
Don't do it.
- What?

00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:19.436
I'll do it.
You go and get him.

00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:21.280
I can't go and get him.

00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:23.557
Why not?
- It's too late.

00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:25.592
I can't leave my father's wedding.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:28.639
He's called "Klare" for God's sake

00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:30.512
and he's already at the airport anyway.

00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:31.720
Well, there you go.

00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:34.320
Is it "running through the airport"
kind of love?

00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:35.760
I'm not going to the airport.

00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:37.473
He'd think I was insane.
- Yeah.

00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:39.400
I'm just saying...
- The airport?

00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:40.556
How would I even find him?

00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:42.871
You can't get through security
without a boarding pass.

00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:44.936
No, I wasn't suggesting that...
- I'd have to buy a dummy ticket

00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:46.096
just to get through the gate.

00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:48.430
I don't know when his flight is
or which terminal.

00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:52.110
Imagine if I knew that.
Imagine him finding out I knew all that.

00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:54.709
Imagine if he was just in Boots
buying a pair of tweezers

00:16:54.760 --> 00:16:56.911
in Terminal Five,
and suddenly I was there.

00:16:57.040 --> 00:16:58.110
"Hello, Klare."

00:16:58.240 --> 00:16:59.640
Yeah. OK, that would be intense.

00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:03.720
The only person
I'd run through an airport for is you.

00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:13.920
Thank you, Jake,
for that beautiful bassoon piece

00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:16.399
uh, written specially for today.

00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:18.274
I believe it's called...

00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:20.440
"Where's Claire?"

00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:28.755
I think what you guys are doing is amazing.

00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:31.240
Sorry...

00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:33.520
Phew! Fuck me.

00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:36.195
Sorry. Didn't get much sleep last night.

00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:41.152
So, it turns out it's quite hard to come up
with something original to say about love

00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:43.710
but I've had a go.

00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:53.436
Love is awful.

00:17:53.800 --> 00:17:55.917
It's awful.

00:17:56.720 --> 00:17:57.680
It's painful.

00:17:57.681 --> 00:17:58.830
It's frightening.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.595
It makes you doubt yourself, judge yourself.

00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:06.360
Distance yourself
from the other people in your life.

00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:07.470
It makes you selfish.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:09.116
It makes you creepy!

00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:11.039
It makes you obsessed with your hair.

00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:13.069
It makes you cruel!

00:18:13.240 --> 00:18:15.994
It makes you say and do things
you never thought you would do!

00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:17.959
There's something wrong with your priest.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.879
It's all any of us want,
and it's hell when we get there!

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:24.710
So no wonder it's something
we don't want to do on our own.

00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:29.273
I was taught, if we're born with love

00:18:29.320 --> 00:18:31.596
then life is about choosing
the right place to put it.

00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:33.876
People talk about that a lot,
it feeling right.

00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:35.274
"When it feels right, it's easy."

00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:36.794
But I'm not sure that's true.

00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:41.194
It takes strength to know what's right.

00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:53.438
And love isn't something
that weak people do.

00:18:55.600 --> 00:18:58.160
Being a romantic
takes a hell of a lot of hope.

00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:02.875
I think what they mean is...

00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:06.792
when you find somebody that you love...

00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:11.550
it feels like hope.

00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:25.830
Go out the side way.

00:19:26.440 --> 00:19:27.440
Now.

00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:40.032
So thank you for bringing us
all together here today.

00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:44.119
To take words from this book of love...

00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:47.354
"Be strong and take heart

00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:51.792
all you who hope in the Lord."

00:19:54.680 --> 00:19:57.149
Um, let's get on with the big bit.

00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:12.191
Oh. There you are.

00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:13.760
Hi.

00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:18.960
Huh.

00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:26.398
Ah...

00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:28.160
Oh, uh...

00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:30.672
Oh, fuck it.

00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:35.960
Thank you.

00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:37.120
Mm.

00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:41.396
And thank you.

00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:47.515
Oh, the, uh, priest is looking for you.

00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:49.640
Oh.

00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:51.672
Don't break his heart.

00:20:55.480 --> 00:20:56.776
Oh, well, thank you so much...
- Hiya.

00:20:56.800 --> 00:20:58.712
Oh, are you leaving?
- Oh, actually, well...

00:20:58.920 --> 00:21:01.310
I thought you were...
- I was changing.

00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:03.631
Oh, yeah.
- What do you do? Do you get the...

00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:05.513
Get the bus, or...?
- Yeah, I get the bus.

00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:07.273
On the road?
- Just on the road.

00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:08.595
I get on the bus.
- Cool.

00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:11.037
OK.
- Well, bye, my daughter.

00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:13.359
Bye, Father.

00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:14.949
Bye, Father.

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:16.400
"Bye, Father."

00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:18.270
Goodbye.
- Bye.

00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:39.873
You nailed it.

00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:50.550
They always lie.
It'll magically come in a minute.

00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:54.160
Yeah.

00:21:55.520 --> 00:21:57.273
They're really into each other, those two.

00:21:57.320 --> 00:21:58.840
It's nice.
- They really pulled it off.

00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:01.680
Was your sister OK? She seemed...
- Yeah. She, um...

00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:03.518
Bit on edge.
- She's run off to a work thing.

00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:05.040
Wow. Dedicated.

00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:06.759
Addicted.

00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:22.595
It's God, isn't it?

00:22:26.840 --> 00:22:27.840
Yeah.

00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:35.552
Damn.

00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:37.960
Damn.

00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:42.719
You know, the worst thing is...

00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:46.394
that I fucking love you.

00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:52.520
I love you.

00:22:55.320 --> 00:22:56.470
No, no, don't.

00:22:56.920 --> 00:22:59.640
No, let's just leave that out there,
just for a second on its own.

00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:03.320
I love you.

00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:16.560
It'll pass.

00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:35.600
This bus is not magically coming.
- I think I'll walk.

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:37.354
OK.

00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:43.960
Uh, see you Sunday?

00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:46.950
I'm joking, you're never ever allowed
in my church again.

00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:52.080
I love you, too.

00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:00.600
OK.
