[intense music playing]

00:00:26.943 --> 00:00:29.654
[Matthew] Boss? Boss, wake up.

00:00:29.738 --> 00:00:31.197
[tapping]

00:00:32.115 --> 00:00:34.743
Hey, boss, come on, get up.

00:00:35.535 --> 00:00:37.037
I mean it, seriously.

00:00:38.371 --> 00:00:41.541
[sighs] We gotta get you out of here.
Gotta get your ruby back.

00:00:41.624 --> 00:00:45.003
But we can't do that
unless you wake the fuck up!

00:00:45.086 --> 00:00:46.379
Wake up!

00:00:46.463 --> 00:00:48.423
[jingles]

00:00:48.506 --> 00:00:50.508
[opera music playing]

00:01:13.073 --> 00:01:15.575
-[waitress] Anywhere you like, hon.
-[TV playing indistinctly]

00:01:15.658 --> 00:01:16.868
I'll be right with you.

00:01:16.951 --> 00:01:18.369
[woman on TV] Don't go away.

00:01:18.453 --> 00:01:20.789
We're about to serve you
a thousand-gallon cup of coffee,

00:01:20.872 --> 00:01:22.457
right after Traffic with Terri.

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:26.127
Right. Uh, looking at traffic,
95 is backed up for a few miles

00:01:26.211 --> 00:01:29.047
after an accident
involving two semitrucks.

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.342
It seems one of the trucks
was carrying hazardous materials.

00:01:32.425 --> 00:01:34.135
Luckily, nothing was spilled…

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:36.221
[chatter continues on TV]

00:01:48.108 --> 00:01:51.069
-[man 1] Thanks, Lindy. Have a good night.
-[Lindy] You too.

00:01:51.945 --> 00:01:53.154
Best seat in the house.

00:01:55.615 --> 00:01:56.825
How are you doing today?

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:01.079
How am I doing? Well…

00:02:03.164 --> 00:02:06.417
I'm feeling better than I have
for quite some time. Thank you.

00:02:06.501 --> 00:02:08.837
Mmm. I could use some of that.
What's your secret?

00:02:10.296 --> 00:02:11.673
Shall I tell you the truth?

00:02:12.423 --> 00:02:14.259
Well, honesty is the best policy.

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:16.845
That's what they say, isn't it?

00:02:18.179 --> 00:02:19.347
Well, I hope it's true.

00:02:19.973 --> 00:02:20.932
This…

00:02:24.018 --> 00:02:25.395
is my secret.

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:27.856
[Bette] It's gorgeous.

00:02:28.565 --> 00:02:30.275
It makes dreams come true.

00:02:32.861 --> 00:02:34.070
I bet it does.

00:02:35.613 --> 00:02:39.325
And what are you dreaming about?
New house? New job?

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:42.704
A new world. A more honest one.

00:02:43.788 --> 00:02:45.248
That is the dream, isn't it?

00:02:46.374 --> 00:02:50.920
Well, can I get you a cup of coffee
while we wait for our dream to come true?

00:02:51.546 --> 00:02:54.716
Please. But we won't be waiting for long.

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:57.135
Then I better hurry up
and get you that coffee.

00:03:02.307 --> 00:03:05.268
[woman on TV] Next, we have
one of our favorite friends at the show,

00:03:05.351 --> 00:03:09.022
Dr. Brenda, in studio to talk about
a new diet that's sweeping the nation.

00:03:10.315 --> 00:03:11.774
Coffee, Lindy?

00:03:11.858 --> 00:03:13.443
Oh, I better not, hon.

00:03:13.526 --> 00:03:16.821
I'm at the end of a double,
and Marsh will be here soon.

00:03:18.656 --> 00:03:22.744
Uh, would you mind watching the front door
while I'm in the ladies room?

00:03:22.827 --> 00:03:25.038
Now, that much I can handle.

00:03:28.499 --> 00:03:30.627
I'll be right back to take your order.

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:33.755
No rush. I have everything I need for now.

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:36.257
[Bette exhales]

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:39.761
[chatter continues on TV]

00:04:08.539 --> 00:04:12.460
[woman on TV] …are advising that
drivers detour on 195 if they can.

00:04:12.543 --> 00:04:14.629
We'll keep you updated
as weather situations…

00:04:14.712 --> 00:04:16.047
[man 2] You by yourself, Lindy?

00:04:17.423 --> 00:04:18.841
No one on the floor.

00:04:18.925 --> 00:04:20.260
[Lindy] No, Bette's here.

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:25.139
[weatherman on TV] It looks like
that particular weather pattern…

00:04:30.478 --> 00:04:33.314
-Hi, Marsh.
-Bette.

00:04:34.107 --> 00:04:35.858
[Lindy] Have fun, you two.

00:04:36.567 --> 00:04:38.778
Mama's got a date
with her blackout curtains.

00:04:38.861 --> 00:04:40.196
[Marsh chuckles] See you, Lindy.

00:04:42.573 --> 00:04:44.450
How are you, Marsh? You good?

00:04:45.076 --> 00:04:46.286
[Marsh] Yeah.

00:04:46.369 --> 00:04:47.787
[doorbell jingles]

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:56.754
[weatherman] Predicting
severe thunderstorms

00:04:56.838 --> 00:04:58.881
from a storm front
moving in from the south.

00:04:58.965 --> 00:05:01.426
Now, those should clear up
by your drive home and…

00:05:02.635 --> 00:05:05.888
Judy, you wanna sit
or get something to go?

00:05:05.972 --> 00:05:07.056
Hmm?

00:05:07.849 --> 00:05:09.475
Coffee? I just made a fresh pot.

00:05:10.184 --> 00:05:11.185
God, yes.

00:05:14.564 --> 00:05:15.773
I'm gonna pee.

00:05:15.857 --> 00:05:18.776
If, uh… If Donna comes,
will you tell her I'm here?

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:20.069
Sure.

00:05:20.153 --> 00:05:21.487
Will you tell her to wait?

00:05:22.739 --> 00:05:25.199
-Absolutely.
-Thanks, Bette.

00:05:34.709 --> 00:05:36.252
[man 3] Hey, give me a minute.

00:05:39.464 --> 00:05:41.049
-[cell phone ringing]
-[sighs]

00:05:45.636 --> 00:05:46.721
Hey.

00:05:46.804 --> 00:05:50.016
Hey, I got your text. What's going on?

00:05:50.099 --> 00:05:52.518
Is Donna there with you?

00:05:52.602 --> 00:05:55.563
[Rose] No, why? You guys okay?

00:05:55.646 --> 00:05:56.939
[Judy] Yeah, we just…

00:05:57.023 --> 00:06:02.111
We had this stupid fight last night
and she left around midnight and…

00:06:02.904 --> 00:06:06.407
-and never came home. So, of course, I'm…
-[objects clattering]

00:06:10.203 --> 00:06:11.788
[softly] freaking the fuck out.

00:06:12.288 --> 00:06:14.082
I'm so sorry, Jude.

00:06:14.165 --> 00:06:16.042
-You haven't heard from her?
-No.

00:06:17.668 --> 00:06:20.004
-Rose?
-I haven't, I swear.

00:06:20.797 --> 00:06:22.423
-Did you try her mom's?
-[scoffs]

00:06:22.965 --> 00:06:24.425
She wouldn't go to her mom's.

00:06:25.843 --> 00:06:26.719
Would she?

00:06:26.803 --> 00:06:29.555
Do you want me
to call over there and find out?

00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:30.473
No. [sniffles]

00:06:31.307 --> 00:06:35.311
I should at least pretend to be a grown-up
and call her myself.

00:06:35.395 --> 00:06:36.229
Okay, then.

00:06:38.564 --> 00:06:39.399
[sniffles]

00:06:39.482 --> 00:06:41.567
[chatter continues on TV]

00:06:45.154 --> 00:06:47.740
I guess Judy and Donna
had another fight last night.

00:06:48.408 --> 00:06:52.245
Donna left and never came home.
Now Judy's calling all over town, frantic.

00:06:54.247 --> 00:06:57.166
I don't know why Judy's
wasting her time on Donna Cavanagh.

00:06:57.917 --> 00:07:00.586
Judy's so pretty,
she could have any man in town.

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:07.468
I think some people
are just afraid to be happy, you know?

00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:10.555
We're running low on mushrooms.

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:13.641
I'll make a note.

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:16.602
-[door opens]
-[doorbell rings]

00:07:23.985 --> 00:07:25.194
One for lunch, handsome?

00:07:25.778 --> 00:07:29.240
Uh, is it okay if I… I'm kinda early
for an interview in the neighborhood.

00:07:29.323 --> 00:07:32.869
-Is it okay if I just have coffee?
-Of course, I just made a fresh pot.

00:07:33.744 --> 00:07:35.955
I'll set you up right here.

00:07:40.168 --> 00:07:41.419
You interviewing at Vanguard?

00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:43.546
How do you know? [chuckles]

00:07:43.629 --> 00:07:46.549
Not a lot of places around here
make you wear a suit to an interview.

00:07:47.258 --> 00:07:48.843
I don't wear them very often.

00:07:48.926 --> 00:07:50.928
Well, you should. It looks good on you.

00:07:54.348 --> 00:07:55.516
They're gonna love you.

00:07:58.561 --> 00:08:01.105
You're very nice. Thank you.

00:08:01.189 --> 00:08:02.607
I'm not being nice. I just…

00:08:03.816 --> 00:08:05.318
I get a sense about people.

00:08:05.401 --> 00:08:06.903
You're gonna get this job.

00:08:14.368 --> 00:08:16.370
Judy, coffee's ready.

00:08:21.167 --> 00:08:23.044
I'll just, uh, refill these creamers.

00:08:24.504 --> 00:08:26.714
No offense, but I'm waiting for someone.

00:08:27.798 --> 00:08:30.092
Well, I can move
if you two would rather sit here.

00:08:30.176 --> 00:08:31.135
We're good, thanks.

00:08:33.721 --> 00:08:34.805
I'm Mark, by the way.

00:08:35.389 --> 00:08:36.891
And I'm gay, so…

00:08:46.734 --> 00:08:48.069
Did you look at the menu?

00:08:48.736 --> 00:08:52.615
I confess, I've been rather distracted.
Perhaps you could recommend something.

00:08:52.698 --> 00:08:53.866
[doorbell jingles]

00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:55.201
[Bette] There they are!

00:08:55.284 --> 00:08:57.328
I am… I'm so sorry. Just one sec.

00:08:57.411 --> 00:08:58.704
Of course.

00:08:58.788 --> 00:09:02.416
[Bette] Happy anniversary, you two!
How are you on your special day?

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:04.544
-How do you remember?
-[woman 1] Every single year.

00:09:04.627 --> 00:09:07.380
How could I forget?
You two are my proudest achievement.

00:09:07.964 --> 00:09:09.173
That's just sad.

00:09:10.341 --> 00:09:11.425
She set them up.

00:09:11.509 --> 00:09:12.426
I set them up.

00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:14.262
-[man 4] Oh, yeah?
-[woman] Oh, wow.

00:09:14.345 --> 00:09:15.346
They were regulars…

00:09:15.429 --> 00:09:17.348
Two of my best customers.

00:09:17.431 --> 00:09:20.226
She thinks she has
this sense about people--

00:09:20.309 --> 00:09:23.688
[Bette] I get this sense about people.
So one day I sat them down side by side…

00:09:23.771 --> 00:09:24.939
Where you're sitting now.

00:09:25.022 --> 00:09:27.400
…and here we all are, five years later.

00:09:27.483 --> 00:09:29.068
The five best years of my life.

00:09:29.151 --> 00:09:30.778
[woman 1 chuckles] Stop it.

00:09:31.279 --> 00:09:33.364
-[woman 2] Congratulations.
-Happy anniversary.

00:09:33.447 --> 00:09:35.032
[woman 1] Thank you so much.

00:09:35.116 --> 00:09:36.409
You think it's sweet?

00:09:36.492 --> 00:09:37.368
[chuckles softly]

00:09:37.868 --> 00:09:39.662
What if she does have
a sense about people?

00:09:40.413 --> 00:09:41.914
She just tried to set us up.

00:09:44.834 --> 00:09:47.086
-[Bette] How's work going?
-[woman 1] Good. Busy.

00:09:47.169 --> 00:09:50.172
Garry's supervising a new venture
that looks promising.

00:09:50.756 --> 00:09:51.674
Right, sweetie?

00:09:51.757 --> 00:09:53.884
How are you, Bette? How's Bernard doing?

00:09:53.968 --> 00:09:56.429
-How's the writing going?
-[woman 1] Yeah, how's the novel?

00:09:56.512 --> 00:09:59.348
Uh, good, you know.
I thought I'd have more time to write

00:09:59.432 --> 00:10:03.060
with Bernard off at college,
but it's been great having him home, so…

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:08.691
What'll I get you two?

00:10:08.774 --> 00:10:09.775
Oh.

00:10:09.859 --> 00:10:11.235
We will have…

00:10:12.445 --> 00:10:13.654
The usual, sweetie?

00:10:14.322 --> 00:10:15.448
Spinach salads.

00:10:15.531 --> 00:10:17.325
-[Marsh] Order up.
-[bell dings]

00:10:17.408 --> 00:10:19.493
Oof. Look at that burger.

00:10:19.577 --> 00:10:21.078
[Garry and Bette chuckle]

00:10:21.162 --> 00:10:24.790
Oh, you've been so disciplined.
We don't want to ruin your macros.

00:10:24.874 --> 00:10:26.542
Mmm, but it's our anniversary.

00:10:28.461 --> 00:10:30.921
You're right. We're celebrating.

00:10:31.005 --> 00:10:32.757
You should get whatever you want.

00:10:33.382 --> 00:10:35.885
Don't say that
or I'll get the double-decker.

00:10:35.968 --> 00:10:36.886
[laughing]

00:10:39.972 --> 00:10:41.223
What's the double-decker?

00:10:41.307 --> 00:10:43.351
Oh, it's got two of everything.
Two patties,

00:10:43.434 --> 00:10:45.728
two layers of bacon,
cheese, two fried eggs.

00:10:45.811 --> 00:10:47.104
Oh, God.

00:10:48.022 --> 00:10:49.231
See?

00:10:50.399 --> 00:10:51.525
Get it.

00:10:51.609 --> 00:10:53.736
I mean, if that's what you want.

00:11:03.412 --> 00:11:04.455
I'll have the salad.

00:11:05.456 --> 00:11:06.832
I admire your discipline.

00:11:06.916 --> 00:11:10.169
Both of you. Spinach salads on the way.

00:11:12.129 --> 00:11:13.172
[cell phone chimes]

00:11:13.756 --> 00:11:14.757
[chuckles softly]

00:11:18.219 --> 00:11:20.429
-[man 5] Thanks.
-[Mark] They're trying to help people.

00:11:20.513 --> 00:11:23.683
[Judy] They're trying to enslave people.
That's what Big Pharma does.

00:11:24.725 --> 00:11:28.979
-You'll find out once you get the job.
-What makes you think I'll get it?

00:11:30.147 --> 00:11:32.316
Vanguard fucking loves people like you.

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:33.526
They're from Vanguard?

00:11:33.609 --> 00:11:34.652
That's the CEO.

00:11:35.736 --> 00:11:37.363
You're kidding. What's his name?

00:11:37.988 --> 00:11:40.282
Dude, she's the CEO.

00:11:40.366 --> 00:11:42.952
-He's the trophy husband.
-Want me to introduce you?

00:11:44.620 --> 00:11:45.830
Don't do it.

00:11:47.206 --> 00:11:50.167
[sighing] Thank you,
but my level, it's probably best

00:11:50.251 --> 00:11:53.337
to stay off the CEO's radar
for as long as possible.

00:11:53.963 --> 00:11:56.340
-Thank you though.
-Well, how about lunch then?

00:11:56.424 --> 00:11:57.800
The CEO's having a spinach salad.

00:11:57.883 --> 00:12:00.219
I could have Marsh put
grilled chicken on that for you.

00:12:01.053 --> 00:12:03.180
Yeah, I've got some time.
That sounds good.

00:12:06.475 --> 00:12:08.060
[Bette] Spinach salad, grilled chicken.

00:12:18.696 --> 00:12:19.697
Oh, my gosh.

00:12:20.656 --> 00:12:23.743
I'm so sorry, sir. It's their anniversary.

00:12:23.826 --> 00:12:26.495
Yes, I heard. You introduced them.

00:12:26.579 --> 00:12:27.455
I did.

00:12:28.247 --> 00:12:32.084
And you're not really
a waitress, are you, Bette?

00:12:35.254 --> 00:12:36.380
You're a writer.

00:12:36.464 --> 00:12:37.381
[chuckles]

00:12:37.465 --> 00:12:40.092
Well, I'm a waitress who writes.

00:12:40.176 --> 00:12:42.136
Fiction? Non-fiction?

00:12:43.012 --> 00:12:45.848
Well, my characters
are all based on real people,

00:12:45.931 --> 00:12:50.311
but it's fiction, I guess,
because all my stories have happy endings.

00:12:51.645 --> 00:12:54.231
Well, that's because
you know when to stop.

00:12:54.857 --> 00:12:55.733
How do you mean?

00:12:56.358 --> 00:12:58.611
The trouble with stories is,

00:12:58.694 --> 00:13:01.739
if you keep them going long enough,
they all end in death,

00:13:03.032 --> 00:13:04.033
don't they?

00:13:05.993 --> 00:13:07.661
-[bell dings]
-[Marsh] Order up.

00:13:08.954 --> 00:13:10.664
So, what'll you have, handsome?

00:13:12.416 --> 00:13:13.584
Ah.

00:13:13.667 --> 00:13:17.671
May I ask, you don't really think
I'm handsome, do you?

00:13:21.634 --> 00:13:22.802
No, of course I don't.

00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:28.516
Then why did you call me that?
Why did you lie?

00:13:31.435 --> 00:13:32.478
I don't know. I…

00:13:34.188 --> 00:13:35.815
I guess I was just trying to be…

00:13:38.442 --> 00:13:40.236
I just wanted to make you feel…

00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:47.993
I wanted you to like me.

00:13:48.577 --> 00:13:49.578
I do like you.

00:13:50.871 --> 00:13:53.791
I like this version of you
much better, don't you?

00:13:58.754 --> 00:14:01.340
Isn't it a relief
to tell the truth for once?

00:14:02.091 --> 00:14:06.220
Don't you wish we could live in a world
where we could say what we actually think?

00:14:08.347 --> 00:14:09.265
I do.

00:14:09.890 --> 00:14:15.271
Well, it starts with us, Bette, you and I.
We're going to change the world.

00:14:15.354 --> 00:14:17.022
Make a more honest one.

00:14:19.441 --> 00:14:21.068
[eerie music playing]

00:14:27.575 --> 00:14:28.534
[chuckles]

00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:40.212
I was trying to be supportive.

00:14:40.296 --> 00:14:43.674
By calling me fat… in front of Bette?

00:14:43.757 --> 00:14:44.675
I did not.

00:14:46.176 --> 00:14:47.303
[cell phone chimes]

00:14:49.346 --> 00:14:50.598
Who keeps texting you?

00:14:50.681 --> 00:14:52.683
Shipping. They want the distro list.

00:14:52.766 --> 00:14:54.143
-[bell dings]
-[Marsh] Order up.

00:14:54.226 --> 00:14:56.395
I sent that to Spencer last night.

00:14:57.730 --> 00:14:58.606
I'll text him.

00:14:58.689 --> 00:14:59.899
Don't do that.

00:15:00.482 --> 00:15:02.735
[intense music playing]

00:15:05.529 --> 00:15:09.408
When Spencer asked me a question
and you answer it? How does that look?

00:15:09.491 --> 00:15:12.036
[woman 1] You care too much
about what other people think.

00:15:12.119 --> 00:15:14.413
Yes, because I'm not the boss.

00:15:14.496 --> 00:15:18.167
I've no authority or credibility
when you do shit like that all the time.

00:15:18.250 --> 00:15:20.377
Lower your voice right now.

00:15:20.461 --> 00:15:21.503
Here we are.

00:15:21.587 --> 00:15:24.089
One spinach salad and one double-decker.

00:15:27.468 --> 00:15:29.595
We didn't order that.
He didn't order that.

00:15:30.512 --> 00:15:33.349
You didn't, did you? Oh, I'm so sorry.

00:15:33.432 --> 00:15:35.476
-It's fine.
-You're not eating that.

00:15:35.559 --> 00:15:36.644
I won't eat the bun.

00:15:36.727 --> 00:15:37.770
Bette, would you mind--

00:15:37.853 --> 00:15:41.357
Can I please
just eat what I want for once, please?

00:15:44.443 --> 00:15:45.319
Thank you, Bette.

00:15:47.071 --> 00:15:48.072
[Garry] Thanks, Bette.

00:16:02.962 --> 00:16:04.672
[Judy] Hey, how many bars do you have?

00:16:05.464 --> 00:16:08.092
I don't think my texts are going through.
Can I text you to see?

00:16:08.175 --> 00:16:10.636
They're going through.
She doesn't wanna hear from you.

00:16:11.929 --> 00:16:13.013
What?

00:16:18.102 --> 00:16:19.895
Uh, I've got four bars.

00:16:19.979 --> 00:16:22.231
Fuck you, dude.

00:16:23.357 --> 00:16:24.274
[sighs]

00:16:43.293 --> 00:16:44.128
Judy?

00:16:47.214 --> 00:16:48.549
Did you hear from Donna?

00:16:54.430 --> 00:16:56.306
You wanna wait a little while longer?

00:17:07.067 --> 00:17:08.235
I'll get you a menu.

00:17:19.079 --> 00:17:20.330
[John] Are you all right?

00:17:28.672 --> 00:17:30.007
I don't think I am.

00:17:30.090 --> 00:17:31.341
-[bell dings]
-[Marsh] Order up.

00:17:31.425 --> 00:17:32.760
[electricity crackling]

00:17:34.178 --> 00:17:36.180
[indistinct chatter on TV]

00:17:37.514 --> 00:17:39.516
[thunder rumbling]

00:17:42.102 --> 00:17:48.400
She left at, like, midnight
and I haven't heard from her since.

00:17:49.109 --> 00:17:51.528
She hasn't answered
my calls or my texts. I…

00:17:53.447 --> 00:17:54.615
I hope she's all right.

00:17:56.408 --> 00:17:57.242
Do you?

00:18:00.704 --> 00:18:03.540
No. Hope she's been
in a fucking car accident,

00:18:03.624 --> 00:18:05.918
at least that would explain
why she hasn't texted back.

00:18:06.752 --> 00:18:08.378
Why did she leave?

00:18:09.213 --> 00:18:11.590
-We had a fight.
-[John] About what?

00:18:13.967 --> 00:18:16.303
I get jealous sometimes.

00:18:17.304 --> 00:18:19.098
Do you think she's cheating on you?

00:18:20.766 --> 00:18:23.477
No, she would never.

00:18:23.560 --> 00:18:25.354
Then why do you get so angry?

00:18:25.437 --> 00:18:26.939
I didn't say I get angry.

00:18:27.898 --> 00:18:29.149
I said I get jealous.

00:18:29.233 --> 00:18:30.692
You're angry now, why?

00:18:30.776 --> 00:18:32.903
Because I don't like people judging me.

00:18:32.986 --> 00:18:34.196
I'm not judging you.

00:18:34.822 --> 00:18:37.157
No one here is judging you.

00:18:39.326 --> 00:18:41.620
Everyone here is judging me.

00:18:42.913 --> 00:18:46.083
You, Bette, Marsh,

00:18:47.459 --> 00:18:50.462
you all think I'd be so much happier
if I just fucked a dude.

00:18:54.383 --> 00:18:56.760
Bette doesn't think
Donna's good enough for you.

00:19:02.182 --> 00:19:03.183
She said that?

00:19:03.267 --> 00:19:05.853
To Marsh. I heard her.

00:19:14.486 --> 00:19:18.157
Yeah, well, she's wrong. I'm the one
who's not good enough for Donna.

00:19:20.159 --> 00:19:22.369
That burger made you
sick to your stomach, didn't it?

00:19:22.452 --> 00:19:23.453
[doorbell jingles]

00:19:27.916 --> 00:19:31.044
There you are. Happy anniversary, you two.

00:19:31.128 --> 00:19:32.087
[woman 1] Hi, Bette.

00:19:32.171 --> 00:19:33.797
How are you on your special day?

00:19:41.096 --> 00:19:42.806
[Bette speaking indistinctly]

00:19:43.849 --> 00:19:45.851
[rumbling]

00:19:47.311 --> 00:19:48.187
[Marsh] Order up.

00:19:50.898 --> 00:19:52.107
Is this right?

00:19:52.191 --> 00:19:53.775
Isn't that what he wanted?

00:19:53.859 --> 00:19:57.821
[weatherman on TV] I usually enjoy being
right about the weather, but not today.

00:19:57.905 --> 00:20:01.742
The storms I predicted
are producing high winds and hail,

00:20:01.825 --> 00:20:04.036
which aren't totally unheard of
this time of year.

00:20:04.119 --> 00:20:07.497
It's just that, apparently,
they're coming down from the north now,

00:20:07.581 --> 00:20:09.333
instead of the storm fronts…

00:20:09.416 --> 00:20:10.584
Who are you texting?

00:20:12.127 --> 00:20:14.504
Shipping. They want the distro list.

00:20:20.219 --> 00:20:21.386
Give me that.

00:20:21.470 --> 00:20:22.971
[Bette] Here we are.

00:20:23.055 --> 00:20:26.558
One spinach salad and one double-decker.

00:20:29.144 --> 00:20:30.687
[exhales sharply]

00:20:30.771 --> 00:20:34.942
Marsh, I salute you. [chuckles]

00:20:35.025 --> 00:20:38.904
Before you two leave, there's a young man
here interviewing at Vanguard today.

00:20:38.987 --> 00:20:40.030
His name is Mark.

00:20:40.113 --> 00:20:42.824
Mark. Mark, come. Meet my friends.

00:20:45.702 --> 00:20:48.205
Kate and Garry Fletcher, this is…

00:20:49.498 --> 00:20:51.833
[nervously] Hi. Mark Brewer.

00:20:51.917 --> 00:20:53.543
Sorry to interrupt.

00:20:55.295 --> 00:20:59.383
Not at all. Bette says
you have an interview with us today.

00:20:59.466 --> 00:21:00.717
Yeah.

00:21:00.801 --> 00:21:04.596
I should probably get going.
I don't wanna be late for it.

00:21:06.682 --> 00:21:08.392
Don't go. We can do it here.

00:21:10.769 --> 00:21:12.396
[chuckles] You mean with you?

00:21:12.479 --> 00:21:13.647
Mmm-hmm.

00:21:13.730 --> 00:21:14.690
Kate?

00:21:14.773 --> 00:21:16.984
Bette speaks very highly of you.

00:21:18.193 --> 00:21:20.821
Please. Sit.

00:21:24.074 --> 00:21:25.409
[chuckles nervously] Yeah.

00:21:35.794 --> 00:21:39.423
You're not gonna believe this.
I think I just got Mark a job at Vanguard.

00:21:43.218 --> 00:21:44.136
Marsh?

00:21:45.887 --> 00:21:47.514
Can you not even look at me?

00:21:48.557 --> 00:21:49.850
We're at work, Bette.

00:21:51.351 --> 00:21:55.480
Well… what about after work?

00:21:56.815 --> 00:21:59.526
You could come over, I can make us dinner.

00:22:02.154 --> 00:22:03.530
Is Bernard gonna be there?

00:22:04.281 --> 00:22:05.157
Probably.

00:22:06.241 --> 00:22:09.536
But Bernard likes you.
He actually talks when you come over.

00:22:09.619 --> 00:22:11.330
He doesn't talk when it's just me.

00:22:14.624 --> 00:22:18.378
And after dinner,
he'll go up to his room and…

00:22:20.630 --> 00:22:22.007
you could come to mine.

00:22:22.090 --> 00:22:23.133
[thunder rumbling]

00:22:27.387 --> 00:22:29.056
I don't think that's a good idea.

00:22:30.724 --> 00:22:31.850
[Bette] Why not?

00:22:34.936 --> 00:22:35.771
Marsh…

00:22:38.148 --> 00:22:39.149
I want to.

00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:41.360
[Bette sighs]

00:22:42.861 --> 00:22:43.737
Don't you?

00:22:48.575 --> 00:22:49.826
You don't want me, Bette.

00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:55.207
You're just bored and lonely
and I'm what's around right now.

00:22:57.084 --> 00:22:58.418
Why would you say that?

00:23:01.963 --> 00:23:03.006
It's okay.

00:23:05.175 --> 00:23:07.052
I'm not interested in you either.

00:23:09.471 --> 00:23:10.806
What, then…

00:23:10.889 --> 00:23:12.766
Then why do you keep comin' over?

00:23:13.767 --> 00:23:16.269
Because I like to have dinner
with you and Bernard.

00:23:17.020 --> 00:23:19.189
And have somebody else
to cook for a change.

00:23:21.983 --> 00:23:24.903
Then after dinner,
when you fall asleep in front of the TV…

00:23:27.656 --> 00:23:29.741
I like to go upstairs to your son's room.

00:23:31.910 --> 00:23:33.453
Bette, I like fucking him.

00:23:36.581 --> 00:23:40.127
-What?
-Yeah. Sometimes I let him fuck me.

00:23:40.710 --> 00:23:42.838
He's… he's just a kid.

00:23:42.921 --> 00:23:44.214
He's 21, Bette.

00:23:45.173 --> 00:23:48.927
And he knows what he's doing.
I didn't know shit when I was his age.

00:23:51.763 --> 00:23:53.723
[objects clattering]

00:24:00.939 --> 00:24:01.940
[Bette] Excuse me.

00:24:04.568 --> 00:24:06.570
[thunder rumbling]

00:24:18.248 --> 00:24:20.876
Bette, you okay?

00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:24.129
[Bette shakily] I'm fine.
I'll be right out.

00:24:26.631 --> 00:24:28.133
[Kate] Tell me about yourself.

00:24:28.758 --> 00:24:31.428
I graduated, um, three years ago.

00:24:31.511 --> 00:24:35.807
[Kate] No, I know all that from your CV.
Tell me about you.

00:24:37.434 --> 00:24:41.855
Your life. Do you…
Are you married? Do you have kids?

00:24:41.938 --> 00:24:43.231
A girlfriend?

00:24:44.566 --> 00:24:49.779
I think I'm a few years away
from any girl wanting to… date me.

00:24:51.072 --> 00:24:52.073
Why do you say that?

00:24:52.157 --> 00:24:55.035
Because I'm unemployed,

00:24:55.702 --> 00:24:56.536
uh,

00:24:57.078 --> 00:25:00.874
I live in a shitty apartment
with, like… five roommates.

00:25:02.167 --> 00:25:05.504
I can barely take care of myself,
let alone somebody else.

00:25:06.671 --> 00:25:08.423
Isn't that a bit sexist?

00:25:08.507 --> 00:25:10.717
Not every girl needs taking care of.

00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:13.011
-Would you mind telling my mom that?
-[chuckles]

00:25:14.012 --> 00:25:16.598
And every girl I've ever dated.

00:25:16.681 --> 00:25:20.310
When I met Garry,
he was selling gym memberships.

00:25:21.645 --> 00:25:23.980
Now he's a VP at Vanguard.

00:25:26.733 --> 00:25:29.861
Yeah. It's cool that
you guys work together.

00:25:30.695 --> 00:25:32.906
Would you mind telling
my husband that? [chuckles]

00:25:34.282 --> 00:25:37.202
Turns out men don't actually
love taking orders from women.

00:25:39.162 --> 00:25:41.164
-Now who's being sexist?
-[chuckles]

00:25:41.248 --> 00:25:42.123
[chuckles softly]

00:25:42.707 --> 00:25:44.709
Some men love taking orders from women.

00:25:49.130 --> 00:25:50.632
[thunder rumbling]

00:25:53.260 --> 00:25:55.345
[Garry] Yeah, work's good, you know?

00:25:56.471 --> 00:25:57.722
Busy.

00:25:57.806 --> 00:26:00.016
Yeah, haven't seen you guys for a while.

00:26:00.100 --> 00:26:02.018
Yeah, Kate's got me on this diet.

00:26:03.353 --> 00:26:04.354
[chuckles]

00:26:05.021 --> 00:26:07.857
I don't get to the gym as often
as I used to, you know, with work.

00:26:07.941 --> 00:26:11.152
You're not gonna be on your deathbed
wishing you'd been to the gym more often.

00:26:11.236 --> 00:26:13.446
You know, that is very true.

00:26:16.950 --> 00:26:19.578
So, are you and Bette…

00:26:21.746 --> 00:26:22.622
No.

00:26:24.332 --> 00:26:25.625
She likes you though.

00:26:25.709 --> 00:26:27.627
Not anymore, she doesn't.

00:26:29.713 --> 00:26:30.547
Ah.

00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:33.258
Sorry to ruin your lunch.

00:26:33.341 --> 00:26:35.218
No, you didn't ruin my lunch.

00:26:35.844 --> 00:26:38.680
Kate did. She's auditioning the new me.

00:26:47.105 --> 00:26:48.732
Shame about my burger though.

00:26:49.566 --> 00:26:51.026
You want me to make you a new one?

00:26:52.277 --> 00:26:54.070

-Sure.

-Oh, no, I… No, I was waiting for you.

00:27:12.005 --> 00:27:12.922
Are you okay?

00:27:17.052 --> 00:27:18.261
Is it Marsh?

00:27:19.804 --> 00:27:22.974
I… I see the way
you look at him sometimes, so--

00:27:23.058 --> 00:27:24.851
Oh, what is wrong with me?

00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:28.897
Nothing. If he broke up with you,
there's something wrong with him.

00:27:29.731 --> 00:27:31.149
He didn't break up with me.

00:27:32.192 --> 00:27:33.693
Apparently, we weren't even dating.

00:27:33.777 --> 00:27:36.404
Shit. I'm sorry.

00:27:36.488 --> 00:27:38.573
No. No, it's a good thing.

00:27:39.366 --> 00:27:40.367
Believe me.

00:27:44.412 --> 00:27:45.747
I should get back to work.

00:27:47.999 --> 00:27:51.211
[Judy] Really? You gonna be
okay in there with Marsh?

00:27:57.926 --> 00:27:58.927
You know what?

00:28:00.470 --> 00:28:01.471
Fuck Marsh.

00:28:11.898 --> 00:28:14.567
[Kate] He used to be really attractive.

00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:17.362
[Mark] Uh, he's still a handsome guy.

00:28:19.322 --> 00:28:20.865
I guess I just know him now.

00:28:22.325 --> 00:28:25.829
God, what happens
once you get to know someone?

00:28:25.912 --> 00:28:27.288
Once you get to know Garry…

00:28:30.709 --> 00:28:34.671
He'll fuck anything… except me.

00:28:37.507 --> 00:28:39.050
Which is fine,

00:28:40.593 --> 00:28:42.512
because he's not very good at it.

00:28:47.350 --> 00:28:48.351
Are you?

00:28:49.227 --> 00:28:51.396
[Garry] It's all about control with Kate.

00:28:54.566 --> 00:28:56.443
When I met her, I had nothing.

00:28:57.777 --> 00:29:01.781
She gave me everything,
but not because she loves me. No.

00:29:02.449 --> 00:29:04.951
So I won't leave, so she won't be alone.

00:29:05.034 --> 00:29:07.704
So people will think
she's lovable, but she's not.

00:29:09.914 --> 00:29:11.166
She's cold.

00:29:11.249 --> 00:29:13.626
She's perfect, and I'm not.

00:29:15.170 --> 00:29:17.589
I love to eat, drink, fuck.

00:29:21.009 --> 00:29:22.761
Kate doesn't like to do
any of those things.

00:29:24.220 --> 00:29:25.638
So, what do you do?

00:29:28.224 --> 00:29:31.102
[Garry] When I'm with her, I'm a good boy.

00:29:32.937 --> 00:29:33.897
When I'm not…

00:29:36.232 --> 00:29:37.275
I'm pretty bad.

00:29:39.736 --> 00:29:40.904

I think we broke up last night.

00:30:01.382 --> 00:30:02.842
Oh, no, I'm so sorry.

00:30:04.844 --> 00:30:07.055
I know you don't like her.

00:30:07.138 --> 00:30:08.973
Well, that's not true. I just…

00:30:10.517 --> 00:30:12.310
I don't like her for you.

take care of all the time.

[Bette] No.

Or yes, I don't know.

00:30:36.626 --> 00:30:38.336
and how beautiful. And…

[thunder rumbling]

00:38:54.623 --> 00:38:56.876
Ninety-five is an inferno,

00:38:56.959 --> 00:38:59.962
and the high winds
are carrying burning hot ash

00:39:00.046 --> 00:39:01.881
into the surrounding neighborhoods.

00:39:01.964 --> 00:39:03.591
[chatter continues on TV]

00:39:07.720 --> 00:39:09.305
How is this a better world?

00:39:17.063 --> 00:39:19.190
You're still seeing it with your eyes.

00:39:21.359 --> 00:39:22.693
You need to close them.

00:39:24.487 --> 00:39:26.238
Embrace the darkness.

00:39:32.286 --> 00:39:33.287
[screams]

00:39:34.872 --> 00:39:36.165
[Bette] I see the future.

00:39:40.169 --> 00:39:41.170
[John] Then tell me.

00:39:44.173 --> 00:39:45.549
Tell me my future.

00:39:48.803 --> 00:39:50.012
[echoing] You come from dust.

00:39:52.098 --> 00:39:53.682
You walk the dust.

00:39:53.766 --> 00:39:55.017
You go back to dust.

00:39:55.768 --> 00:39:58.646
That's everyone's future.
Tell me my future.

00:39:59.522 --> 00:40:01.816
There is no future for you, John Dee.

00:40:01.899 --> 00:40:06.862
It is bound by walls and guards
and the sour smell of madness.

00:40:06.946 --> 00:40:10.116
And then the skein of your life is cut,
son of your mother.

00:40:10.825 --> 00:40:14.120
No. Look again. Tell me my future.

00:40:15.204 --> 00:40:18.124
You have stolen
some of the power of Dream's.

00:40:18.207 --> 00:40:20.126
You will take all of it.

00:40:20.209 --> 00:40:23.379
You will crush
the Dream lord's life in your hands.

00:40:44.150 --> 00:40:45.067
Hello.

00:40:45.151 --> 00:40:46.569
[sighs]

00:40:46.652 --> 00:40:47.778
I'm John.

00:40:49.071 --> 00:40:51.365
I'm glad you're here.
The power has gone out.

00:40:52.950 --> 00:40:55.870
So there's no TV,
and no one left to talk to.

00:40:55.953 --> 00:40:58.038
What is it you think you're doing?

00:40:59.665 --> 00:41:01.792
Saving the world from its lies.

00:41:02.376 --> 00:41:03.919
The ruby wasn't made for that.

00:41:07.882 --> 00:41:10.009
Oh, you're The Sandman.

00:41:11.510 --> 00:41:14.388
My mother was right.
She said you'd be coming for it.

00:41:14.472 --> 00:41:18.309
You must return it to me so that
I can repair the damage you have done.

00:41:18.392 --> 00:41:20.019
I'm not giving it to you, it's mine.

00:41:20.102 --> 00:41:24.273
It is harming you, John, and your world.

00:41:24.356 --> 00:41:26.025
It's revealing the truth.

00:41:27.776 --> 00:41:31.197
-This is the truth of mankind.
-No. You're wrong.

00:41:33.449 --> 00:41:35.284
This is the truth of mankind.

00:41:37.203 --> 00:41:41.749
-[Bette] How's work going?
-[Kate] Good, you know. Busy.

00:41:41.832 --> 00:41:43.334
[John] They're lying to themselves.

00:41:44.627 --> 00:41:47.588
Garry's supervising a new venture
that looks promising.

00:41:47.671 --> 00:41:48.756
[John] It's all lies.

00:41:48.839 --> 00:41:52.551
[Dream] Not lies, John. Dreams.

00:41:52.635 --> 00:41:53.469
Right, sweetie?

00:41:53.552 --> 00:41:57.306
[Dream] Kate dreams of running away,
where no one will find her.

00:41:58.432 --> 00:41:59.391
How are you, Bette?

00:42:00.267 --> 00:42:03.604
[Dream] Garry dreams of proving
his father was wrong about him.

00:42:03.687 --> 00:42:04.980
How's Bernard doing?

00:42:05.064 --> 00:42:07.733
-How's your writing going?
-[Kate] Yeah, how's the novel?

00:42:07.816 --> 00:42:08.943
[Bette] Good, you know.

00:42:09.026 --> 00:42:13.697
Bette dreams of creating something
that matters to people.

00:42:15.950 --> 00:42:18.202
Their dreams inspired them.

00:42:18.994 --> 00:42:21.664
I thought I'd have more time to write
with Bernard off at college,

00:42:21.747 --> 00:42:24.416
but it's been great having him home, so…

00:42:24.500 --> 00:42:26.377
[Dream] Their dreams kept them alive.

00:42:28.128 --> 00:42:30.297
But if you rob them of their dreams,

00:42:31.340 --> 00:42:36.303
if you take away their hope, then… yes,

00:42:37.721 --> 00:42:40.140
this is the truth of mankind.

00:42:42.184 --> 00:42:44.645
The ruby is hurting you, John.

00:42:45.396 --> 00:42:48.190
It has too much of my power within it.

00:42:48.774 --> 00:42:50.734
It stole more when I tried to use it.

00:42:51.652 --> 00:42:54.321
Then perhaps if I use it
to steal the rest of your powers,

00:42:54.405 --> 00:42:56.031
I will be the King of Dreams.

00:42:57.408 --> 00:43:02.204
If you'd rob a Dream lord of his power,
you shall do so in his realm.

00:43:04.748 --> 00:43:05.708
In dreams.

00:43:05.791 --> 00:43:08.043
[dramatic music playing]

00:43:24.643 --> 00:43:26.645
[suspenseful music playing]

00:43:51.587 --> 00:43:53.339
[footsteps approaching]

00:44:22.910 --> 00:44:24.495
[woman laughs]

00:44:43.555 --> 00:44:45.432
Welcome home, Johnny.

00:44:45.516 --> 00:44:46.934
-[glass breaks]
-[John gasps]

00:44:48.352 --> 00:44:50.771
Don't be such a baby, Johnny.

00:44:51.397 --> 00:44:52.898
[laughs]

00:44:54.066 --> 00:44:56.068
[baby crying]

00:44:58.153 --> 00:44:59.613
[Ethel] Go to sleep, Johnny.

00:44:59.697 --> 00:45:01.240
-Please.
-Mother?

00:45:01.323 --> 00:45:04.910
[Ethel] Johnny, you have to go to sleep.

00:45:08.288 --> 00:45:11.959
[whispering] Your father was right.
I never should have had you.

00:45:12.793 --> 00:45:14.211
[John choking]

00:45:15.587 --> 00:45:17.047
It's a dream!

00:45:18.507 --> 00:45:19.717
[gasping] It's a dream.

00:45:21.760 --> 00:45:22.678
It's a dream.

00:45:22.761 --> 00:45:24.555
[panting]

00:45:50.038 --> 00:45:54.710
Is this your palace… Dream lord?

00:45:57.045 --> 00:46:01.759
Is this your throne… King of Lies?

00:46:03.385 --> 00:46:05.596
Well, it's mine now!

00:46:08.599 --> 00:46:09.808
Are you watching?

00:46:12.060 --> 00:46:13.687
Can you see me?

00:46:19.026 --> 00:46:23.280
Using your own powers
to burn away your lies?

00:46:23.363 --> 00:46:24.573
[Dream] You must stop.

00:46:31.079 --> 00:46:33.415
It is not too late to save yourself.

00:46:33.499 --> 00:46:35.793
Oh, you think it's me that needs saving?

00:46:36.376 --> 00:46:40.923
[Dream] Your father stole the ruby
from me and cursed you with it.

00:46:41.965 --> 00:46:44.051
You mean he blessed me with it.

00:46:48.680 --> 00:46:49.556
Your reign

00:46:51.683 --> 00:46:54.812
ended when my father captured you.

00:46:56.522 --> 00:46:57.773
Your kingdom

00:46:59.775 --> 00:47:01.276
is my birthright.

00:47:09.535 --> 00:47:13.121
Your power resides within me.

00:47:19.586 --> 00:47:23.590
How does it feel to know
I hold your life in my hands?

00:47:23.674 --> 00:47:25.092
[Dream groaning]

00:47:26.093 --> 00:47:29.596
[Dream grunting in pain] You're hurting
the dreamers.

00:47:29.680 --> 00:47:32.224
Well, it's time they woke up!

00:47:35.644 --> 00:47:40.732
Your life and your lies end now.

00:48:02.546 --> 00:48:03.630
I did it.

00:48:06.091 --> 00:48:07.593
I killed him.

00:48:10.929 --> 00:48:11.972
I won.

00:48:14.141 --> 00:48:15.976
[Dream] Thank you, John.

00:48:16.059 --> 00:48:17.853
[captivating music playing]

00:48:31.158 --> 00:48:32.576
But I killed you.

00:48:33.744 --> 00:48:37.497
You destroyed the ruby
and released the power inside it.

00:48:38.081 --> 00:48:39.875
I would never have thought of that.

00:48:41.084 --> 00:48:44.588
I'd forgotten just how much of myself
I had placed in the jewel.

00:48:45.964 --> 00:48:47.382
Are you going to kill me?

00:48:49.009 --> 00:48:49.968
I could.

00:48:51.678 --> 00:48:52.846
Perhaps I will.

00:48:55.766 --> 00:48:58.393
But the dream stone
was not made for mortals.

00:48:59.394 --> 00:49:01.772
And it came to you
through no fault of your own.

00:49:03.982 --> 00:49:06.944
So, no, John. I will not kill you.

00:49:09.863 --> 00:49:11.281
Sleep well, John.

00:49:38.850 --> 00:49:41.895
[Matthew] All the damage the ruby did,
can you undo it?

00:49:43.105 --> 00:49:44.523
The ruby didn't do this.

00:49:45.482 --> 00:49:50.529
John merely used it to reveal wounds
that were hidden, but never healed.

00:49:51.780 --> 00:49:54.491
Tomorrow, the rebuilding will begin.

00:49:56.034 --> 00:49:57.703
In this realm and in mine.

00:49:58.954 --> 00:50:00.205
But tonight at least…

00:50:02.833 --> 00:50:04.501
humanity will sleep in peace.

00:50:20.934 --> 00:50:22.936
[intense music playing]

00:50:26.440 --> 00:50:27.441
I'm watching you…

00:50:29.609 --> 00:50:30.777
big brother.

00:50:32.821 --> 00:50:34.573
[laughing]

00:50:38.076 --> 00:50:40.078
[theme music playing]
