00:00:11.011 --> 00:00:13.013
[suspenseful music playing]

00:00:28.069 --> 00:00:29.529
[Dream] It has many names.

00:00:30.155 --> 00:00:34.576
Avernus, Tartarus, Hades,

00:00:34.659 --> 00:00:37.829
the infernal region you call Hell.

00:00:39.205 --> 00:00:41.374
[Matthew] So, Hell does exist?

00:00:42.375 --> 00:00:45.128
[Dream] It does. For some.

00:00:45.795 --> 00:00:49.090
[Matthew] Does that mean it doesn't exist
if you don't believe in it?

00:00:51.051 --> 00:00:55.513
[Dream] Did you believe in it?
When you were a man?

00:00:55.597 --> 00:00:56.514
[sighing] Yeah.

00:00:57.098 --> 00:01:00.393
I just didn't expect Hell to be cold.

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:05.648
So, which way do we go?

00:01:06.566 --> 00:01:08.443
I suggest we follow the damned.

00:01:08.526 --> 00:01:10.528
[ominous music playing]

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.118
[Matthew] They make you
bring your own fire to Hell?

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:45.897
[car horn honks]

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:47.440
[brakes screech]

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:49.943
[exclaims]

00:01:50.693 --> 00:01:51.903
[tires screech]

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:56.658
[woman] Are you all right?

00:01:56.741 --> 00:01:57.951
I-I think so.

00:01:58.993 --> 00:02:01.329
-Here, let me help you.
-[grunts] Thank you.

00:02:01.955 --> 00:02:02.831
[sighs]

00:02:03.456 --> 00:02:04.624
I'm so sorry.

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.543
It's my fault entirely.

00:02:07.252 --> 00:02:08.211
I…

00:02:08.294 --> 00:02:10.296
I lost my slippers somewhere.

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:11.923
Oh. Here you go.

00:02:12.006 --> 00:02:13.967
Oh. You're very kind.

00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:17.345
I suppose I'm rather underdressed.

00:02:17.428 --> 00:02:20.723
Listen, if it were up to me,
I'd never get out of my pajamas.

00:02:23.143 --> 00:02:24.185
You live nearby? Or…

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:26.479
No, I, uh…

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.234
I've no idea where I am, actually.

00:02:34.529 --> 00:02:36.906
Can I… Do you need a ride somewhere?

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:38.533
I'd be happy to take you.

00:02:39.117 --> 00:02:40.535
I'd hate to impose.

00:02:40.618 --> 00:02:42.495
You're not imposing at all. Honestly.

00:02:43.037 --> 00:02:43.872
Where are we headed?

00:02:43.955 --> 00:02:45.874
Do you where Mayhew is?

00:02:46.749 --> 00:02:50.086
It's on my way. I live in Cumberland.
I'm Rosemary.

00:02:52.172 --> 00:02:54.007
Hello, Rosemary. I'm John.

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:55.258
Good to meet you, John.

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:57.886
Come on, I'll introduce you to Susie.

00:02:58.428 --> 00:03:00.513
-Who's Susie?
-My Rottweiler.

00:03:00.597 --> 00:03:01.973
[Susie panting]

00:03:15.195 --> 00:03:17.447
We're not sneaking in with them?

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:20.950
[Dream] A king may not enter
another monarch's realm uninvited.

00:03:22.035 --> 00:03:26.706
There are rules,
protocols which must be followed.

00:03:33.838 --> 00:03:34.797
[caws]

00:04:07.914 --> 00:04:09.540
[gong echoes]

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:16.631
[exhales heavily]

00:04:20.301 --> 00:04:22.095
[demon] There's one at the door.

00:04:22.637 --> 00:04:24.389
At the gate of damnation.

00:04:25.431 --> 00:04:29.102
Is it thief, thug or whore?

00:04:29.185 --> 00:04:30.603
There's one at the door.

00:04:31.312 --> 00:04:33.147
And there's room for one more.

00:04:34.107 --> 00:04:36.609
Till the end of creation.

00:04:38.361 --> 00:04:39.362
[Squatterbloat chuckles]

00:04:40.738 --> 00:04:42.573
Greetings, Squatterbloat.

00:04:44.826 --> 00:04:46.744
I seek an audience with your sovereign.

00:04:46.828 --> 00:04:47.662
[chuckles]

00:04:48.413 --> 00:04:49.789
And who might you be?

00:04:49.872 --> 00:04:51.874
I am the King of Dreams.

00:04:53.042 --> 00:04:55.336
Ruler of the Nightmare Realms.

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:57.463
Mm. Yes, my clown.

00:04:59.716 --> 00:05:00.967
So, where's your crown?

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:01.884
[scoffs]

00:05:02.468 --> 00:05:04.345
Guard your tongue, demon.

00:05:05.388 --> 00:05:09.684
The Ruler of Hell will not be kind
to one who insults an honored guest.

00:05:09.767 --> 00:05:15.982
And I am a guest in this realm
as I am monarch of my own.

00:05:16.607 --> 00:05:18.026
So where's your ruby?

00:05:20.361 --> 00:05:22.280
Shall I use it to haunt your dreams?

00:05:23.656 --> 00:05:25.742
And your waking hours, too?

00:05:26.576 --> 00:05:30.663
Or will you open the gates of Hell
and let us through?

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:34.125
-[keys jangle]
-[lock clicks]

00:05:43.676 --> 00:05:47.263
Now, take us to the palace.

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:49.807
[Squatterbloat] There's one at the door.

00:05:49.891 --> 00:05:51.642
There's one at the door.

00:05:52.143 --> 00:05:53.686
There's one at the door.

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:56.564
So, you live in Mayhew?

00:05:56.647 --> 00:05:57.774
[John] Not anymore.

00:05:57.857 --> 00:06:00.777
My, uh… things are there.

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:02.779
So you used to live in Mayhew?

00:06:02.862 --> 00:06:03.696
Uh…

00:06:04.614 --> 00:06:06.616
Yes. Few years ago.

00:06:08.868 --> 00:06:12.830
My mother's work forced us
to move around quite a bit.

00:06:12.914 --> 00:06:14.082
Mm. What does she do?

00:06:16.709 --> 00:06:18.836
Actually, she passed away quite recently.

00:06:19.796 --> 00:06:20.630
Oh, John…

00:06:20.713 --> 00:06:23.925
It's only just happened,
so I'm, I'm, I'm still a little bit--

00:06:24.008 --> 00:06:24.926
Of course.

00:06:26.469 --> 00:06:28.137
I'm so sorry, John.

00:06:28.221 --> 00:06:30.431
She wasn't a very good person, I'm afraid.

00:06:31.432 --> 00:06:34.394
That's an awful thing to say, isn't it?
Even if it's true.

00:06:37.021 --> 00:06:40.900
No. I have a mother like that, too.

00:06:40.983 --> 00:06:44.862
Really? What does she do?

00:06:44.946 --> 00:06:47.865
She watches cable news. All day.

00:06:48.449 --> 00:06:49.909
That's what she does.

00:06:50.952 --> 00:06:53.746
What about yours? When she was alive?

00:06:56.416 --> 00:06:57.792
When she was alive,

00:06:59.377 --> 00:07:02.213
my mother was a very successful thief.

00:07:02.296 --> 00:07:03.256
[chuckles]

00:07:04.298 --> 00:07:06.134
-Really?
-Yes, I'm afraid so.

00:07:06.843 --> 00:07:08.052
What did she steal?

00:07:08.928 --> 00:07:10.596
Is that rude? To ask? I'm sorry.

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:11.681
No, not at all.

00:07:11.764 --> 00:07:14.100
Uh, she stole anything and everything.

00:07:14.183 --> 00:07:18.688
She stole art. She stole jewelry.
Other people's identities.

00:07:18.771 --> 00:07:20.898
Which is why we had
to keep moving all the time.

00:07:20.982 --> 00:07:23.359
It's why she lied about everything.

00:07:23.943 --> 00:07:24.819
Even to me.

00:07:28.281 --> 00:07:30.158
Well, maybe she was trying to protect you.

00:07:30.741 --> 00:07:31.576
[scoffs]

00:07:33.703 --> 00:07:37.081
Spoken like a woman
with children of her own.

00:07:37.165 --> 00:07:40.960
Two girls. Samantha, Sarah.

00:07:41.043 --> 00:07:41.919
[John] Mm.

00:07:47.341 --> 00:07:49.594
Rosemary, may I ask you something?

00:07:49.677 --> 00:07:50.595
[Rosemary] Of course.

00:07:51.179 --> 00:07:52.138
[John] Do you lie?

00:07:53.598 --> 00:07:55.183
To Samantha and Sarah?

00:07:59.645 --> 00:08:02.607
Their dad was the liar in the family.

00:08:03.524 --> 00:08:05.776
We were married ten years

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:10.615
before I found out he had another wife
and another kid in another town.

00:08:10.698 --> 00:08:12.617
-Oh, my goodness.
-Yeah.

00:08:15.036 --> 00:08:19.165
I think lying is maybe the worst thing
you can do to another person.

00:08:22.168 --> 00:08:23.878
I'm living proof of that.

00:08:26.297 --> 00:08:29.091
I'm sure your mom loved you
and was proud of you.

00:08:30.301 --> 00:08:32.136
She did forgive me in the end.

00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:34.931
-For what?
-Stealing from her.

00:08:35.014 --> 00:08:36.891
-What did you steal?
-A ruby.

00:08:38.059 --> 00:08:40.228
Unlike no other.
Like nothing you've ever seen.

00:08:40.311 --> 00:08:42.772
She had me arrested, of course.
And thrown in prison.

00:08:42.855 --> 00:08:45.107
-For stealing the ruby?
-And arson.

00:08:45.191 --> 00:08:46.776
[intense music playing]

00:08:46.859 --> 00:08:47.902
And murder.

00:08:49.195 --> 00:08:51.239
General mayhem. Among other things.

00:08:51.322 --> 00:08:53.366
You see, the problem with having this ruby

00:08:53.449 --> 00:08:55.660
was that everyone was always trying
to take it from me.

00:08:55.743 --> 00:08:57.787
And so, I just did what I had to do.

00:09:01.207 --> 00:09:02.458
You murdered people?

00:09:02.542 --> 00:09:04.043
They weren't good people.

00:09:06.712 --> 00:09:10.132
Not like you and Susie.

00:09:10.841 --> 00:09:12.260
Isn't that right, Susie?

00:09:13.344 --> 00:09:17.139
Isn't that right, my sweet girl?

00:09:17.890 --> 00:09:19.433
[John chuckles]

00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:32.071
Any idea where we are?

00:09:33.698 --> 00:09:37.159
The landscape is subject to
the whims of the Morningstar.

00:09:37.243 --> 00:09:39.078
The morning star?

00:09:39.161 --> 00:09:41.706
We have to spend the night
in this literally godforsaken--

00:09:41.789 --> 00:09:43.833
Lucifer Morningstar.

00:09:44.584 --> 00:09:46.294
[Matthew] As in the Devil?

00:09:46.377 --> 00:09:48.462
The Ruler of Hell is no mere devil.

00:09:49.422 --> 00:09:51.048
So, you two know each other?

00:09:51.132 --> 00:09:53.175
We've known each other
for a very long time.

00:09:54.093 --> 00:09:56.971
When we first met,
Lucifer was the angel Samael.

00:09:57.054 --> 00:09:59.849
I forgot the Devil used to be an angel.

00:09:59.932 --> 00:10:01.142
Not just any angel.

00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:06.606
The most beautiful, wisest,
and most powerful of all angels.

00:10:08.524 --> 00:10:13.195
Saving only the Creator, Lucifer is,
perhaps, the most powerful being there is.

00:10:13.279 --> 00:10:15.197
More powerful than you?

00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:20.077
By far. Especially now.

00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:21.579
[Matthew] Why now?

00:10:21.662 --> 00:10:23.956
The last time I was here,
I was an honored guest.

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:26.125
An envoy from my own kingdom.

00:10:26.626 --> 00:10:28.836
This time, I have invited myself,

00:10:30.171 --> 00:10:32.173
and I lack my symbols of office.

00:10:32.256 --> 00:10:34.300
But you're still
Dream of The Endless, right?

00:10:34.383 --> 00:10:35.468
You got your sand.

00:10:37.428 --> 00:10:39.347
[ominous music playing]

00:10:39.430 --> 00:10:40.681
What's wrong?

00:10:40.765 --> 00:10:43.643
Squatterbloat. He's gone.

00:10:43.726 --> 00:10:45.186
[Matthew] All right, don't panic.

00:10:45.269 --> 00:10:47.313
I'm just gonna fly up
and see where we are.

00:10:50.066 --> 00:10:52.735
Nope, nope. Not doing that.

00:10:52.818 --> 00:10:54.820
[people groaning]

00:10:55.988 --> 00:10:57.990
[branches creaking]

00:10:58.074 --> 00:10:59.992
[moaning and wailing]

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:05.373
[Squatterbloat growls softly]

00:11:07.041 --> 00:11:08.167
This way.

00:11:13.130 --> 00:11:15.508
[Squatterbloat grunts]

00:11:16.384 --> 00:11:19.637
[Matthew] Does this seem like
the way to the palace to you?

00:11:20.638 --> 00:11:23.641
A demon has a hundred motives
for anything he does.

00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:26.185
All of them malevolent.

00:11:26.268 --> 00:11:27.186
Demon.

00:11:28.437 --> 00:11:29.438
[Squatterbloat growls]

00:11:30.022 --> 00:11:31.357
This is not the way.

00:11:31.941 --> 00:11:32.942
[chuckles]

00:11:40.491 --> 00:11:41.409
[woman] Kai'ckul?

00:11:43.285 --> 00:11:44.620
[woman breathing heavily]

00:11:46.997 --> 00:11:48.082
Dream Lord?

00:11:49.667 --> 00:11:50.501
[gasps]

00:11:54.255 --> 00:11:55.881
It is you.

00:12:00.845 --> 00:12:02.930
I greet you, Nada.

00:12:03.013 --> 00:12:04.056
Kai'ckul.

00:12:06.142 --> 00:12:08.394
How I have prayed for this day.

00:12:09.645 --> 00:12:11.355
I knew you would come.

00:12:13.315 --> 00:12:15.943
It pains me to see you like this.

00:12:18.070 --> 00:12:19.947
Then, free me, Lord.

00:12:21.323 --> 00:12:24.660
Only your forgiveness can free me.

00:12:28.956 --> 00:12:30.916
Do you not still love me?

00:12:32.168 --> 00:12:35.504
It has been 10,000 years, Nada.

00:12:41.093 --> 00:12:44.722
Yes. I still love you.

00:12:48.058 --> 00:12:49.769
But I have not yet forgiven you.

00:12:59.069 --> 00:13:00.112
Come, Matthew.

00:13:01.614 --> 00:13:04.909
Kai'ckul, I will not give up hope.

00:13:06.702 --> 00:13:08.621
I will never give up.

00:13:09.830 --> 00:13:11.457
[snarls softly]

00:13:26.472 --> 00:13:30.768
[John] Yes. I admit that in the past
I may have done some things

00:13:30.851 --> 00:13:36.524
that are morally… ambiguous.

00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:39.819
But it taught me about human nature

00:13:39.902 --> 00:13:42.988
and the secret
of real understanding and compassion.

00:13:45.616 --> 00:13:47.368
Do you want to know what it is?

00:13:48.911 --> 00:13:49.745
I do.

00:13:50.287 --> 00:13:52.832
This is going to sound rather odd,

00:13:52.915 --> 00:13:55.501
but the secret
to having compassion for people

00:13:55.584 --> 00:13:59.505
is knowing that
they are fundamentally selfish.

00:14:00.339 --> 00:14:02.007
And I say this without judgement.

00:14:02.091 --> 00:14:05.177
It's how human beings are built.
It's how we're made.

00:14:05.261 --> 00:14:06.887
But if you know that going in,

00:14:06.971 --> 00:14:09.640
if you understand that we are operating

00:14:09.723 --> 00:14:13.269
out of the biological
congenital selfishness,

00:14:13.352 --> 00:14:16.063
then life begins to make a lot more sense.

00:14:17.231 --> 00:14:18.607
[tires screeching]

00:14:19.817 --> 00:14:20.901
Are you all right?

00:14:23.070 --> 00:14:25.406
Uh, sorry. The phone slipped.

00:14:28.868 --> 00:14:29.869
You were saying?

00:14:32.246 --> 00:14:34.832
[John] I… I was saying,

00:14:34.915 --> 00:14:37.293
knowing that people are selfish

00:14:37.376 --> 00:14:42.673
sets you free from having to take
their actions, their lies, personally.

00:14:43.924 --> 00:14:47.052
People lie because they're selfish.

00:14:47.136 --> 00:14:50.180
They lie because they are human.

00:14:51.974 --> 00:14:53.642
They lie because they're scared.

00:14:54.894 --> 00:14:56.645
People will say anything.

00:14:56.729 --> 00:14:59.565
Do anything to keep from being hurt.

00:15:03.485 --> 00:15:05.154
That's what I think, anyway.

00:15:09.992 --> 00:15:11.952
You're very good, Rosemary.

00:15:13.037 --> 00:15:14.622
[Rosemary] I don't know what you mean.

00:15:14.705 --> 00:15:19.752
I mean I experience people
as basically selfish

00:15:19.835 --> 00:15:22.588
and you experience them as afraid.

00:15:22.671 --> 00:15:25.466
Which they are, we all are.
You're absolutely right.

00:15:26.425 --> 00:15:27.384
And good.

00:15:30.512 --> 00:15:31.347
Thank you.

00:15:37.394 --> 00:15:39.146
Do you mind if we stop for gas?

00:15:41.482 --> 00:15:42.650
No, not at all.

00:16:01.627 --> 00:16:03.837
[Matthew] So, that woman back there.

00:16:03.921 --> 00:16:06.256
Anything you wanna share
with your friend Matthew?

00:16:11.637 --> 00:16:13.430
Her name is Nada.

00:16:15.391 --> 00:16:19.436
She was the ruler of a tribe
that call themselves the First People.

00:16:23.065 --> 00:16:24.066
We were in love.

00:16:24.984 --> 00:16:28.612
So what did she do? How'd she end up here?

00:16:29.697 --> 00:16:30.781
She defied me.

00:16:31.323 --> 00:16:34.034
Wait. You put her here?

00:16:34.743 --> 00:16:38.372
The Morningstar is letting me know
that Hell has prepared for my visit.

00:16:45.879 --> 00:16:47.089
Why are we stopping?

00:16:55.681 --> 00:16:56.682
[Dream] We're here.

00:16:56.765 --> 00:16:58.767
[dramatic music playing]

00:17:46.398 --> 00:17:47.232
[caws]

00:18:26.980 --> 00:18:28.148
Hello.

00:18:44.915 --> 00:18:45.874
Hello, Dream.

00:18:47.084 --> 00:18:49.336
Greetings to you, Lucifer Morningstar.

00:18:50.754 --> 00:18:52.506
And to you, Mazikeen of the Lillim.

00:18:54.424 --> 00:18:56.885
Greetings, Dream Lord.

00:18:58.512 --> 00:19:01.056
You look well, Dream. Are you well?

00:19:02.224 --> 00:19:07.479
And your family, Destiny, Death, Despair,
and the others?

00:19:09.439 --> 00:19:12.234
I presume the Ruler of Hell
knows this is no social call.

00:19:12.317 --> 00:19:14.528
Have you come to join forces then?

00:19:15.279 --> 00:19:17.698
To ally your realm to ours?

00:19:17.781 --> 00:19:20.242
To acknowledge the sovereignty of Hell?

00:19:20.909 --> 00:19:22.995
You know
my feelings on that, Lightbringer.

00:19:23.579 --> 00:19:25.122
Feelings change.

00:19:26.415 --> 00:19:31.336
Especially when one has been caught
and imprisoned by mortals.

00:19:32.004 --> 00:19:34.965
We expected better of you, sweet Morpheus.

00:19:35.048 --> 00:19:38.594
I have come because my Helm of State
was stolen from me.

00:19:39.553 --> 00:19:41.388
I believe one of your demons has it.

00:19:42.014 --> 00:19:43.432
I should like it back.

00:19:45.809 --> 00:19:46.643
Now.

00:19:47.269 --> 00:19:50.814
Dream, if only it were that easy.

00:19:51.398 --> 00:19:53.650
But there are rules, you see.

00:19:54.359 --> 00:19:57.070
Protocols which must be followed.

00:20:00.782 --> 00:20:02.576
Which demon has your helm?

00:20:02.659 --> 00:20:05.621
Name it and we will bring it here.

00:20:05.704 --> 00:20:07.664
I confess I do not know the name.

00:20:11.501 --> 00:20:14.421
Then we will have to summon all of them.

00:20:18.592 --> 00:20:20.219
[demons clamoring]

00:20:27.601 --> 00:20:29.937
[Lucifer] There, now, Dream,
you may inquire.

00:20:30.020 --> 00:20:32.356
Which demon has your helmet?

00:20:35.192 --> 00:20:37.444
Shall we interview them one at a time, or…

00:20:39.488 --> 00:20:41.198
That won't be necessary.

00:20:54.962 --> 00:20:58.298
It surprises us
how easily you would give up, Dream.

00:20:59.174 --> 00:21:02.094
We know how you relied upon your tools.

00:21:03.095 --> 00:21:06.974
But tools are the subtlest of traps.

00:21:08.433 --> 00:21:10.143
We become reliant upon them

00:21:10.227 --> 00:21:14.356
and in their absence we are vulnerable,

00:21:15.357 --> 00:21:18.277
weak, defenseless.

00:21:19.611 --> 00:21:20.737
Not entirely.

00:21:25.325 --> 00:21:27.452
I have recovered my sand.

00:21:28.954 --> 00:21:30.372
It brought me to Hell

00:21:31.081 --> 00:21:34.835
and now it brings
that which is mine in Hell to me.

00:22:09.578 --> 00:22:10.996
Tell me your name, demon.

00:22:11.079 --> 00:22:12.372
Do I have to tell him?

00:22:12.456 --> 00:22:16.501
That is Choronzon. A Duke of Hell.

00:22:16.585 --> 00:22:17.794
Choronzon…

00:22:19.796 --> 00:22:24.217
The helm is mine.
You must return it to me.

00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:27.262
No. It's mine now.

00:22:27.888 --> 00:22:30.307
I traded it from a mortal
for a paltry thing.

00:22:30.891 --> 00:22:33.894
It was a fair trade. I've broken no laws.

00:22:34.478 --> 00:22:37.022
And if the Dream King wants his helm back,

00:22:38.899 --> 00:22:40.776
he will have to fight me for it.

00:22:42.235 --> 00:22:43.612
Very well.

00:22:44.821 --> 00:22:46.656
I challenge you, Choronzon.

00:22:47.407 --> 00:22:48.241
[Choronzon chuckles]

00:22:48.325 --> 00:22:50.118
You know the rules, Dream Lord.

00:22:50.202 --> 00:22:53.372
If I win, you will return my helmet.

00:22:53.455 --> 00:22:54.998
And if you lose,

00:22:55.665 --> 00:23:00.837
you'll serve as my slave
in Hell for eternity.

00:23:05.926 --> 00:23:08.011
I accept the terms.

00:23:08.095 --> 00:23:08.929
[caws]

00:23:09.554 --> 00:23:12.808
And whom will you choose
to represent you in the battle?

00:23:13.975 --> 00:23:15.560
I shall represent myself.

00:23:16.603 --> 00:23:21.733
Choronzon, whom will you choose
to represent you?

00:23:21.817 --> 00:23:22.943
Hmm…

00:23:26.863 --> 00:23:30.367
I choose you, sire.

00:23:45.382 --> 00:23:51.096
Apologies, Dream, but the laws of Hell
demand that I become his champion.

00:23:53.765 --> 00:23:55.851
But if you would not fight me.

00:23:58.895 --> 00:24:00.439
I have accepted the terms.

00:24:04.192 --> 00:24:05.694
Let the challenge begin.

00:24:20.333 --> 00:24:21.543
I won't be five minutes.

00:24:21.626 --> 00:24:24.379
-Oh, we'll be fine. You take your time.
-[Susie panting]

00:24:41.563 --> 00:24:43.482
Looks like I have to pre-pay inside.

00:24:43.565 --> 00:24:45.525
Do you want anything? Are you thirsty?

00:24:46.485 --> 00:24:48.236
No, thank you. I'm fine.

00:24:49.529 --> 00:24:50.530
I won't be a minute.

00:24:55.285 --> 00:24:57.996
Actually, uh, Rosemary…

00:24:59.122 --> 00:24:59.998
Uh…

00:25:01.791 --> 00:25:03.919
I could use a drink, if you don't mind.

00:25:04.628 --> 00:25:05.962
Sure. What would you like?

00:25:08.131 --> 00:25:11.593
I don't know. I haven't been out
in the world for 30 years.

00:25:13.261 --> 00:25:14.930
You've been in prison for 30 years?

00:25:15.013 --> 00:25:17.516
No, uh, psychiatric hospital.

00:25:17.599 --> 00:25:21.728
Uh, the beverage options
were extremely limited to say the least.

00:25:21.811 --> 00:25:22.854
After you.

00:25:43.667 --> 00:25:45.126
Whatever you want, my treat.

00:25:46.503 --> 00:25:47.587
Are you sure?

00:25:47.671 --> 00:25:48.588
Absolutely.

00:25:49.214 --> 00:25:51.132
I'll just give the guy my credit card.

00:26:05.605 --> 00:26:08.775
[whispering] I need you
to call 9-1-1 for me.

00:26:09.484 --> 00:26:10.652
[normally] I'm sorry. What?

00:26:10.735 --> 00:26:13.613
[whispering] I need you
to call 9-1-1 for me.

00:26:13.697 --> 00:26:16.408
The man I'm with is an escaped murderer.

00:26:19.869 --> 00:26:22.872
-[normally] You fucking with me?
-[whispering] Please just call 9-1-1.

00:26:22.956 --> 00:26:23.873
[normally] All right.

00:26:25.166 --> 00:26:26.710
I'm calling them right now.

00:26:28.003 --> 00:26:29.296
Yeah, hi.

00:26:29.379 --> 00:26:31.214
I'm calling to report an emergency.

00:26:31.298 --> 00:26:34.050
This is the filling station
out on route seven.

00:26:35.844 --> 00:26:36.803
That's right.

00:26:43.977 --> 00:26:46.313
Yeah. That's right.

00:26:48.481 --> 00:26:49.899
Wanna send somebody down…

00:26:49.983 --> 00:26:51.443
Rosemary, we need to go.

00:27:00.118 --> 00:27:00.952
[gun cocks]

00:27:02.162 --> 00:27:03.204
Let go of her.

00:27:04.414 --> 00:27:07.917
And we're gonna wait here,
the three of us, for the police.

00:27:08.501 --> 00:27:13.006
Young man, I assure you,
you don't want to point that gun at me.

00:27:15.258 --> 00:27:18.803
Sir, if you don't stay where you are,
I will shoot you.

00:27:19.346 --> 00:27:20.472
Please don't.

00:27:22.474 --> 00:27:24.517
You'll only be hurting yourself.

00:27:32.192 --> 00:27:33.818
-[gunshot]
-[Rosemary screams]

00:27:46.039 --> 00:27:47.248
[car engine starts]

00:27:50.418 --> 00:27:52.420
[John] You shouldn't have done that.

00:27:53.380 --> 00:27:55.256
It's my fault for trusting you.

00:27:57.842 --> 00:27:59.094
Are you gonna hurt me?

00:28:02.389 --> 00:28:04.307
Are you taking me to my ruby?

00:28:09.354 --> 00:28:11.398
Then I have no reason to hurt you.

00:28:16.319 --> 00:28:17.612
Until you give me one.

00:28:24.119 --> 00:28:26.913
[Choronzon] Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.

00:28:27.997 --> 00:28:31.793
Today for your entertainment
and delectation,

00:28:31.876 --> 00:28:33.336
a formal challenge.

00:28:33.420 --> 00:28:35.171
[demons cheering]

00:28:35.255 --> 00:28:37.716
The challenger is Dream.

00:28:38.717 --> 00:28:42.220
Once the Master of the Realm of Sleep.

00:28:42.929 --> 00:28:43.888
[caws]

00:28:43.972 --> 00:28:46.599
As the challenged,
I've selected my champion,

00:28:47.267 --> 00:28:51.563
Ruler of Hell, Lucifer Morningstar…

00:28:51.646 --> 00:28:53.231
[demons cheering]

00:28:55.233 --> 00:29:02.073
…to represent me in a contest of skill,
confidence and transformation.

00:29:02.991 --> 00:29:04.075
The oldest game.

00:29:07.746 --> 00:29:10.123
Matthew, I need you
to return to The Dreaming.

00:29:10.206 --> 00:29:11.374
What? No!

00:29:11.458 --> 00:29:13.209
It's the only reason
I allowed you to come.

00:29:13.293 --> 00:29:14.502
So I could leave you?

00:29:14.586 --> 00:29:16.004
If I should not be able to leave,

00:29:16.087 --> 00:29:18.882
I would not have Lucienne left alone
with no word of my fate.

00:29:20.133 --> 00:29:21.259
Not again.

00:29:21.342 --> 00:29:24.804
-The sand will take you back.
-I'm not going back.

00:29:24.888 --> 00:29:28.850
Morpheus, am I interrupting
a preliminary bout of some kind?

00:29:28.933 --> 00:29:32.228
Just a ringside pep talk, Your Majesty.

00:29:32.896 --> 00:29:37.400
We came here for the helm
and we're not leaving here without it.

00:29:37.984 --> 00:29:39.360
We shall see.

00:29:47.577 --> 00:29:48.578
[cheering continues]

00:29:58.963 --> 00:30:00.590
[Lucifer] As the challenged,

00:30:01.424 --> 00:30:07.096
I set the meter and take the first move.

00:30:09.224 --> 00:30:10.183
Very well.

00:30:13.353 --> 00:30:14.854
Make your move.

00:30:18.191 --> 00:30:19.192
I am…

00:30:20.902 --> 00:30:22.821
a dire wolf.

00:30:23.613 --> 00:30:26.908
Prey-stalking, lethal prowler.

00:30:26.991 --> 00:30:27.867
[growls]

00:30:30.829 --> 00:30:32.372
I am a hunter.

00:30:33.498 --> 00:30:37.752
Horse-mounted, wolf-stabbing.

00:30:38.419 --> 00:30:39.712
[snarls]

00:30:39.796 --> 00:30:41.047
[grunts]

00:30:44.968 --> 00:30:46.553
[breathing heavily]

00:30:55.478 --> 00:30:59.399
I am a serpent.

00:30:59.482 --> 00:31:01.192
Horse-biting…

00:31:02.110 --> 00:31:05.989
-[neighing in alarm]
-…poison-toothed.

00:31:06.072 --> 00:31:07.073
[gasps]

00:31:12.954 --> 00:31:14.330
I am a bird of prey.

00:31:14.914 --> 00:31:19.043
Snake-devouring, talons ripping.

00:31:19.544 --> 00:31:20.378
[Lucifer gasps]

00:31:30.013 --> 00:31:35.643
I am a butcher bacterium.

00:31:37.061 --> 00:31:39.814
Warm-life destroying.

00:31:39.898 --> 00:31:41.149
[Dream grunts]

00:31:49.908 --> 00:31:53.453
I am a world.

00:31:54.704 --> 00:31:59.250
Space-floating, life-nurturing.

00:32:02.420 --> 00:32:04.923
I am a nova.

00:32:05.548 --> 00:32:08.593
All-exploding, planet-cremating.

00:32:09.594 --> 00:32:11.220
[screaming]

00:32:21.898 --> 00:32:22.982
[Dream groans]

00:32:28.196 --> 00:32:30.406
[weakly] I am a universe.

00:32:31.449 --> 00:32:36.955
All things encompassing,
all life embracing.

00:32:39.457 --> 00:32:42.877
[Lucifer] I am anti-life.

00:32:46.422 --> 00:32:48.841
The Beast of Judgement.

00:32:51.427 --> 00:32:55.848
The dark at the end of everything.

00:33:05.525 --> 00:33:07.652
What will you be then, Dream Lord?

00:33:07.735 --> 00:33:09.445
[breath trembling]

00:33:13.741 --> 00:33:14.701
[groans weakly]

00:33:14.784 --> 00:33:15.702
I…

00:33:19.539 --> 00:33:20.581
I…

00:33:23.376 --> 00:33:24.419
I …

00:33:26.421 --> 00:33:27.463
[Matthew] Boss?

00:33:28.381 --> 00:33:30.675
Hey, boss!

00:33:30.758 --> 00:33:32.593
Still with us, Dream?

00:33:32.677 --> 00:33:36.264
He is and it's his move, Your Majesty.

00:33:36.347 --> 00:33:38.099
There are no more moves.

00:33:39.017 --> 00:33:41.394
What can survive the anti-life?

00:33:42.228 --> 00:33:46.441
Hey, boss. Listen to me.
You know what can survive the anti-life?

00:33:46.983 --> 00:33:47.942
You.

00:33:48.484 --> 00:33:50.695
Dreams don't fucking die.

00:33:50.778 --> 00:33:51.904
Not if you believe in them,

00:33:51.988 --> 00:33:57.535
and I believe Dream of the Endless
would never leave his raven here alone,

00:33:57.618 --> 00:34:00.413
in Hell with Lucifer.

00:34:04.625 --> 00:34:05.668
I…

00:34:08.129 --> 00:34:09.088
am…

00:34:12.383 --> 00:34:13.426
[caws]

00:34:19.640 --> 00:34:20.516
hope.

00:34:32.236 --> 00:34:33.112
Hope.

00:34:38.910 --> 00:34:40.244
[Dream] Well, Lightbringer?

00:34:41.746 --> 00:34:42.955
It's your move.

00:34:44.123 --> 00:34:46.584
What is it that kills hope?

00:34:51.672 --> 00:34:53.424
Choronzon, give him his helm.

00:34:55.343 --> 00:34:56.177
[Choronzon] No.

00:34:58.012 --> 00:34:58.846
I won't.

00:34:59.388 --> 00:35:01.682
It's mine. Please.

00:35:05.269 --> 00:35:06.354
[Choronzon grunting]

00:35:08.231 --> 00:35:09.857
[demons cheering]

00:35:12.318 --> 00:35:13.736
[Choronzon screams]

00:35:13.820 --> 00:35:15.822
[demons cheering]

00:35:37.218 --> 00:35:38.469
Thank you, Mazikeen.

00:35:45.518 --> 00:35:46.644
Thank you, Lightbringer.

00:35:47.228 --> 00:35:49.730
The Ruler of Hell is honorable, indeed.

00:35:49.814 --> 00:35:51.399
I will not forget this.

00:35:52.775 --> 00:35:53.943
Honorable?

00:35:56.320 --> 00:35:58.239
You joke, surely.

00:36:00.324 --> 00:36:01.826
Look out there, Morpheus.

00:36:02.994 --> 00:36:06.414
The billion Lords of Hell
stand arrayed about you.

00:36:07.748 --> 00:36:08.833
Tell us.

00:36:10.585 --> 00:36:12.545
Why should we let you leave?

00:36:13.129 --> 00:36:15.923
Helmet or no, you have no power here.

00:36:16.007 --> 00:36:17.133
After all…

00:36:18.634 --> 00:36:23.639
What power have dreams in Hell?

00:36:26.392 --> 00:36:28.644
You say I have no power here.

00:36:31.272 --> 00:36:32.732
Perhaps you speak truly.

00:36:34.942 --> 00:36:38.154
But to say dreams have no power in Hell…

00:36:40.615 --> 00:36:42.867
Tell me, Lucifer Morningstar,

00:36:43.743 --> 00:36:46.829
what power would Hell have
if those here imprisoned

00:36:46.913 --> 00:36:48.206
were not able to dream…

00:36:51.792 --> 00:36:52.752
of Heaven?

00:37:02.428 --> 00:37:03.971
One day, Morpheus…

00:37:07.475 --> 00:37:09.310
we shall destroy you.

00:37:13.064 --> 00:37:14.982
Until that day, Lightbringer.

00:37:28.746 --> 00:37:30.373
[cheering continues]

00:37:51.560 --> 00:37:53.646
[Matthew] You think
Lucifer will come after you?

00:37:53.729 --> 00:37:54.772
[Dream] Why?

00:37:54.855 --> 00:37:58.109
[Matthew] Because you just
publicly humiliated the Ruler of Hell.

00:38:03.364 --> 00:38:05.199
Can you even see in that thing?

00:38:05.283 --> 00:38:06.242
[Dream] I can.

00:38:07.368 --> 00:38:08.953
I can see the ruby.

00:38:55.416 --> 00:38:56.500
Something's wrong.

00:38:57.460 --> 00:38:58.836
Someone's altered it.

00:39:03.841 --> 00:39:04.759
[Rosemary] This is it?

00:39:05.259 --> 00:39:07.345
Yes. Thank you.

00:40:06.362 --> 00:40:08.697
-[door creaks shut]
-[Matthew groans]

00:40:09.573 --> 00:40:10.408
[lock clicks]

00:40:25.548 --> 00:40:26.924
What are you still doing here?

00:40:28.592 --> 00:40:30.511
I know I'm gonna regret this but…

00:40:31.971 --> 00:40:33.639
Do you need a ride somewhere?

00:40:36.892 --> 00:40:39.645
Do you really want me
to get back into that truck?

00:40:39.728 --> 00:40:41.313
The truth. No lies.

00:40:43.399 --> 00:40:44.358
I wanna go home.

00:40:46.152 --> 00:40:48.362
You're a good person, Rosemary.

00:40:50.531 --> 00:40:55.453
Unfortunately, good people
seldom survive in this world.

00:40:58.038 --> 00:41:00.583
Just don't hurt Susie, please.

00:41:00.666 --> 00:41:02.626
I don't care what happens to me but…

00:41:05.379 --> 00:41:06.297
Here.

00:41:07.423 --> 00:41:08.466
Take it.

00:41:10.843 --> 00:41:12.011
Wear it.

00:41:14.388 --> 00:41:18.350
From now on,
no one will be able to hurt you.

00:41:18.434 --> 00:41:19.560
Not even me.

00:41:20.227 --> 00:41:23.314
There's no need to be afraid
or tell a lie ever again.

00:41:25.691 --> 00:41:26.859
Don't you need it?

00:41:26.942 --> 00:41:30.988
No. I have my ruby.

00:41:32.406 --> 00:41:34.950
Boss. Boss!

00:41:35.034 --> 00:41:37.244
[John] The ruby makes dreams come true.

00:41:39.747 --> 00:41:44.460
And I'm going to use it to save the world.

00:41:52.510 --> 00:41:54.512
