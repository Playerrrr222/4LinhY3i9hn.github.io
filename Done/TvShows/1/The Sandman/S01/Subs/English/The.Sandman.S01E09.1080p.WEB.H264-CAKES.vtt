00:00:11.011 --> 00:00:13.013
[somber music playing]

00:00:29.904 --> 00:00:32.574
So, I've been having these dreams.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.289
And last night, I dreamed I found Jed.

00:00:41.166 --> 00:00:43.251
And he told me

00:00:44.085 --> 00:00:47.797
who his foster parents are
and where they live.

00:00:49.883 --> 00:00:52.844
So, when I woke up this morning,
I went there.

00:00:53.511 --> 00:00:55.889
But when I got there…

00:00:58.725 --> 00:00:59.726
Jed was gone.

00:01:03.146 --> 00:01:04.898
And they were dead.

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:09.110
I know it's hard to believe, but--

00:01:09.194 --> 00:01:10.528
[Lyta] I believe you.

00:01:11.362 --> 00:01:15.575
Because last night, I had a dream
that I spent the night with Hector.

00:01:16.284 --> 00:01:19.454
And when I woke up this morning…

00:01:23.208 --> 00:01:24.417
Oh, my God.

00:01:25.376 --> 00:01:26.211
I know.

00:01:28.588 --> 00:01:29.547
Is it real?

00:01:31.091 --> 00:01:32.258
Feel it.

00:01:37.847 --> 00:01:40.058
-Oh, my God.
-I know.

00:01:41.726 --> 00:01:43.144
[caws]

00:01:44.604 --> 00:01:46.189
What is happening to us?

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:51.778
I think I know the answer to that.

00:01:54.614 --> 00:01:55.865
I think it's me.

00:01:57.242 --> 00:01:58.785
[caws]

00:02:04.499 --> 00:02:07.335
I don't know how she did it,
but Rose just got Lyta pregnant.

00:02:08.211 --> 00:02:09.295
What?

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:12.298
Apparently it happened in her dream,
and when Lyta woke up--

00:02:12.382 --> 00:02:15.385
-She was still pregnant.
-Very much so.

00:02:15.468 --> 00:02:16.594
Then it's starting.

00:02:17.679 --> 00:02:19.889
Rose is weakening
the walls between the realms.

00:02:20.473 --> 00:02:22.058
[caws] You gonna tell the boss?

00:02:23.893 --> 00:02:25.645
-No.
-"No"?

00:02:25.728 --> 00:02:27.147
It's none of my business.

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:28.523
Uh, since when?

00:02:28.606 --> 00:02:33.236
Since Lord Morpheus reminded me
that I'm merely a librarian

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:35.572
and should concern myself
with my books from now on.

00:02:36.197 --> 00:02:37.782
He said that? [caws]

00:02:37.866 --> 00:02:38.867
He did. So…

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:40.535
What is wrong with him?

00:02:40.618 --> 00:02:42.453
Nothing is wrong with him.

00:02:44.956 --> 00:02:46.374
He's always been this way.

00:02:47.083 --> 00:02:49.377
He's just been away so long I'd forgotten.

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:55.842
He's determined to deal with the vortex
and the missing Arcana by himself.

00:02:55.925 --> 00:02:57.010
Without anyone's help.

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:05.727
So any news must be reported
directly and exclusively to him.

00:03:06.895 --> 00:03:09.564
Okay. But can I keep you in the loop?

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:12.317
You'd better not.

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:18.031
In His Majesty's current mood,
he could banish us both to the Darkness.

00:03:18.114 --> 00:03:19.282
As he did Gault.

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.660
[Matthew] All right, fine.
I'll go back to spying on Rose.

00:03:22.744 --> 00:03:24.245
But you should make up with him.

00:03:25.205 --> 00:03:27.081
I should make up with him?

00:03:27.165 --> 00:03:30.877
Yes. [caws]
Now's not the time to be fighting,

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:33.588
not when there's a vortex
getting people pregnant

00:03:33.671 --> 00:03:36.216
and runaway Nightmares
doing God knows what.

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:39.177
[sighs]

00:03:41.638 --> 00:03:42.472
Mm.

00:03:42.555 --> 00:03:44.432
[faint music playing]

00:03:44.515 --> 00:03:46.684
[chuckles]

00:03:46.768 --> 00:03:47.810
You want another one?

00:03:49.896 --> 00:03:51.314
Don't we have to meet Rose?

00:03:51.397 --> 00:03:54.108
-No, Rose is coming to meet us.
-Here?

00:03:54.192 --> 00:03:56.569
No. I have to go to a work thing.

00:03:56.653 --> 00:03:57.612
It's a convention.

00:03:57.695 --> 00:04:00.698
-We'll call her from there.
-Like a comic book convention?

00:04:01.574 --> 00:04:02.909
You like comic books?

00:04:03.868 --> 00:04:04.702
I used to.

00:04:04.786 --> 00:04:06.454
Back when you were a kid?

00:04:06.537 --> 00:04:07.664
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

00:04:10.416 --> 00:04:12.252
-Can I ask you a question?
-Shoot.

00:04:13.378 --> 00:04:14.379
What's your name?

00:04:16.089 --> 00:04:20.343
Have you ever noticed
how people only ever use your name

00:04:20.426 --> 00:04:22.428
when you're in trouble… Jed?

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.682
"We need to talk, Jed."

00:04:26.391 --> 00:04:28.017
"Get in here, Jed."

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:32.397
You sound like my Uncle Barnaby.

00:04:33.106 --> 00:04:37.026
-Exactly.
-He's gonna come looking for me.

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:39.445
No, he's not.

00:04:39.529 --> 00:04:42.699
He always comes looking for me.

00:04:42.782 --> 00:04:45.159
Hmm, not this time.

00:04:48.663 --> 00:04:49.831
Do you run away a lot?

00:04:51.291 --> 00:04:53.209
-Hmm.
-I do too.

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:55.295
And I'll tell you a secret.

00:04:57.922 --> 00:05:00.675
[softly] I'm running away right now.

00:05:02.844 --> 00:05:03.886
You are?

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:06.389
And once we get to Rose,
we don't have to run anymore.

00:05:07.724 --> 00:05:09.142
We'll be home free.

00:05:10.935 --> 00:05:12.687
Are you ready to meet your sister?

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:13.604
Yeah.

00:05:15.148 --> 00:05:17.692
Well, then let's go. Come on.

00:05:20.486 --> 00:05:21.362
You wanna drive?

00:05:23.156 --> 00:05:24.824
Ah! [chuckles]

00:05:26.534 --> 00:05:28.328
This is all my fault.

00:05:28.411 --> 00:05:31.122
Because you're a dream vortex?

00:05:31.205 --> 00:05:35.335
I don't know how I'm doing it
or even when I'm doing it,

00:05:37.045 --> 00:05:40.715
but I promise you… I will fix this.

00:05:41.716 --> 00:05:43.509
I will make it go away.

00:05:43.593 --> 00:05:45.595
No, you won't.

00:05:46.804 --> 00:05:50.308
Look, whatever's happening,
however it's happening,

00:05:50.391 --> 00:05:52.602
our dreams are coming true.

00:05:52.685 --> 00:05:54.812
You found Jed in your dreams.

00:05:55.396 --> 00:05:57.106
And I found Hector.

00:05:59.067 --> 00:06:00.068
In fact, uh…

00:06:02.278 --> 00:06:03.863
he's asked me to live with him there.

00:06:04.655 --> 00:06:05.490
Where?

00:06:06.616 --> 00:06:08.409
In your dreams?

00:06:10.787 --> 00:06:12.580
How? That's impossible.

00:06:12.663 --> 00:06:17.418
I have no idea.
I mean, if this can happen, I have to try.

00:06:18.586 --> 00:06:23.257
So, you'd just… give up on your life here?

00:06:23.883 --> 00:06:26.135
-What life?
-Don't say that.

00:06:26.219 --> 00:06:27.345
It's true, though.

00:06:28.721 --> 00:06:32.517
And… you can always visit.

00:06:34.977 --> 00:06:35.895
How?

00:06:35.978 --> 00:06:39.399
The same way
you found Jed and I found Hector.

00:06:40.691 --> 00:06:42.235
In your dreams.

-Hello?
-[Corinthian] Hi.

00:06:52.453 --> 00:06:54.789
I'm calling because
I found one of your flyers.

00:06:54.872 --> 00:06:56.374
-About a missing boy?
-Yes?

["Skeletons" playing on stereo]

00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.544
I think I found him.

-Rose?
-Jed?

00:07:04.632 --> 00:07:06.759
-Hi!
-[Rose] Hi.

00:07:06.843 --> 00:07:09.595
I… I can't believe it.
Are you okay? Where are you?

00:07:10.179 --> 00:07:12.598
We're at a hotel in Georgia.
Can you come get me?

00:07:12.682 --> 00:07:14.559
[Rose] Yes. I'm leaving right now, Jeddy.

00:07:15.143 --> 00:07:16.811
Tell me the name of the hotel.

00:07:16.894 --> 00:07:18.896
[music continues]

00:07:22.733 --> 00:07:24.735
[Jed] The Royal Empire Hotel.

00:07:24.819 --> 00:07:26.529
[Rose] Royal Empire Hotel.

00:07:32.493 --> 00:07:35.621
You're about three hours from here.
Is that okay?

00:07:35.705 --> 00:07:37.248
She's three hours away.

00:07:37.331 --> 00:07:38.416
I'll answer to her.

00:07:39.167 --> 00:07:43.254
Rose. Take your time. Just call us
at this number when you get here.

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:47.008
Thank you. Oh. I almost forgot.
What's your name?

-It's a cereal convention.

Go. I'll be fine.

Our esteemed landlord tells me
we're running low on these.

00:10:23.039 --> 00:10:24.832
Actually, we don't need them anymore.

00:10:24.915 --> 00:10:27.376
I just got a call. Someone found Jed.

00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:28.419
What? Where?

00:10:28.502 --> 00:10:31.088
He's at a hotel in Georgia.
I'm on my way there now.

00:10:31.172 --> 00:10:33.049
You're not going alone, I hope.

00:10:33.799 --> 00:10:36.385
Uh, Lyta's not feeling well, so…

00:10:37.011 --> 00:10:38.846
You must allow me to accompany you.

00:10:38.929 --> 00:10:43.142
Uh, I believe America is a very large
and excitable place,

00:10:43.225 --> 00:10:46.604
and a young person traveling alone
can get into all kind of scrapes.

00:10:46.687 --> 00:10:48.189
As witnessed the other night.

00:10:49.106 --> 00:10:50.816
That's very generous of you, but--

00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:52.610
If you'll indulge me,

00:10:52.693 --> 00:10:56.280
I should rather enjoy the role
of amateur knight errant.

I have my swordstick
and an ancient but serviceable revolver.

00:11:00.076 --> 00:11:03.788
All right. But where we're going,
we won't need to defend ourselves.

00:11:04.664 --> 00:11:07.416
I, uh, actually got to meet him once.

00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:08.709
You met the Big Bad Wolf?

Hey. Fun.

Fun Land. Not "Fun." Fun Land.

00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:24.975
Got it. Sorry about that.

-That's okay.
-I see you've met my young friend.

00:11:28.771 --> 00:11:30.022
-[chuckles]
-[Fun Land] Oh.

00:11:30.106 --> 00:11:31.315
Is he with you?

00:11:31.399 --> 00:11:32.608
He is.

00:11:32.692 --> 00:11:35.903
He and his sister are my guests
and under my protection.

00:11:38.864 --> 00:11:39.782
Are we good?

00:11:42.910 --> 00:11:44.662
We are. Yeah. We're good.

00:11:45.871 --> 00:11:47.957
Glad to hear it. Come on, Jed.

00:11:49.291 --> 00:11:50.292
Nice to meet you.

00:11:52.753 --> 00:11:54.463
[sighs heavily]

00:11:54.547 --> 00:11:56.340
[classical music playing]

00:11:56.424 --> 00:11:59.343
-[Rose] You sure you don't mind driving?
-[Gilbert] No. Not at all.

00:11:59.427 --> 00:12:04.140
When I left home, I made it my mission
to see as much of this world as possible.

00:12:04.765 --> 00:12:07.560
And home is England? You sound English.

00:12:08.894 --> 00:12:10.104
Thank you.

00:12:11.605 --> 00:12:14.442
Just, you know, to me,
the object of travel

00:12:14.525 --> 00:12:16.861
is not to set foot in a foreign land,

00:12:16.944 --> 00:12:21.991
but at last to set foot
in your own country as a foreign land.

00:12:22.908 --> 00:12:24.285
So, it's all about going home?

00:12:25.244 --> 00:12:27.913
Yes. I, I suppose it must be, in the end.

00:12:28.789 --> 00:12:33.085
And, and you and Miss Hall will be
going home, I assume. Uh, with Jed?

00:12:33.669 --> 00:12:36.672
Uh, Lyta has other plans, actually.

00:12:36.756 --> 00:12:39.216
Oh, yes, you said that, um,
she wasn't feeling very well.

00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:40.509
Is everything all right?

00:12:41.135 --> 00:12:42.178
I hope so.

00:12:47.308 --> 00:12:49.310
[Lyta softly moaning]

00:13:05.242 --> 00:13:06.786
Are you sure this is okay?

00:13:08.704 --> 00:13:09.663
Very sure.

00:13:13.501 --> 00:13:15.503
-[rumbling]
-[objects clattering]

00:13:24.804 --> 00:13:25.930
What was that?

00:13:29.308 --> 00:13:30.726
Uh…

00:13:30.810 --> 00:13:32.019
An earthquake.

00:13:35.773 --> 00:13:37.066
I'll be right back.

00:13:38.567 --> 00:13:39.401
[sighs]

00:13:41.487 --> 00:13:43.614
This has never happened before, I promise.

00:13:44.281 --> 00:13:45.282
I believe you.

00:13:51.121 --> 00:13:52.957
[chuckles] It's fine.

00:13:53.999 --> 00:13:56.210
I guess if earthquakes
happen in real life,

00:13:56.877 --> 00:13:58.963
they can happen in dreams too, right?

00:13:59.046 --> 00:14:01.423
Yeah. We call those nightmares.

00:14:02.049 --> 00:14:03.008
Come here.

00:14:06.220 --> 00:14:08.305
Does this look like a nightmare to you?

00:14:09.849 --> 00:14:10.850
Not at all.

00:14:23.737 --> 00:14:25.739
[ominous music playing]

00:14:26.866 --> 00:14:28.868
[distant cracking]

00:14:41.881 --> 00:14:44.341
Loosh? You in here?

00:14:44.425 --> 00:14:48.012
Whoops. Oh, sorry, boss.
I was looking for Lucienne.

00:14:48.095 --> 00:14:49.471
-See ya.
-Wait.

00:14:53.559 --> 00:14:55.019
Why were you looking for Lucienne?

00:14:55.102 --> 00:14:59.690
Oh, well, we just had some
minor seismic activity

00:14:59.773 --> 00:15:02.484
and a little, you know,
damage I wanted to report.

00:15:02.568 --> 00:15:04.361
Then why not report it to me?

00:15:04.945 --> 00:15:07.448
Uh, because you're busy?

00:15:07.531 --> 00:15:10.868
While you were away, Lucienne started
taking care of that stuff,

00:15:10.951 --> 00:15:13.078
so I figured…
[chuckles] why bother you when--

00:15:13.162 --> 00:15:17.041
Mervyn, if The Dreaming
has been damaged in any way,

00:15:17.917 --> 00:15:19.752
I will be the one to address it.

00:15:19.835 --> 00:15:21.921
[rumbling]

00:15:22.004 --> 00:15:24.006
[cracking]

00:15:25.257 --> 00:15:27.134
Oh, for crying out loud.

00:15:31.305 --> 00:15:33.933
You want me to fix that for you?

00:15:34.016 --> 00:15:36.560
Or will it just keep happening?

00:15:36.644 --> 00:15:39.188
It will not keep happening

00:15:40.189 --> 00:15:42.775
because I will find
the cause of the disturbance

00:15:42.858 --> 00:15:44.485
and I will eliminate it.

00:15:45.611 --> 00:15:47.905
-Thank you, Mervyn.
-Uh, you're welcome.

00:16:05.756 --> 00:16:06.632
[Dream] Lucienne?

00:16:09.635 --> 00:16:10.844
My lord.

00:16:10.928 --> 00:16:12.554
I have come to return these…

00:16:14.890 --> 00:16:18.227
and to assess the extent of the damage
from the recent disturbances.

00:16:24.191 --> 00:16:29.738
Have… you any idea as to what caused them?

00:16:32.032 --> 00:16:34.243
-I assumed it was you, sir.
-Me?

00:16:34.743 --> 00:16:40.082
Making further improvements
to the realm… now that you're back.

00:16:42.501 --> 00:16:44.211
Lucienne, when we last spoke,

00:16:44.294 --> 00:16:48.424
I did not mean to imply that your efforts
beyond the library are without value.

00:16:48.507 --> 00:16:49.341
Oh?

00:16:49.425 --> 00:16:51.593
I really wish to
relieve you of responsibilities

00:16:51.677 --> 00:16:54.847
with which, had I been here,
you would never have been burdened.

00:16:55.556 --> 00:16:56.598
I see.

00:16:56.682 --> 00:17:00.019
And… in that time,

00:17:00.102 --> 00:17:06.567
did you experience any…
similar seismic disturbances?

00:17:07.192 --> 00:17:08.444
I did not.

00:17:13.699 --> 00:17:16.827
Have you any… theory as to their origin?

00:17:18.829 --> 00:17:22.374
Speaking strictly as a librarian? I do.

00:17:22.958 --> 00:17:24.543
-But you won't like it.
-Go on.

00:17:25.794 --> 00:17:27.755
I know you're waiting to see

00:17:27.838 --> 00:17:31.175
if the vortex will lead you
to The Corinthian and Fiddler's Green.

00:17:31.258 --> 00:17:33.719
-The way she led you to Gault.
-She may yet still.

00:17:33.802 --> 00:17:37.306
Yes, but while you're waiting,
she's putting cracks in the foundation.

00:17:38.015 --> 00:17:40.726
Rose Walker has visited
this realm before and done no damage.

00:17:40.809 --> 00:17:42.811
-This is something else, something new.
-Perhaps.

00:17:43.729 --> 00:17:47.858
But if there is something new
in The Dreaming and you did not create it,

00:17:48.734 --> 00:17:50.235
how did it get here?

00:17:51.278 --> 00:17:54.114
This is the vortex. I assure you.

00:17:57.951 --> 00:18:00.037
I can't thank you enough, Unity.

00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:02.247
[Unity] You did all the work, Rose, love.

00:18:02.873 --> 00:18:06.043
May I ask Mr. Holdaway to send tickets?

00:18:06.126 --> 00:18:07.086
Bring you both over?

00:18:07.795 --> 00:18:09.379
I'd love that. Thank you.

00:18:10.297 --> 00:18:13.884
I'll ask him to see about
making you Jed's legal guardian.

00:18:13.967 --> 00:18:16.428
So no one can take Jed away again.

00:18:16.512 --> 00:18:17.805
Would that be all right?

00:18:17.888 --> 00:18:19.431
Yes! Thank you, Unity.

00:18:20.057 --> 00:18:21.725
Thank Mr. Holdaway for me too.

00:18:22.267 --> 00:18:23.519
Thank you, Rose, love.

00:18:27.189 --> 00:18:29.274
I'll contact my associates in the US.

00:18:30.192 --> 00:18:31.902
What if they were to live here?

00:18:32.486 --> 00:18:34.279
-Here?
-In London.

00:18:35.155 --> 00:18:36.490
You could find us a house.

00:18:37.074 --> 00:18:40.202
Rose could write, Jed would go to school.

00:18:41.703 --> 00:18:43.080
I could adopt them.

00:18:43.664 --> 00:18:45.165
-At your age?
-[scoffs]

00:18:46.458 --> 00:18:49.169
Be happy for me, Mr. Holdaway.

00:18:51.421 --> 00:18:53.173
I'm going to have a life after all.

00:18:54.633 --> 00:18:56.301
[Gilbert] You're going to London?

00:18:56.385 --> 00:18:58.929
And I'm gonna be
Jed's legal guardian from now on.

00:18:59.012 --> 00:19:03.559
I must say,
that's very grown-up, Rose Walker.

00:19:04.852 --> 00:19:06.103
It is, isn't it?

00:19:07.855 --> 00:19:10.315
-What's wrong?
-Well, what if Jed and I…

00:19:11.483 --> 00:19:13.569
-What if he doesn't like me?
-[chuckling]

00:19:13.652 --> 00:19:15.445
Or worse, what if I don't like him?

00:19:16.029 --> 00:19:18.657
-What?
-I'm just so impressed.

00:19:19.366 --> 00:19:23.579
You allowed yourself to be happy
for nearly a minute there

00:19:23.662 --> 00:19:26.707
before inventing some
new problems for yourself.

00:19:26.790 --> 00:19:28.000
I'm just nervous.

00:19:28.625 --> 00:19:30.502
I haven't seen him since he was five.

00:19:31.461 --> 00:19:34.715
The only thing I remember about him
is he used to love chicken fingers.

00:19:34.798 --> 00:19:37.217
That's all he'd eat for every meal.

00:19:38.218 --> 00:19:40.345
He's probably completely different now.

00:19:40.929 --> 00:19:43.140
[indistinct chatter on TV]

00:19:43.223 --> 00:19:47.394
Your sister will be here in a few hours
and I need you to do me a favor

00:19:47.477 --> 00:19:49.855
and just stay in the room
until she gets here, okay?

00:19:49.938 --> 00:19:52.900
-I can't go with you?
-No. No, no. Trust me, you don't want to.

00:19:52.983 --> 00:19:55.694
It's just a bunch of
boring grown-ups down there.

00:19:55.777 --> 00:19:57.029
Then why are you going?

00:19:57.112 --> 00:19:59.948
I'm going to make it… less boring.

00:20:00.657 --> 00:20:04.870
So, I'll see you in a couple hours.
And do not open this door.

00:20:04.953 --> 00:20:06.830
I won't, unless it's you.

00:20:06.914 --> 00:20:10.000
Okay. We gotta keep you safe, Jed Walker.

00:20:10.083 --> 00:20:11.043
[elevator dings]

00:20:12.794 --> 00:20:13.712
[door opens]

00:20:15.339 --> 00:20:16.173
[door closes]

00:20:27.768 --> 00:20:29.770
[indistinct chatter]

00:20:51.458 --> 00:20:52.834
[clears throat]

00:20:54.086 --> 00:20:56.630
-Hello. [chuckles]
-[all] Hello.

00:20:56.713 --> 00:20:58.382
[Nimrod] Thank you all for being here.

00:20:59.549 --> 00:21:01.677
Yeah, uh… [clears throat]

00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:05.222
I heard a story recently, uh,
I thought might amuse you.

00:21:08.475 --> 00:21:12.604
It seems that
the telephone rang in a police station.

00:21:12.688 --> 00:21:16.733
Uh, the duty cop answers,
and a woman's voice says,

00:21:16.817 --> 00:21:18.694
"Help. I've been reaped."

00:21:19.611 --> 00:21:22.823
The cop says, "Don't you mean 'raped'?"

00:21:23.448 --> 00:21:26.493
"No," she says, "He used a scythe."

00:21:27.995 --> 00:21:29.204
[all laugh]

00:21:30.163 --> 00:21:31.415
[chuckles]

00:21:33.417 --> 00:21:34.751
[Fun Land laughs]

00:21:37.087 --> 00:21:39.506
So it's really good
to see so many of us here,

00:21:40.424 --> 00:21:43.844
so many familiar faces
and, uh, new faces too.

00:21:43.927 --> 00:21:46.555
For those of you
joining us for the first time,

00:21:46.638 --> 00:21:49.850
there are a few rules we must adhere to.

00:21:49.933 --> 00:21:54.938
Firstly, use the sobriquet you provided

00:21:55.022 --> 00:21:57.232
which has been printed on your name tag.

00:21:57.316 --> 00:22:00.027
No civilian names.

00:22:00.736 --> 00:22:04.406
Secondly, uh, we don't shit where we eat.

00:22:04.489 --> 00:22:08.744
So nobody does any collecting
until the convention's over

00:22:08.827 --> 00:22:10.954
and you're at least 200 miles away.

00:22:11.038 --> 00:22:12.331
Aw.

00:22:12.414 --> 00:22:13.749
[laughter]

00:22:19.212 --> 00:22:21.965
Thirdly, on an unfortunate note,

00:22:22.049 --> 00:22:26.345
The Family Man, who was to have been
our guest speaker this year,

00:22:27.095 --> 00:22:28.680
has not been able to make it.

00:22:28.764 --> 00:22:31.183
[audience groans] No. Come on.

00:22:31.767 --> 00:22:37.314
But… every cloud has a silver lining,

00:22:37.397 --> 00:22:40.525
and it gives me great pleasure

00:22:40.609 --> 00:22:45.238
to be able to present
our new guest of honor.

00:22:46.073 --> 00:22:48.658
Gentlemen, ladies…

00:22:50.952 --> 00:22:52.371
The Corinthian.

00:22:52.454 --> 00:22:54.164
[all exclaiming]

00:22:55.457 --> 00:22:56.458
[chuckles]

00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:23.193
[Nimrod] The Corinthian's keynote address

00:23:23.276 --> 00:23:25.445
will be in this room
immediately after dinner.

00:23:25.529 --> 00:23:29.533
Before that,
we have our cocktail reception.

00:23:30.367 --> 00:23:33.662
And our first three panels
to kick off the weekend.

00:23:33.745 --> 00:23:36.331
The "Make It Pay" panel will be in Hall A…

00:23:36.415 --> 00:23:39.084
[Gilbert] What fascinates me
about humanity

00:23:39.793 --> 00:23:44.256
is that so many people
are looking for reasons to be unhappy.

00:23:44.881 --> 00:23:47.717
It's only when they're mired
in their self-made misery

00:23:47.801 --> 00:23:50.095
that they are truly content.

00:23:52.889 --> 00:23:54.141
I'm boring you.

00:23:54.224 --> 00:23:55.684
Not at all.

00:23:55.767 --> 00:23:57.853
Oh, good. Because I do love a paradox.

00:23:57.936 --> 00:23:59.438
Chesterton did too.

00:23:59.521 --> 00:24:03.275
Take charity for example.
Charity usually means one of two things,

00:24:03.358 --> 00:24:07.028
pardoning an unpardonable act
or loving an unlovable person.

00:24:07.821 --> 00:24:10.323
Or take love. Love's an even better one.

00:24:10.407 --> 00:24:12.868
To love means loving the unlovable.

00:24:13.743 --> 00:24:16.288
To forgive means
pardoning the unpardonable.

00:24:18.540 --> 00:24:21.084
Faith means believing the unbelievable.

00:24:23.003 --> 00:24:29.134
And hope means hoping
even when everything seems hopeless.

00:24:34.514 --> 00:24:35.765
Look at you.

00:24:37.601 --> 00:24:40.020
[Lyta chuckles] I know, I'm huge.

00:24:40.103 --> 00:24:41.563
You're gorgeous.

00:24:41.646 --> 00:24:45.692
I wish this baby would hurry up
and just get here. It's been months.

00:24:46.735 --> 00:24:47.944
It's been two hours.

00:24:49.196 --> 00:24:50.197
No way.

00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:54.075
I guess time moves differently here.

00:24:55.285 --> 00:24:57.120
Come on, let me show you the house.

00:24:57.662 --> 00:24:59.998
I wish you could've seen it
when we moved in.

00:25:00.081 --> 00:25:01.333
[Rose] Why? What's different?

00:25:01.416 --> 00:25:03.251
We've had earthquake damage.

00:25:04.002 --> 00:25:05.670
I'm so glad you're here!

00:25:07.464 --> 00:25:09.758
So what do you think? [caws]

00:25:11.092 --> 00:25:14.387
[Dream] Tell Lucienne she was right
about the source of the tremors.

00:25:16.181 --> 00:25:17.766
And that I'm taking care of it.

00:25:25.607 --> 00:25:27.234
Hector, look who's here.

00:25:31.279 --> 00:25:36.076
Lyta, you remember I told you about
Lord Morpheus, the King of Dreams?

00:25:36.868 --> 00:25:38.245
What do you want?

00:25:39.329 --> 00:25:40.497
He wants us to leave.

00:25:40.580 --> 00:25:41.456
Why?

00:25:41.540 --> 00:25:45.627
Because a ghost cannot
escape his fate by hiding in The Dreaming.

00:25:47.379 --> 00:25:50.131
Nor can a living human being
escape her grief here.

00:25:50.215 --> 00:25:53.927
Do you not see the damage
your presence has done to this realm?

00:25:55.220 --> 00:25:57.180
I cannot allow you to stay.

00:25:57.764 --> 00:25:59.182
Is there anything we can do?

00:25:59.808 --> 00:26:01.351
You belong with the dead.

00:26:01.434 --> 00:26:03.353
You must go
to the place appointed for you.

00:26:06.439 --> 00:26:09.484
I'm sorry, but you must
say your goodbyes now.

00:26:12.028 --> 00:26:15.240
[voice breaking] No.
I'm not losing you again.

00:26:25.083 --> 00:26:26.751
[Hector] I love you so much.

00:26:27.502 --> 00:26:28.878
You're not going anywhere.

00:26:30.005 --> 00:26:31.089
Get out of our house.

00:26:31.172 --> 00:26:32.007
Lyta--

00:26:32.090 --> 00:26:32.966
Enough.

00:26:33.550 --> 00:26:36.761
Tell… Tell the baby I--

00:26:36.845 --> 00:26:37.846
No.

00:26:38.513 --> 00:26:40.307
-Please! Stop.
-[Lyta] Hector?

00:26:40.390 --> 00:26:42.642
-[Rose] Dream, please, stop!
-No!

00:26:42.726 --> 00:26:43.852
Hector!

00:26:46.730 --> 00:26:47.564
[sobbing] No…

00:26:59.367 --> 00:27:02.579
Your husband died a long time ago.
He was a ghost and this is a dream.

00:27:06.499 --> 00:27:08.376
The baby is yours… for now.

00:27:08.460 --> 00:27:09.336
[gasps]

00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:12.672
What do you mean?

00:27:12.756 --> 00:27:14.883
The child was conceived in The Dreaming.

00:27:15.967 --> 00:27:16.801
It is mine.

00:27:16.885 --> 00:27:18.011
What?

00:27:19.721 --> 00:27:22.474
And one day, I will come for it.

00:27:22.557 --> 00:27:24.934
No, you won't. You'll do nothing--

00:27:25.018 --> 00:27:26.061
This dream is over.

00:27:29.856 --> 00:27:33.401
-[Rose] You killed my friend.
-How did you get here?

00:27:33.485 --> 00:27:36.404
In front of his wife,
and then you threaten to take her baby?

00:27:36.488 --> 00:27:38.365
Do you know why this happened?

00:27:39.199 --> 00:27:43.119
A vortex gathering strength
can weaken the walls between dreams.

00:27:43.203 --> 00:27:44.496
I didn't ask for any of this.

00:27:44.579 --> 00:27:46.122
-Even so!
-No!

00:27:46.206 --> 00:27:49.501
I don't want you coming near me
or my friends ever again.

00:27:49.584 --> 00:27:51.252
Rose, listen to me.

00:27:51.336 --> 00:27:52.462
I do listen to you.

00:27:52.545 --> 00:27:57.217
You said that a vortex
can create universes or destroy them.

00:27:57.967 --> 00:28:01.012
So I suggest
you leave my universe the fuck alone.

00:28:01.096 --> 00:28:03.640
-Rose--
-This dream is over.

00:28:03.723 --> 00:28:05.725
[cell phone ringing]

00:28:11.940 --> 00:28:13.566
-Hey, are you okay?
-[crying]

00:28:13.650 --> 00:28:14.776
He took Hector.

00:28:14.859 --> 00:28:16.528
I know. Are you okay?

00:28:16.611 --> 00:28:18.613
Physically, I mean, is everything--

00:28:18.697 --> 00:28:20.115
I'm still pregnant.

00:28:20.198 --> 00:28:21.199
That's good, right?

00:28:21.825 --> 00:28:23.451
He said he would take the baby.

00:28:23.535 --> 00:28:24.494
He won't.

00:28:24.577 --> 00:28:27.706
He's not gonna bother you
or me ever again.

00:28:28.289 --> 00:28:29.374
I promise.

00:28:30.041 --> 00:28:31.084
We're here.

00:28:33.670 --> 00:28:35.547
[Rose] Gilbert and I
just got to the hotel.

00:28:35.630 --> 00:28:38.758
We're gonna grab Jed
and come right back. Okay?

00:28:39.676 --> 00:28:41.177
-Okay.
-See you in a few hours.

00:28:48.727 --> 00:28:50.103
[Gilbert] Is she all right?

00:28:51.062 --> 00:28:53.231
Well, let's find your brother then.

00:28:57.318 --> 00:29:01.406
I'm sorry, but you are too young
and too hot to be The Corinthian.

00:29:01.489 --> 00:29:03.533
[chuckles] You're too kind.

00:29:03.616 --> 00:29:07.287
I've always been curious.
Is the name biblical? A reference to Paul?

00:29:07.370 --> 00:29:09.914
Or to Corinth? The Roman city of vice?

00:29:09.998 --> 00:29:12.167
Or are you just into leather?

00:29:15.462 --> 00:29:17.547
You know, all of the above. [chuckles]

00:29:18.298 --> 00:29:20.258
Would, uh, you excuse me for a second?

00:29:27.432 --> 00:29:29.100
-Hi.
-Hi.

00:29:29.184 --> 00:29:30.059
Oh.

00:29:30.685 --> 00:29:33.021
Sorry for staring. It's just…

00:29:33.605 --> 00:29:35.565
I can't believe you're here. [chuckles]

00:29:35.648 --> 00:29:37.692
-I'm a huge fan.
-Hmm.

00:29:37.776 --> 00:29:41.988
There was this, um, incredibly detailed
article of your work online.

00:29:42.071 --> 00:29:44.991
I don't know if you've seen it.
It's on this blog called "Chaste."

00:29:45.074 --> 00:29:46.201
I'll have to look for it.

00:29:46.284 --> 00:29:48.244
Oh, I could send it to you if you want.

00:29:49.871 --> 00:29:51.456
I'm The Boogieman by the way.

00:29:53.458 --> 00:29:54.876
So I see.

00:29:54.959 --> 00:29:56.461
-[both chuckle]
-[Boogieman] Yeah.

00:29:56.544 --> 00:30:00.340
Say, can I… buy you a drink

00:30:00.423 --> 00:30:03.009
if I promise not to ask
too many annoying questions?

00:30:03.092 --> 00:30:04.803
I don't wanna monopolize you.

00:30:04.886 --> 00:30:06.596
Yeah. Let's get that drink later.

00:30:06.679 --> 00:30:08.139
-I'd love that.
-Yeah.

00:30:09.015 --> 00:30:10.058
[Nimrod chuckles]

00:30:11.309 --> 00:30:13.478
Well, I see you've met The Boogieman.

00:30:13.561 --> 00:30:14.562
[Corinthian] I have.

00:30:16.940 --> 00:30:19.692
And that's… not The Boogieman.

00:30:21.861 --> 00:30:23.071
Are you sure?

00:30:23.154 --> 00:30:27.116
The Boogieman's dead.
He drowned in Louisiana three years ago.

00:30:28.201 --> 00:30:29.577
But how do you know?

00:30:30.829 --> 00:30:31.663
I know.

00:30:33.915 --> 00:30:36.459
We will deal with this immediately.

00:30:36.543 --> 00:30:39.212
He mentioned a blog called "Chaste."

00:30:39.295 --> 00:30:40.964
Leave it with us.

00:30:41.047 --> 00:30:42.757
[The Good Doctor] I'll look into it.

00:30:44.759 --> 00:30:45.802
I'll be right back.

00:31:10.785 --> 00:31:11.828

00:31:13.079 --> 00:31:15.707
Hi, it's Rose Walker. Jed's sister.

00:31:15.790 --> 00:31:19.127
I'm here in the lobby
when you get this. So, thanks.

00:31:19.878 --> 00:31:23.548
So, do we, uh… wait here or, or…

00:31:23.631 --> 00:31:25.383
Well, it can't hurt to look around.

00:31:25.466 --> 00:31:26.342
Right.

00:31:29.304 --> 00:31:32.015
Uh, excuse me, sir, miss?

00:31:32.098 --> 00:31:34.809
I'm sorry, but this area
is for convention attendees only.

00:31:34.893 --> 00:31:38.605
Ooh, the Cereal Convention.
Yes, I saw your signage outside.

00:31:38.688 --> 00:31:40.899
I'm looking for my brother.
I'll run in and out.

00:31:40.982 --> 00:31:42.942
-I can't let you.
-[Rose] I'll be a second.

00:31:43.026 --> 00:31:45.528
There are no kids in the convention area.

00:31:46.404 --> 00:31:47.655
I would know.

00:31:47.739 --> 00:31:50.617
No children at a cereal convention?

00:31:50.700 --> 00:31:53.202
That seems a bit of a missed opportunity

00:31:53.286 --> 00:31:56.456
or is it maybe sort of
more of a porridge and muesli affair?

00:31:56.539 --> 00:31:59.667
D-Do you mind?
I have to check these people in.

00:32:03.504 --> 00:32:06.591
I appear to have
annoyed him with my questions.

00:32:06.674 --> 00:32:10.011
Imagine how annoyed he'd be
if he found out we have these.

00:32:12.138 --> 00:32:13.264
Oh.

00:32:13.348 --> 00:32:16.392
I take it we're attending
the convention then.

00:32:16.476 --> 00:32:19.354
The only thing Jed loved
more than chicken fingers was cereal.

00:32:20.104 --> 00:32:22.607
I'll check the pool,
you check the convention hall,

00:32:22.690 --> 00:32:24.192
and we'll meet back here in 15?

00:32:24.275 --> 00:32:25.234
How exciting!

00:32:25.944 --> 00:32:28.279

[The Choirboy] Even 10Gs per victim
identified isn't too much to ask.

00:32:46.798 --> 00:32:50.051
Thing to remember is that
they'll pay to know for certain.

00:32:51.094 --> 00:32:53.513
Even if the cops don't go with it,
families will.

00:32:54.305 --> 00:32:55.765
The goal is to drag out hope.

00:32:55.848 --> 00:32:58.851
Because they will pay you
for proof that the trophy is alive.

00:32:58.935 --> 00:33:01.938
It's not a ton, but it's usually good
for a few grand at least.

00:33:02.021 --> 00:33:05.650
The extra cash is nice,
but we don't do it for the money.

00:33:05.733 --> 00:33:08.486
We do it because we are called to do it.

00:33:08.569 --> 00:33:10.613

I have to tell you, I am sick and tired

That it is somehow easier for us
because we use our femininity.

00:33:36.806 --> 00:33:39.517
What they really mean is sexuality.

00:33:40.101 --> 00:33:42.895

if you and Jed are in the restaurant.

00:35:44.225 --> 00:35:46.269
Anyway, call me when you get this.

00:35:47.270 --> 00:35:48.521
Where do you hunt?

00:35:48.604 --> 00:35:49.981
I have a great place.

00:35:51.357 --> 00:35:53.359
There are thousands of people there.

00:35:53.442 --> 00:35:57.655
All these beautiful little kids
wandering off on their own, getting lost.

00:35:58.406 --> 00:36:01.742
Always happy to meet someone
who's friendly and kind.

00:36:01.826 --> 00:36:02.660
Yeah.

00:36:02.743 --> 00:36:04.328
There are quiet places to take them to

00:36:04.412 --> 00:36:06.747
where no one will bother you
until you're done.

00:36:06.831 --> 00:36:09.834
And if you can't find any kids
to play with you,

00:36:10.960 --> 00:36:12.545
you can always go on the rides.

00:36:12.628 --> 00:36:13.880
[both chuckle]

00:36:15.882 --> 00:36:16.716
[indistinct chatter]

00:36:17.925 --> 00:36:20.803
[Boogieman] Yeah, that's,
uh, how I started collecting.

00:36:21.596 --> 00:36:23.431
How did you start?

00:36:25.057 --> 00:36:26.100
Porn.

00:36:26.851 --> 00:36:29.103
My dad had a subscription to Playboy.

00:36:29.687 --> 00:36:32.148
I used to lock myself
in the bathroom with them.

00:36:32.231 --> 00:36:37.528
Then hate myself afterwards
and… rip the magazine into shreds.

00:36:39.530 --> 00:36:42.867
Then when I finally had sex
with an actual woman,

00:36:43.409 --> 00:36:44.452
it was…

00:36:46.204 --> 00:36:47.455
awful.

00:36:47.538 --> 00:36:49.415
So I did what I always do.

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:52.293
I ripped her to shreds.

00:36:57.590 --> 00:37:00.009
Uh, may I leave a message for someone?

00:37:00.760 --> 00:37:02.762
The name is Rose Walker.

00:37:03.596 --> 00:37:05.681
Ms. Walker hasn't checked in yet.

00:37:05.765 --> 00:37:07.516
When she does,
I can give her your message.

00:37:07.600 --> 00:37:09.435
No, no, no, but she's not a guest here.

00:37:09.518 --> 00:37:11.479
She has a room reserved.

00:37:12.104 --> 00:37:13.105
Does she?

00:37:17.777 --> 00:37:20.446
C-Can you leave a message
for her, please? From Gilbert.

00:37:21.030 --> 00:37:23.532
Hey, I was just looking for you.

00:37:24.408 --> 00:37:25.326
Do you, um…

00:37:25.952 --> 00:37:29.455
Do you have time
for that drink at the bar now?

00:37:29.538 --> 00:37:30.414
Uh…

00:37:31.290 --> 00:37:34.752
How about we find some place
that's a little bit quieter?

00:37:41.342 --> 00:37:43.261
Uh… Yeah. Okay.

00:37:49.392 --> 00:37:51.644
Hi, I'm looking for my younger brother.

00:37:51.727 --> 00:37:54.438
And I was wondering
if maybe you've seen him?

00:37:59.110 --> 00:38:00.444
Oh, you're Rose Walker.

00:38:01.028 --> 00:38:03.030
I am. Why?

00:38:03.114 --> 00:38:04.907
I have your room key right here.

00:38:05.533 --> 00:38:06.742
-My room key?
-Mm-hmm.

00:38:06.826 --> 00:38:08.035
And a message from Gilbert.

00:38:08.119 --> 00:38:10.454
He says he's very sorry
but he had to go home.

00:38:11.747 --> 00:38:13.457
Um, did he say why?

00:38:13.541 --> 00:38:16.669
No, I'm sorry. But can I have
someone show you to your room?

00:38:18.838 --> 00:38:21.632
No, I can find it. Thank you.

00:38:28.723 --> 00:38:29.598
[Dream] Lucienne?

00:38:31.267 --> 00:38:33.602
My lord.
There's something I must tell you.

00:38:33.686 --> 00:38:35.271
And I will listen.

00:38:35.354 --> 00:38:37.815
But first, you must let me tell you that

00:38:38.816 --> 00:38:39.775
you were right.

00:38:40.901 --> 00:38:44.113
The vortex was responsible
for the damage to our realm,

00:38:44.196 --> 00:38:47.366
and I was… wrong

00:38:47.450 --> 00:38:50.786
to risk our safety in the hope
that she would locate the missing Arcana.

00:38:51.704 --> 00:38:53.581
You were not entirely wrong, sir.

00:38:54.248 --> 00:38:55.958
-She's found them both.
-What?

00:38:56.542 --> 00:38:59.795
The Corinthian and Fiddler's Green?
Where? How do you know?

00:39:00.504 --> 00:39:02.089
Fiddler's Green told me.

00:39:13.059 --> 00:39:15.436
Apologies, lord, for having left.

00:39:16.896 --> 00:39:19.815
Why? Why did you leave?

00:39:21.901 --> 00:39:24.653
I trusted you.
You were the heart of The Dreaming.

00:39:24.737 --> 00:39:26.030
No, sir.

00:39:26.113 --> 00:39:29.909
You were the heart of The Dreaming.
And you were gone.

00:39:30.785 --> 00:39:32.703
I was curious.

00:39:32.787 --> 00:39:35.915
And it turns out that
life as a human contains substance

00:39:35.998 --> 00:39:39.126
I never even imagined when I was here.

00:39:39.794 --> 00:39:44.006
Which is why I've returned
because… he's murdering them.

00:39:44.090 --> 00:39:45.007
The Corinthian?

00:39:45.091 --> 00:39:49.720
He appears to have built up a cult
of worshippers who kill for pleasure,

00:39:49.804 --> 00:39:51.972
endangering the waking world

00:39:52.056 --> 00:39:55.851
and the life
of a friend called Rose Walker.

00:39:55.935 --> 00:39:58.813
The Corinthian has found Rose Walker?

00:39:58.896 --> 00:39:59.980
Yes.

00:40:00.064 --> 00:40:03.401
Can you imagine the damage
he could do with someone like Rose?

00:40:03.484 --> 00:40:05.277
You must tell me where they are.

00:40:06.654 --> 00:40:08.322
[both breathing heavily]

00:40:16.122 --> 00:40:17.164
[door slams]

00:40:19.917 --> 00:40:21.210
[door closes]

00:40:21.293 --> 00:40:22.711
[heels clicking]

00:40:28.926 --> 00:40:30.344
[Phillip] Oh.

00:40:30.428 --> 00:40:31.804
Hey, guys, what's, uh…

00:40:33.097 --> 00:40:34.223
What's going on?

00:40:34.807 --> 00:40:40.354
We know who you are… Philip.

00:40:41.105 --> 00:40:45.067
[stumbling] What are you talking about?
I'm The Boogieman.

00:40:45.151 --> 00:40:46.986
R-Really. I am.

00:40:47.069 --> 00:40:48.279
You're not one of us.

00:40:49.738 --> 00:40:52.283
No. No. I am, I…

00:40:52.366 --> 00:40:55.995
I-I wanna be. I want to understand,
that's why I had to get here.

00:40:56.078 --> 00:40:57.329
To see you all.

00:40:59.123 --> 00:41:00.332
To learn.

00:41:01.125 --> 00:41:04.336
Okay, then… let us teach you.

00:41:05.337 --> 00:41:06.630
The Good Doctor.

00:41:07.381 --> 00:41:12.720
She likes to kill her victims
by removing their organs, one by one.

00:41:12.803 --> 00:41:14.555
Nimrod is a hunter.

00:41:14.638 --> 00:41:19.602
He can skin, bone, joint,
and gut just about any animal in minutes.

00:41:22.229 --> 00:41:26.317
And as for me, well…

00:41:27.359 --> 00:41:29.028
I like the eyes.

00:41:32.865 --> 00:41:33.991
[screaming]

00:41:36.243 --> 00:41:37.077
[all grunting]

00:41:48.839 --> 00:41:50.633
[exclaiming]

00:41:50.716 --> 00:41:52.510
This one's mine.

00:41:56.555 --> 00:41:57.389
[Fun Land] Whoa.

00:41:57.473 --> 00:41:59.058
-Buddy.
-Sorry.

00:41:59.141 --> 00:42:00.309
Are you okay? What's wrong?

00:42:00.392 --> 00:42:01.352
They're after me.

00:42:01.435 --> 00:42:02.603
Who? Who's after you?

00:42:03.354 --> 00:42:04.271
Come on.

00:42:05.064 --> 00:42:06.774
You'll be safe in my room. Yeah?

00:42:11.237 --> 00:42:16.867
So, he too spent the last century
in the waking world.

00:42:16.951 --> 00:42:21.872
Yes, but he seems to have
experienced the worst of humankind.

00:42:21.956 --> 00:42:26.001
Still, his time there appears to have
changed him as it has changed me.

00:42:26.085 --> 00:42:28.045
-How so?
-[chuckles]

00:42:28.128 --> 00:42:32.091
Lucienne, he came to you
and told you he was wrong.

00:42:32.174 --> 00:42:33.842
It was very nearly an apology.

00:42:33.926 --> 00:42:36.679
The Morpheus I knew was incapable of that.

00:42:36.762 --> 00:42:38.055
[Lucienne] Hmm.

00:42:38.138 --> 00:42:42.685
Then perhaps he will be merciful to you
since you came back on your own.

00:42:42.768 --> 00:42:44.812
Oh, it doesn't matter what happens to me.

00:42:44.895 --> 00:42:48.607
What matters is that
Dream stops The Corinthian

00:42:49.316 --> 00:42:51.277
and saves Rose Walker.

00:42:52.278 --> 00:42:54.530
There is no saving Rose Walker.

00:42:56.031 --> 00:42:57.950
Why on earth would you say that?

00:42:58.701 --> 00:42:59.702
Do you not know?

00:43:02.162 --> 00:43:03.747
She's a vortex.

00:43:05.082 --> 00:43:05.958
Oh.

00:43:06.834 --> 00:43:07.960
Oh, dear.

00:43:08.627 --> 00:43:10.087
I should have realized.

00:43:10.921 --> 00:43:12.172
What have I done?

00:43:12.256 --> 00:43:15.551
He's… He's going to have to kill her.

00:43:28.606 --> 00:43:29.481
Hello?

00:43:37.323 --> 00:43:38.490
Hello?

00:43:41.327 --> 00:43:42.161
Jed?

00:43:43.871 --> 00:43:44.955
Rose?

00:43:49.543 --> 00:43:51.545
-Jed?
-Rose!

00:43:58.093 --> 00:44:00.554
You can't have him. He's my friend.

00:44:00.638 --> 00:44:01.847
-Stop.
-We were playing.

00:44:01.930 --> 00:44:04.016
-Let him go. He's my brother.
-He's mine!

00:44:04.099 --> 00:44:05.768
Let me go!

00:44:05.851 --> 00:44:06.977
[Fun Land grunts]

00:44:12.066 --> 00:44:13.484
[both panting]

00:44:16.695 --> 00:44:17.655
Hurry up!

00:44:21.158 --> 00:44:22.701
[laughing maniacally]

00:44:22.785 --> 00:44:23.702
Come on!

00:44:25.704 --> 00:44:28.791
[Jed] Help! Help!

00:44:30.417 --> 00:44:31.627
[panting] You hurt me.

00:44:32.920 --> 00:44:34.546
Now I'm gonna have to hurt you. [gasps]

00:44:37.299 --> 00:44:38.133
[body thuds]

00:44:39.176 --> 00:44:40.886
Hello, Rose.

00:44:44.807 --> 00:44:45.724
[grunts]

00:44:47.267 --> 00:44:48.102
Don't worry.

00:44:52.189 --> 00:44:53.399
