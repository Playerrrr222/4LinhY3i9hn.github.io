00:00:11.052 --> 00:00:13.054
[intense music playing]

00:00:28.361 --> 00:00:30.071
You are welcome here, Rose Walker.

00:00:32.032 --> 00:00:33.033
Who are you?

00:00:33.616 --> 00:00:37.579
You have somehow dreamed your way
into an audience with Lord Morpheus.

00:00:38.788 --> 00:00:40.290
The King of Dreams.

00:00:41.249 --> 00:00:42.834
-And now you must go.
-Lucienne.

00:00:42.917 --> 00:00:44.794
She shouldn't be here.

00:00:45.295 --> 00:00:48.965
No, but I should like her to stay.

00:00:52.052 --> 00:00:53.470
What is this place?

00:00:54.095 --> 00:00:55.430
[Dream] You're in The Dreaming,

00:00:56.097 --> 00:00:57.891
the place where
people come when they sleep.

00:01:00.143 --> 00:01:03.063
So, I'm asleep right now? I'm dreaming?

00:01:03.146 --> 00:01:07.484
[Dream] Yes, and I should like to know
how it is you found me.

00:01:08.151 --> 00:01:11.029
I heard you talking about my brother.
Is he here?

00:01:12.655 --> 00:01:13.531
No.

00:01:14.407 --> 00:01:15.992
[Rose] Do you know where he is?

00:01:16.868 --> 00:01:17.702
No.

00:01:21.331 --> 00:01:24.667
But I think he might be with
one of my missing Nightmares.

00:01:27.462 --> 00:01:29.422
She's a nightmare?

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:32.258
What would she want with Jed?

00:01:32.342 --> 00:01:33.301
I don't know.

00:01:34.844 --> 00:01:37.180
But I have a feeling
it has something to do with you.

00:01:37.764 --> 00:01:41.518
Me? Why? What did I do?

00:01:41.601 --> 00:01:45.271
It is not what you did.
It is what you are.

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:49.442
I'm sorry. I don't understand any of this.

00:01:49.526 --> 00:01:50.401
No.

00:01:50.985 --> 00:01:54.197
Dream vortexes
are largely incomprehensible.

00:01:54.989 --> 00:01:56.241
What's a dream vortex?

00:01:57.075 --> 00:01:58.409
You are.

00:01:58.493 --> 00:02:00.787
You see, once every few thousand years,

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:04.582
a mortal is born with
a dreaming ability so powerful,

00:02:05.083 --> 00:02:07.794
she can travel
through the dreams of others.

00:02:08.378 --> 00:02:10.255
Apparently, all the way to my throne room.

00:02:11.131 --> 00:02:12.882
I was just looking for my brother.

00:02:12.966 --> 00:02:17.137
If you can find me in The Dreaming,
you can find your brother.

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.264
No matter where Gault has hidden him.

00:02:20.557 --> 00:02:22.976
How? How do I do that?

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:27.522
For now, keep looking for your brother
in the waking world.

00:02:28.439 --> 00:02:30.150
Matthew will watch over you there.

00:02:30.233 --> 00:02:32.235
At your service, Rose.

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:36.656
When he is with you, I am with you.

00:02:37.365 --> 00:02:39.200
Then tonight, when you sleep,

00:02:39.284 --> 00:02:42.745
you and I will go in search
for Gault and your brother together.

00:02:44.164 --> 00:02:45.373
In your dreams.

00:02:47.584 --> 00:02:49.460
She's just a nightmare, right?

00:02:49.544 --> 00:02:52.380
She can't hurt him, can she?

00:03:02.932 --> 00:03:04.642
[alarm blaring]

00:03:11.274 --> 00:03:13.526
Which one of my enemies is it this time?

00:03:14.444 --> 00:03:15.945
Johnny Sorrow?

00:03:16.446 --> 00:03:17.947
The Phantom of the Fair?

00:03:18.448 --> 00:03:20.325
Or is Doctor Death back for more?

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:28.499
[Gault] It's the Pied Piper.

00:03:28.583 --> 00:03:32.670
He appears to be using
next-gen sonic technology

00:03:33.213 --> 00:03:35.798
to control all the area's children.

00:03:35.882 --> 00:03:37.467
[typing]

00:03:37.967 --> 00:03:39.802
This looks like a job for…

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:45.016
The Sandman.

00:03:48.061 --> 00:03:49.687
Time I put the Piper to bed.

00:03:55.193 --> 00:03:56.027
[wind blowing]

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:14.045
No sign of the Piper. No sign of anyone.

00:04:15.463 --> 00:04:18.883
[Gault] I'm afraid we're too late.
They've all been kidnapped.

00:04:23.554 --> 00:04:24.597
[Jed] Wait.

00:04:24.681 --> 00:04:26.307
[lively pipe music playing]

00:04:26.933 --> 00:04:28.059
Can you hear that?

00:04:28.142 --> 00:04:29.310
[Gault] The Pipers' tune.

00:04:30.228 --> 00:04:31.854
Can you hear where it's coming from?

00:04:34.524 --> 00:04:36.109
[chuckles] I can.

00:04:38.861 --> 00:04:39.988
[music gets louder]

00:04:42.865 --> 00:04:44.158
[rumbling]

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:47.328
[Jed] Are you seeing this?

00:04:50.581 --> 00:04:52.834
[Gault] I am,
and I don't like what I'm seeing.

00:04:52.917 --> 00:04:54.294
Return to base, Sandman.

00:04:55.628 --> 00:04:56.546
[Jed] Don't worry.

00:05:00.842 --> 00:05:01.718
I've got this.

00:05:08.182 --> 00:05:09.100
Rats!

00:05:10.393 --> 00:05:11.519
[exclaims softly]

00:05:12.437 --> 00:05:14.188
Get back here, Jed. Right now.

00:05:14.272 --> 00:05:16.190
There's too many of them! Ahh!

00:05:16.274 --> 00:05:17.900
[screaming]

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:21.070
-[grunts] Help!
-I'm trying, Jed, hold on.

00:05:21.154 --> 00:05:22.196
-No!
-Jed!

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:23.573
-Please help!
-Jed!

00:05:24.157 --> 00:05:25.992
-[Jed grunting]
-[squeaking loudly]

00:05:27.785 --> 00:05:29.704
[panting]

00:06:01.152 --> 00:06:02.612
Aunt Clarice?

00:06:04.489 --> 00:06:06.032
Uncle Barnaby?

00:06:07.992 --> 00:06:09.535
[knocks]

00:06:09.619 --> 00:06:11.287
I-I-I think I'm hurt.

00:06:11.913 --> 00:06:12.955
[knocks]

00:06:13.039 --> 00:06:14.332
Is anyone there?

00:06:16.793 --> 00:06:17.627
Don't.

00:06:21.547 --> 00:06:23.341
We can't just leave him down there.

00:06:23.424 --> 00:06:26.928
The second you open that door,
he's gonna run away again.

00:06:30.014 --> 00:06:31.099
He has to learn.

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:40.733
[Jed] Aunt Clarice?

00:06:42.693 --> 00:06:43.820
[knocking on door]

00:06:46.823 --> 00:06:47.990
Is anyone there?

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:03.297
[caws]

00:07:05.883 --> 00:07:07.135
[taps]

00:07:07.218 --> 00:07:08.052
[caws]

00:07:10.805 --> 00:07:11.639
Matthew?

00:07:15.059 --> 00:07:15.935
[sighs]

00:07:25.403 --> 00:07:27.738
Unity, hi. It's Rose calling.

00:07:27.822 --> 00:07:28.906
How are you, darling?

00:07:29.615 --> 00:07:32.577
How was it with the foster agent?
Was she awful?

00:07:33.161 --> 00:07:35.163
Well, she wouldn't tell us where Jed is.

00:07:35.246 --> 00:07:36.664
[Unity] Oh, no, of course not.

00:07:37.248 --> 00:07:38.958
That would have made it far too easy.

00:07:39.041 --> 00:07:40.543
[Rose] But she did tell us one thing.

00:07:40.626 --> 00:07:44.088
Apparently, Jed's foster parents
were friends of my dad's.

00:07:44.172 --> 00:07:46.340
So, she told you quite a bit.

00:07:47.008 --> 00:07:48.926
Do you remember your father's friends?

00:07:50.052 --> 00:07:52.763
No, but if it's okay with you,

00:07:52.847 --> 00:07:54.765
I thought I'd stay longer and maybe…

00:07:54.849 --> 00:07:57.268
Oh, of course, love. Of course, Rose.

00:07:57.351 --> 00:07:59.437
-[man] May I?
-Please.

00:08:00.104 --> 00:08:02.857
Unity, am I interrupting something?

00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:06.861
There is a lovely young journalist here

00:08:06.944 --> 00:08:09.572
who wants to interview me
about the sleepy sickness.

00:08:09.655 --> 00:08:10.823
Unity.

00:08:10.907 --> 00:08:15.077
I keep telling him,
I slept through the entire thing.

00:08:15.912 --> 00:08:18.789
I'm hanging up now. Enjoy being famous.

00:08:20.958 --> 00:08:23.544
That was my great-granddaughter, Rose.

00:08:23.628 --> 00:08:25.421
Oh. Is she in London?

00:08:25.505 --> 00:08:26.923
She was.

00:08:27.006 --> 00:08:30.426
Now she's back in the United States.
In Florida.

00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:33.346
Really? Whereabouts in Florida?

00:08:34.305 --> 00:08:36.349
A town called Cape Kennedy.

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:40.228
You sound American to me. Have you been?

00:08:40.895 --> 00:08:44.565
Cape Kennedy? No.
But now I'll have to visit.

00:08:58.162 --> 00:08:59.747
[Hal] Did you figure out the printer?

00:08:59.830 --> 00:09:00.706
I did.

00:09:02.083 --> 00:09:02.959
What do you think?

00:09:04.001 --> 00:09:04.835
Oh.

00:09:05.628 --> 00:09:07.713
I think I wanna help you
put these up all over town.

00:09:07.797 --> 00:09:09.090
-Really?
-[Hal] Mm-hmm.

00:09:09.173 --> 00:09:10.841
-Can I pay you for them?
-You already did.

00:09:10.925 --> 00:09:12.176
I overcharged you for the room.

00:09:13.094 --> 00:09:13.928
May I see?

00:09:15.429 --> 00:09:16.430
[Barbie] Morning!

00:09:16.514 --> 00:09:18.975
[gasps] Oh, my gosh. Rose!

00:09:19.559 --> 00:09:21.686
Oh, look at you guys. Can I have some?

00:09:21.769 --> 00:09:23.563
Uh, babe. What are you doin'?

00:09:23.646 --> 00:09:24.522
Putting these up.

00:09:24.605 --> 00:09:26.399
Yeah, but we're out all day with Sindy.

00:09:26.482 --> 00:09:29.652
Sindy can put some up too.
She's our realtor. She's fabulous.

00:09:30.736 --> 00:09:31.779
[Rose] Thank you, guys.

00:09:34.156 --> 00:09:36.033
Zelda suggests we take some as well.

00:09:36.117 --> 00:09:37.243
Thank you.

00:09:37.326 --> 00:09:39.287
We can all hit the streets
when Lyta wakes up.

00:09:39.370 --> 00:09:40.538
She's still asleep?

00:09:49.714 --> 00:09:51.549
I just wanna stay like this forever.

00:09:53.301 --> 00:09:54.302
[Hector sighs]

00:09:55.011 --> 00:09:56.429
I do too, but…

00:09:57.346 --> 00:09:58.180
What?

00:09:58.931 --> 00:10:01.934
You should be out,
living your actual life,

00:10:02.018 --> 00:10:05.438
not having ghost-sex
with your dead husband.

00:10:05.938 --> 00:10:08.774
You're not a ghost, you're a dream.

00:10:10.985 --> 00:10:11.819
Yeah.

00:10:12.903 --> 00:10:15.114
Been meaning to talk to you about that.

00:10:16.866 --> 00:10:18.409
If I were a dream,

00:10:19.452 --> 00:10:22.079
wouldn't I disappear when you wake up?

00:10:23.706 --> 00:10:24.790
-Don't you?
-No.

00:10:26.208 --> 00:10:27.418
Then what do you do?

00:10:27.501 --> 00:10:30.421
I go to work. I… I cook. I work out--

00:10:30.504 --> 00:10:31.756
You go to work?

00:10:31.839 --> 00:10:33.090
[chuckles]

00:10:33.841 --> 00:10:34.675
Yeah.

00:10:34.759 --> 00:10:35.968
Doing what?

00:10:42.391 --> 00:10:44.518
I finally built our house.

00:10:45.353 --> 00:10:46.270
Can I show you?

00:10:56.072 --> 00:10:57.073
[sighs]

00:11:05.665 --> 00:11:08.084
You… You built our house?

00:11:10.294 --> 00:11:12.630
Come on. I'll give you the tour.

00:11:32.692 --> 00:11:34.819
I did my best to follow your blueprints,

00:11:34.902 --> 00:11:38.197
but there were a few details
I, I just couldn't remember.

00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:39.407
[softly] It's perfect.

00:11:45.788 --> 00:11:46.956
What's in there?

00:11:47.039 --> 00:11:49.875
Uh, that room's not quite finished yet.

00:12:07.309 --> 00:12:08.686
Why did you build this?

00:12:12.106 --> 00:12:13.441
Because it was our dream.

00:12:17.361 --> 00:12:20.698
And now that we're both here,
maybe it can come true.

00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:22.074
How?

00:12:23.492 --> 00:12:24.785
You have to stay with me.

00:12:26.328 --> 00:12:27.204
Here.

00:12:28.164 --> 00:12:29.832
In our house, the way we planned.

00:12:31.167 --> 00:12:32.042
[sighs]

00:12:33.043 --> 00:12:33.878
Sweetie.

00:12:38.549 --> 00:12:41.051
You know eventually I have to wake up.

00:12:52.188 --> 00:12:53.272
[sighs]

00:13:03.449 --> 00:13:04.325
You're awake.

00:13:05.201 --> 00:13:06.035
Yeah.

00:13:07.495 --> 00:13:08.996
-You okay?
-Yeah.

00:13:10.748 --> 00:13:11.791
What are those?

00:13:14.001 --> 00:13:15.294
Is this a terrible idea?

00:13:19.340 --> 00:13:21.008
No, not at all.

00:13:21.592 --> 00:13:25.429
'Cause I was thinking, we could put up
a few near the foster agency?

00:13:25.513 --> 00:13:27.598
Just to let that woman know
we're not giving up.

00:13:27.681 --> 00:13:29.767
No, I think she probably got that
from yesterday.

00:13:29.850 --> 00:13:31.268
Was I that bad?

00:13:31.894 --> 00:13:33.979
-Should I go there and apologize?
-No.

00:13:35.022 --> 00:13:37.608
But why don't you let me
do that side of town?

00:13:41.904 --> 00:13:44.657
My lord, may I help?

00:13:44.740 --> 00:13:46.867
[Dream] Is this everything
we have on Rose Walker?

00:13:46.951 --> 00:13:47.952
And Jed Walker.

00:13:48.035 --> 00:13:51.330
But I shouldn't think there's anything
in those you don't already know.

00:13:51.413 --> 00:13:52.248
Except perhaps--

00:13:52.331 --> 00:13:54.959
Except perhaps why she was able
to wander into my throne room.

00:13:55.042 --> 00:13:56.544
What do you think?

00:13:56.627 --> 00:13:59.338
Why did Gault target her brother
and not her?

00:14:00.297 --> 00:14:02.091
Did you read about Unity Kincaid?

00:14:03.175 --> 00:14:04.677
The day you were imprisoned,

00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:08.931
there were people all over the world
who fell asleep and could not wake up.

00:14:09.765 --> 00:14:14.812
Unity Kincaid is the sole survivor
of what they called the "sleepy sickness."

00:14:15.729 --> 00:14:18.816
The day you returned, she woke up.

00:14:19.525 --> 00:14:22.111
Rose Walker is her great-granddaughter.

00:14:24.572 --> 00:14:28.617
Which would seem to suggest that
my absence caused the birth of a vortex.

00:14:29.201 --> 00:14:30.619
Is that not a possibility?

00:14:30.703 --> 00:14:33.163
Vortexes are
naturally occurring phenomena.

00:14:33.247 --> 00:14:35.207
No one knows why they happen.
Not even I know.

00:14:35.291 --> 00:14:37.293
But I do know
they are not caused or created.

00:14:37.376 --> 00:14:39.461
They simply happen.

00:14:40.379 --> 00:14:44.216
Then this is all a coincidence?
And not an imminent threat?

00:14:44.300 --> 00:14:48.137
My instinct says no, but tonight
when Rose Walker sleeps,

00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:50.681
I shall see it more clearly. May I?

00:14:52.182 --> 00:14:53.017
Of course.

00:14:54.518 --> 00:14:56.979
[Rose] I've been trying to
remember my dad's friends,

00:14:57.062 --> 00:14:59.565
but I don't think he had any.

00:15:01.191 --> 00:15:02.776
He was a pretty unfriendly guy.

00:15:02.860 --> 00:15:07.031
Well, do you remember any golf buddies,
or drinking buddies, or…

00:15:07.114 --> 00:15:10.492
What else do
married straight men with kids do?

00:15:10.576 --> 00:15:13.746
Well, if they're anything like my dad,
they have affairs.

00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:15.539
Oh.

00:15:15.623 --> 00:15:17.499
That's why your mom divorced him.

00:15:18.042 --> 00:15:19.293
That was just one reason.

00:15:20.127 --> 00:15:21.962
Maybe your dad didn't have friends.

00:15:22.046 --> 00:15:24.298
That's why I thought
we'd start with his neighbors.

00:15:25.132 --> 00:15:28.135
That was his house. Our house.

00:15:29.470 --> 00:15:34.600
The last time I saw Jed was right there,
seven years ago.

00:15:35.893 --> 00:15:37.269
You haven't seen him since?

00:15:39.104 --> 00:15:43.817
When my mom got a job in New Jersey,
my dad cut us off completely.

00:15:44.860 --> 00:15:47.821
Stopped paying alimony, child support.

00:15:48.864 --> 00:15:51.241
He wouldn't let us see
or even talk to Jed.

00:15:51.325 --> 00:15:52.368
[Hal] Hmm.

00:15:56.455 --> 00:15:57.539
[doorbell rings]

00:15:59.792 --> 00:16:00.918
My mom sued.

00:16:01.001 --> 00:16:05.381
She never gave up,
but I went off to college.

00:16:08.550 --> 00:16:10.260
I haven't been a very good sister.

00:16:10.761 --> 00:16:12.972
Mm, you're making up for it now, though.

00:16:13.806 --> 00:16:14.765
I'm trying.

00:16:15.724 --> 00:16:16.976
[knocking at door]

00:16:17.810 --> 00:16:18.769
Come in.

00:16:19.853 --> 00:16:20.938
Hi, Ms. Rubio.

00:16:22.398 --> 00:16:24.942
I'm Lyta Hall. Rose Walker's friend.

00:16:25.818 --> 00:16:27.778
What can I do for you, Ms. Hall?

00:16:30.990 --> 00:16:33.617
I just wanted to come by
and apologize for yesterday.

00:16:34.910 --> 00:16:36.620
I know your job is hard enough

00:16:36.704 --> 00:16:40.791
without having to deal with
other people's, uh, grief.

00:16:41.667 --> 00:16:44.086
'Cause that's what it was. It wasn't you.

00:16:45.462 --> 00:16:46.880
Rose wanted to come by but--

00:16:46.964 --> 00:16:50.259
But she is out looking for her brother.

00:16:55.764 --> 00:16:58.475
I think she really just
wants to know if he's okay.

00:16:58.559 --> 00:17:00.227
I'm sure he is.

00:17:02.062 --> 00:17:06.358
Is there any way you could find out?
Check up on him?

00:17:06.442 --> 00:17:07.651
You wouldn't have to tell us.

00:17:07.735 --> 00:17:13.073
I don't wanna get you in trouble,
but do you do follow-up visits?

00:17:13.157 --> 00:17:15.868
We do. But I can't just--

00:17:15.951 --> 00:17:17.911
No, I understand.

00:17:19.288 --> 00:17:20.289
I'm sorry.

00:17:20.873 --> 00:17:23.000
That's really all I came here to say.

00:17:25.544 --> 00:17:28.005
Thank you, Ms. Rubio, for your time.

00:17:36.722 --> 00:17:37.723
[door closes]

00:17:54.698 --> 00:17:57.451
The woman from the foster agency
wants to come by.

00:17:58.410 --> 00:17:59.286
For what?

00:18:00.370 --> 00:18:02.456
-To check on Jed.
-What?

00:18:03.248 --> 00:18:04.625
Why now, all of a sudden?

00:18:06.001 --> 00:18:09.630
It's a… They do that.
It's a regular thing.

00:18:10.798 --> 00:18:11.924
What did you tell her?

00:18:13.592 --> 00:18:16.512
Well, I couldn't tell her no.

00:18:16.595 --> 00:18:17.513
I can.

00:18:18.055 --> 00:18:19.348
Call her back.

00:18:22.476 --> 00:18:24.103
Fine, I'll do it.

00:18:25.729 --> 00:18:28.482
You don't think
that's gonna raise a red flag?

00:18:33.237 --> 00:18:37.199
If you don't want him here,
we can give him back.

00:18:38.951 --> 00:18:41.662
I'm not giving back $800 a month.

00:18:44.373 --> 00:18:45.374
Get him up here.

00:18:45.958 --> 00:18:48.585
I'll talk to him.
I'll make sure he doesn't run away again.

00:18:48.669 --> 00:18:51.547
No. I'll talk to him.

00:18:59.596 --> 00:19:00.931
[Clarice] Come on up, Jed.

00:19:04.226 --> 00:19:05.644
-You're all right.
-[sighs]

00:19:17.614 --> 00:19:20.617
The woman from the foster agency's
coming to check up on you.

00:19:22.161 --> 00:19:25.497
If you're good,
you can sleep in your own bed tonight.

00:19:28.167 --> 00:19:30.627
But if you embarrass us
in front of this woman,

00:19:31.378 --> 00:19:33.255
I will take you back into the cellar.

00:19:34.298 --> 00:19:36.967
I will wire your hands to
the pipes down there,

00:19:38.510 --> 00:19:40.846
and I will break every bone in your body.

00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:45.058
Do you understand me, Jed?

00:19:47.436 --> 00:19:48.770
Then go clean yourself up.

00:19:53.942 --> 00:19:57.279
Here. I'll fix you something to eat.

00:20:01.909 --> 00:20:02.868
[fridge door opens]

00:20:16.173 --> 00:20:18.008
[indistinct chatter]

00:20:18.091 --> 00:20:19.968
I mean, I tried to escape.

00:20:20.052 --> 00:20:25.682
I went directly to New York after college
to have a huge Broadway career,

00:20:26.433 --> 00:20:29.394
before moving on to film
and television, of course.

00:20:29.478 --> 00:20:30.395
Of course.

00:20:30.938 --> 00:20:32.940
But, you know, these days,

00:20:33.023 --> 00:20:35.525
if you're not already
a film or television star,

00:20:35.609 --> 00:20:37.611
you can't even get a job on Broadway.

00:20:37.694 --> 00:20:39.446
So, when my grandmother died

00:20:39.529 --> 00:20:43.742
and left me that ridiculous house,
I came home.

00:20:44.451 --> 00:20:45.869
[Rose] Do you miss New York?

00:20:46.578 --> 00:20:49.289
-[Hal] Not as much as I thought I would.
-Hmm.

00:20:49.373 --> 00:20:52.960
I mean, New York's very hard,
and this place is not so bad.

00:20:59.258 --> 00:21:02.135
I'm gonna put a few up over there.

00:21:02.219 --> 00:21:03.929
So if you maybe want to…

00:21:04.012 --> 00:21:05.973
Yeah, absolutely. I'll catch up with you.

00:21:19.278 --> 00:21:21.738
Matthew, is that you?

00:21:24.783 --> 00:21:26.326
[Matthew] No, that's a crow.

00:21:28.912 --> 00:21:31.957
I'm a raven. Common mistake.

00:21:34.334 --> 00:21:35.335
You're real?

00:21:36.253 --> 00:21:39.089
Technically I'm a dream, but sure.

00:21:40.716 --> 00:21:43.176
[Rose] And is Morpheus watching right now?

00:21:43.260 --> 00:21:45.595
[Matthew] He is. I can feel him
in the back of my head.

00:21:45.679 --> 00:21:46.847
It's the weirdest feeling.

00:21:46.930 --> 00:21:47.764
[Corinthian] Fuck.

00:21:47.848 --> 00:21:49.182
[Matthew] Do you need him?

00:21:49.808 --> 00:21:53.770
[Rose] No, but he said
he'd be there tonight when I fall asleep.

00:21:53.854 --> 00:21:55.647
He's gonna help me find my brother.

00:21:55.731 --> 00:21:56.898
That's the plan.

00:21:56.982 --> 00:21:58.900
And I'll be around till then
if you need me.

00:21:59.443 --> 00:22:00.319
Thank you.

00:22:01.069 --> 00:22:01.987
You got it, kid.

00:22:07.242 --> 00:22:11.038
[Hal] …Jed Walker. If you see him
or know anything about him, just text.

00:22:11.121 --> 00:22:12.581
[man speaks indistinctly]

00:22:12.664 --> 00:22:14.124
Okay. Thanks.

00:22:14.750 --> 00:22:16.293
What have you got there?

00:22:17.919 --> 00:22:18.879
Hi.

00:22:18.962 --> 00:22:22.257
Uh, we're looking
for a kid named Jed Walker.

00:22:22.341 --> 00:22:23.925
He would be about 12 now.

00:22:24.051 --> 00:22:25.886
Oh. How long has he been missing?

00:22:25.969 --> 00:22:28.221
Well, he's not actually missing.
He's in foster care.

00:22:28.305 --> 00:22:31.016
But the agency won't tell us where.

00:22:31.516 --> 00:22:33.935
-Would you mind if I kept this?
-No, not at all.

00:22:34.019 --> 00:22:35.896
Mm. See you around.

00:22:35.979 --> 00:22:37.606
[Hal] Yeah, I hope so.

00:22:41.151 --> 00:22:42.319
[Rose] Friend of yours?

00:22:43.111 --> 00:22:47.074
No, but he took a flier,
so he might be calling.

00:22:47.157 --> 00:22:49.326
Mm-hmm. I'll give him your number.

00:22:49.409 --> 00:22:52.746
You're a good friend, Rose Walker.

00:22:55.665 --> 00:22:57.626
He's doing great in school.

00:22:59.753 --> 00:23:01.213
Helps out around the house.

00:23:02.047 --> 00:23:03.340
Never complains.

00:23:04.174 --> 00:23:05.842
I don't know what we'd do without him.

00:23:06.426 --> 00:23:07.469
Right, Barn?

00:23:09.221 --> 00:23:10.347
That's right.

00:23:10.430 --> 00:23:11.932
[Eleanor] I'm so happy to hear that.

00:23:12.808 --> 00:23:14.309
You look good, Jed.

00:23:14.393 --> 00:23:15.727
You look happy.

00:23:16.311 --> 00:23:17.270
Thank you, ma'am.

00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:23.193
I wonder if I might have
a moment alone with you both.

00:23:24.194 --> 00:23:26.029
It's just some admin updates.

00:23:28.990 --> 00:23:30.575
You wanna go to your room, son?

00:23:42.629 --> 00:23:44.589
[Eleanor] It's all pretty straightforward.

00:23:44.673 --> 00:23:48.135
I just need to update Jed's file
with all his current information.

00:23:48.218 --> 00:23:51.221
His school, insurance.
All the usual stuff.

00:23:53.014 --> 00:23:55.350
Is he still in Callow Elementary?

00:23:55.851 --> 00:23:57.394
So good to see you, Ms. Rubio.

00:24:01.064 --> 00:24:01.898
[Eleanor] Oh.

00:24:04.943 --> 00:24:06.528
It's good to see you too, Jed.

00:24:24.379 --> 00:24:26.590
[door opens and closes]

00:24:28.592 --> 00:24:31.386
Hello. How can I help you?

00:24:31.470 --> 00:24:32.846
I have a question for you.

00:24:35.557 --> 00:24:37.142
Have you seen this boy?

00:24:41.062 --> 00:24:44.774
Your Aunt Clarice and I
want you to know we were very impressed.

00:24:46.776 --> 00:24:51.364
With the way you got this note
into that lady's bag.

00:24:54.576 --> 00:24:55.494
I'm sorry.

00:24:56.077 --> 00:24:57.329
[Barnaby] No, you're not.

00:25:03.001 --> 00:25:04.044
But you will be.

00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:31.363
[Corinthian] Hmm.

00:25:31.446 --> 00:25:32.864
[chomping]

00:25:39.955 --> 00:25:41.206
[Rose] Where is everyone?

00:25:41.289 --> 00:25:43.291
[Hal] They must have all gone to bed.

00:25:43.375 --> 00:25:46.878
There's not much to do
in Cape Kennedy after dark.

00:25:48.129 --> 00:25:49.923
Or during the day for that matter.

00:25:50.465 --> 00:25:52.300
That's kinda what I like about it.

00:25:53.343 --> 00:25:56.221
I was thinking, maybe I should move back.

00:25:57.389 --> 00:25:59.766
Why? To do what?

00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:01.434
I don't know.

00:26:02.018 --> 00:26:04.854
Before my mom died,
I was gonna go to grad school

00:26:05.647 --> 00:26:07.899
[chuckles] and try to become a writer.

00:26:08.817 --> 00:26:10.402
But maybe it's like you and New York.

00:26:10.485 --> 00:26:13.238
[scoffs] God. I hope not.

00:26:13.321 --> 00:26:15.657
No, I mean, your life is here.

00:26:15.740 --> 00:26:16.908
You have this house.

00:26:17.534 --> 00:26:19.911
People who love you. You've got Dolly.

00:26:19.995 --> 00:26:22.998
Rose, do you think I wanna be here?

00:26:25.083 --> 00:26:27.502
Cleaning up after Barbie and Ken?

00:26:28.461 --> 00:26:30.797
Don't get me wrong,
I love them, they're great.

00:26:31.590 --> 00:26:35.927
But if Broadway called tomorrow,
I would sell this fucking house.

00:26:37.387 --> 00:26:40.223
And I would never think about
any of these people ever again.

00:26:43.476 --> 00:26:44.728
Go to grad school,

00:26:45.604 --> 00:26:48.857
write a novel… about me,

00:26:49.357 --> 00:26:53.778
but do it now while I'm still cute enough
to play myself in the movie.

00:26:55.113 --> 00:26:57.616
'Cause this was never my dream.

00:43:34.528 --> 00:43:35.863
We all change, sir.

00:43:37.364 --> 00:43:40.367
Even you, perhaps. One day.

00:43:43.162 --> 00:43:45.122
Lucienne, I realize that in my absence,

00:43:45.205 --> 00:43:47.291
you were compelled to
make decisions in my stead,

00:43:47.374 --> 00:43:51.003
and I am grateful to you.

00:43:52.171 --> 00:43:53.964
But I am back now.

00:43:58.135 --> 00:43:59.803
You may return to the library.

00:45:03.283 --> 00:45:04.993
Your sister sent me.

00:45:06.412 --> 00:45:07.871
Your sister, Rose.

00:45:29.393 --> 00:45:30.477
Ma'am, you can't be here.

00:45:30.561 --> 00:45:32.479
My little brother, Jed,
he lives with them.

00:45:32.563 --> 00:45:34.940
Is he inside? Is he okay?

00:45:35.524 --> 00:45:37.234
There was no one else inside.

00:45:37.317 --> 00:45:39.111
Just the two adult victims.

00:45:39.194 --> 00:45:41.321
Wherever your brother is, he's not here.

00:45:53.375 --> 00:45:55.419
So, how do you know my sister?

00:45:57.087 --> 00:45:57.963
I don't.

00:46:03.343 --> 00:46:05.304
