00:00:11.052 --> 00:00:13.054
[pleasant music playing]

00:00:38.747 --> 00:00:40.040
[boy] Don't forget these.

00:00:45.628 --> 00:00:46.588
Thanks, buddy.

00:00:49.007 --> 00:00:53.511
-You want to put your shoes on for me?
-How far is New Jersey from Florida?

00:00:54.471 --> 00:00:56.556
About two days in the car, but…

00:00:57.474 --> 00:01:00.143
-[woman] Are you gonna suddenly become--
-[man] He's my son!

00:01:01.102 --> 00:01:02.520
He doesn't want us to go.

00:01:04.814 --> 00:01:06.107
I know.

00:01:08.777 --> 00:01:09.903
You okay?

00:01:10.862 --> 00:01:11.738
Yeah.

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:14.741
But, um…

00:01:16.534 --> 00:01:20.497
Your dad and I were talking, and, um,

00:01:21.581 --> 00:01:26.628
we think maybe it's better
if Rose and I get settled first,

00:01:26.711 --> 00:01:28.963
and then bring you out to New Brunswick.

00:01:30.173 --> 00:01:31.007
What?

00:01:33.218 --> 00:01:34.260
We can't leave him.

00:01:34.344 --> 00:01:36.763
I'm not going with you?

00:01:36.846 --> 00:01:38.640
Not this trip, sweetie.

00:01:38.723 --> 00:01:40.100
Dad promised.

00:01:41.059 --> 00:01:42.310
He changed his mind.

00:01:44.896 --> 00:01:46.606
He said he'd miss you too much.

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:48.316
I'm gonna go talk to him.

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:49.359
Rose.

00:01:51.736 --> 00:01:53.571
He's not in a listening mood.

00:01:53.655 --> 00:01:56.157
He's just doing this out of spite.

00:01:56.241 --> 00:01:57.909
What happened to shared custody?

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:01.538
I can't take Jed
without your dad's permission.

00:02:03.665 --> 00:02:07.710
Say goodbye to your brother
and wait for me in the car, okay?

00:02:14.551 --> 00:02:15.718
[crying]

00:02:16.719 --> 00:02:17.804
I love you, Jeddy.

00:02:17.887 --> 00:02:19.764
Take me with you.

00:02:24.352 --> 00:02:25.937
Okay, let's get you unpacked, baby.

00:02:28.106 --> 00:02:29.899
[Jed] Rose, please.

00:02:29.983 --> 00:02:31.151
I'm sorry.

00:02:34.821 --> 00:02:37.991
-Rose! Rose!
-[woman] Jed, it's okay. It's okay, baby.

00:02:41.452 --> 00:02:42.453
[sniffles]

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:45.331
[Desire] Are you there, my sister?

00:02:45.415 --> 00:02:46.624
[heart beating]

00:02:52.338 --> 00:02:55.133
Will you talk to me, Queen of Despair?

00:02:56.843 --> 00:02:59.429
[Despair] I'm always ready
to listen to you, Desire.

00:03:01.306 --> 00:03:02.599
I have news.

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:06.352
Real news?

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:10.064
The Prodigal has returned?

00:03:10.148 --> 00:03:11.357
[Desire chuckling] What?

00:03:12.567 --> 00:03:14.861
Oh. Him? [scoffs]

00:03:14.944 --> 00:03:16.613
No, no, he's still missing.

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:20.033
I speak of Dream.

00:03:22.785 --> 00:03:24.412
He's managed to free himself.

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:29.292
You seek to snare him
in your machinations again?

00:03:31.836 --> 00:03:34.672
Has he not suffered enough
these last 100 years?

00:03:34.756 --> 00:03:36.090
Well, you would think so.

00:03:36.174 --> 00:03:40.261
But he's just as smug
and self-important as ever.

00:03:42.305 --> 00:03:45.225
Do you think these little games of ours
will change him?

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:49.020
This is no game, my twin.

00:03:49.646 --> 00:03:54.317
Dream still behaves
as if his realm is superior to ours.

00:03:55.485 --> 00:04:00.949
It's time that he learned that dreams
are merely echoes of desire and despair.

00:04:03.117 --> 00:04:07.413
Whatever this new scheme is,
it won't work.

00:04:08.164 --> 00:04:10.583
It didn't last time
or the time before that.

00:04:11.417 --> 00:04:12.710
Nada was a mistake.

00:04:13.628 --> 00:04:15.713
And Roderick Burgess was a diversion.

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:22.345
But things have changed, my love, my twin.

00:04:25.181 --> 00:04:27.308
There is a dream vortex.

00:04:27.392 --> 00:04:33.439
The first for a long time
and… it is a woman.

00:04:40.446 --> 00:04:42.991
-So we wait?
-We won't have to wait.

00:04:44.242 --> 00:04:46.494
The girl has no idea what she is,

00:04:46.577 --> 00:04:50.498
but she is already doing what vortexes do.

00:04:51.833 --> 00:04:55.378
Bringing in everything
and everyone to her.

00:04:56.296 --> 00:04:57.797
Including Morpheus.

00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:58.965
[Despair] Who is she?

00:04:59.674 --> 00:05:01.926
The woman who will be Dream's undoing?

00:05:03.886 --> 00:05:05.638
Her name is Rose.

00:05:07.932 --> 00:05:09.309
Rose Walker.

00:05:09.392 --> 00:05:11.019
-[woman 1] Rose?
-[knock on door]

00:05:11.769 --> 00:05:14.522
-Lyta. I found a new photo of Jed.
-What?

00:05:14.605 --> 00:05:17.108
-Well, not new. New to me.
-[woman 2 on phone] Hello?

00:05:17.984 --> 00:05:21.612
Miss Bloom? Hi, it's Rose Walker.
Miranda's daughter?

00:05:21.696 --> 00:05:22.905
The car's on its way.

00:05:22.989 --> 00:05:25.616
Sorry to bother you,
but I was going through my mom's stuff--

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:27.618
Carl, what are you doing here?

00:05:27.702 --> 00:05:29.662
I asked if I could
house-sit while you're gone.

00:05:29.746 --> 00:05:32.832
I found a photo of my brother Jed
that I've never seen before.

00:05:33.583 --> 00:05:35.418
-Uh…
-She'll need shoes with that.

00:05:35.501 --> 00:05:38.379
From before the divorce,
so it's at least seven years old,

00:05:38.463 --> 00:05:41.090
but you can see his face
really clearly in it.

00:05:41.174 --> 00:05:42.633
Can I send it to you?

00:05:44.218 --> 00:05:47.722
When… the foster agent
wouldn't tell us where she placed Jed,

00:05:47.805 --> 00:05:50.141
you said we could hire
a private investigator.

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:54.687
Well, I assumed my mom's estate
would cover the cost.

00:05:57.398 --> 00:05:58.232
Oh.

00:06:01.319 --> 00:06:04.489
No, I fully intend to pay your bill. Um…

00:06:04.572 --> 00:06:06.366
Just the minute I find a job.

00:06:07.283 --> 00:06:09.369
You're not hiring by any chance, are you?

00:06:11.079 --> 00:06:11.913
No?

00:06:13.498 --> 00:06:15.500
Okay. Thank you for your time.

00:06:21.714 --> 00:06:22.840
There's no money left?

00:06:24.175 --> 00:06:26.928
She said Mom spent it all
on the apartment.

00:06:27.011 --> 00:06:28.971
She wanted you to have a home.

00:06:30.223 --> 00:06:32.600
She wanted Jed to have a home too.

00:06:33.101 --> 00:06:34.102
[car horn honks]

00:06:35.645 --> 00:06:36.938
We have to go.

00:06:37.021 --> 00:06:39.649
-I don't think I can.
-Rosie.

00:06:39.732 --> 00:06:42.318
How can I leave the country
when I have no money, no job--

00:06:42.402 --> 00:06:46.531
Listen to me. If people are paying you
to be somewhere, that is a job.

00:06:46.614 --> 00:06:48.866
And this foundation
is paying you to fly to London.

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:50.076
They're not paying me.

00:06:50.159 --> 00:06:52.912
Your per diem is £250 a day.

00:06:52.995 --> 00:06:54.872
In cash. For seven days.

00:06:54.956 --> 00:06:57.917
In exchange
for one family history interview.

00:06:59.419 --> 00:07:01.170
[indistinct chatter]

00:07:01.754 --> 00:07:03.089
-Business class?
-[Lyta] Yeah.

00:07:03.172 --> 00:07:05.341
This foundation really wants to meet you.

00:07:05.425 --> 00:07:07.093
It's not me they want to meet.

00:07:07.844 --> 00:07:09.220
It was my mom.

00:07:11.514 --> 00:07:13.516
She was so looking forward to this.

00:07:15.685 --> 00:07:18.146
I'm a poor substitute, I know.

00:07:18.229 --> 00:07:20.106
No. Thank you for coming with me.

00:07:20.189 --> 00:07:23.109
I had no choice. Your mom insisted.

00:07:25.194 --> 00:07:26.571
And I'm very glad she did.

00:07:29.991 --> 00:07:32.118
It does get easier, right?

00:07:33.077 --> 00:07:37.373
You don't still think about Hector
every second of every day, do you?

00:07:40.751 --> 00:07:41.794
[stewardess] Champagne?

00:07:42.545 --> 00:07:43.588
Thank you.

00:07:44.755 --> 00:07:46.048
-Thank you.
-Here.

00:07:47.008 --> 00:07:49.760
Because, as my husband
and your mom would tell us,

00:07:49.844 --> 00:07:52.722
life is too short
not to enjoy business class.

00:07:56.893 --> 00:07:58.478
[Abel] Have you heard about the vortex?

00:07:59.604 --> 00:08:01.647
-Everyone's talking about it.
-[Lucienne] Everyone?

00:08:01.731 --> 00:08:04.108
Who's everyone, exactly?

00:08:04.192 --> 00:08:06.527
Well, Cain mostly, but--

00:08:06.611 --> 00:08:11.908
Abel, if I wanted to hear silly
hedge-gossip about… swirling entities,

00:08:11.991 --> 00:08:13.576
I would've asked you for it.

00:08:13.659 --> 00:08:17.580
But I'm here conducting a census
for Lord Morpheus now that he's back.

00:08:17.663 --> 00:08:22.335
Now, I'll need a complete list
of all entities residing here.

00:08:22.418 --> 00:08:24.337
Okay. Let me have a think. Um…

00:08:25.588 --> 00:08:27.006
-There's me.
-[Lucienne] Hmm.

00:08:27.089 --> 00:08:29.467
And the House of Secrets itself obviously.

00:08:29.550 --> 00:08:30.843
And the Bottle Imp.

00:08:30.927 --> 00:08:34.972
And, um… something unspeakably nasty
in the basement.

00:08:35.056 --> 00:08:37.350
Something nasty in the basement.

00:08:37.433 --> 00:08:39.852
I try not to go down there. And…

00:08:39.936 --> 00:08:41.270
-[Goldie chirps]
-[chuckles]

00:08:41.354 --> 00:08:43.814
I seem to have
inadvertently omitted my friend.

00:08:43.898 --> 00:08:45.358
It's called Goldie.

00:08:45.441 --> 00:08:49.237
One new addition.
A baby gargoyle called Goldie.

00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:52.448
So, does Lord Morpheus know about the…

00:08:52.532 --> 00:08:53.741
[chatters]

00:08:54.242 --> 00:08:55.326
[whispers] …vortex?

00:08:55.409 --> 00:08:56.661
I can assure you,

00:08:56.744 --> 00:09:01.499
Lord Morpheus has better things to do
than listen to foolish rumors.

00:09:06.045 --> 00:09:08.798
[man] Maybe a trip to England
is exactly what she needs.

00:09:09.465 --> 00:09:12.343
She's sleeping. So, that's progress.

00:09:13.010 --> 00:09:15.471
-She hasn't been sleeping?
-No.

00:09:16.764 --> 00:09:20.810
She's been dealing with her mom's estate,
trying to find her brother.

00:09:20.893 --> 00:09:22.186
Doing whatever she has to do

00:09:22.270 --> 00:09:25.648
to keep from thinking about the fact
that she's all alone now.

00:09:27.316 --> 00:09:28.651
She's not though.

00:09:29.694 --> 00:09:32.488
No, I know.
And friends are great, but, uh…

00:09:35.283 --> 00:09:36.117
What?

00:09:40.538 --> 00:09:43.249
When you lose your parents,
you suddenly realize

00:09:44.542 --> 00:09:47.461
it wasn't gravity
keeping you on the ground all this time.

00:09:48.588 --> 00:09:51.841
It was knowing you were
someone's daughter. Or sister.

00:09:52.717 --> 00:09:55.886
Or wife, in my case.

00:09:57.263 --> 00:10:01.183
I'm sorry. How are you? Are you okay?

00:10:02.852 --> 00:10:04.645
Probably not, no.

00:10:05.479 --> 00:10:06.522
Why do you say that?

00:10:08.441 --> 00:10:11.569
'Cause instead of being back at work,
I'm on a plane to London,

00:10:12.486 --> 00:10:13.988
talking to my dead husband.

00:10:17.366 --> 00:10:20.536
Ma'am? Ma'am?

00:10:25.833 --> 00:10:28.919
Sorry to wake you.
Would you mind fastening your seat belt?

00:10:29.837 --> 00:10:30.713
Thank you.

00:10:30.796 --> 00:10:31.797
[seatbelt clicks]

00:10:53.694 --> 00:10:56.697
I have completed the census
you requested, Lord Morpheus.

00:10:56.781 --> 00:10:59.075
Good. And?

00:10:59.158 --> 00:11:03.287
I have accounted for 11,062 of them.

00:11:03.371 --> 00:11:05.456
Wow. Someone's been busy.

00:11:05.539 --> 00:11:06.624
Yes. Well…

00:11:07.541 --> 00:11:09.377
There are a handful of new entities.

00:11:09.460 --> 00:11:11.212
That is to be expected.

00:11:11.295 --> 00:11:14.882
But… three of the Major Arcana are gone.

00:11:17.551 --> 00:11:18.469
Name them.

00:11:19.804 --> 00:11:21.389
The first is Gault.

00:11:24.975 --> 00:11:28.062
A Nightmare who,
I must say, I never trusted.

00:11:29.271 --> 00:11:30.731
[Dream] She is a shape-changer.

00:11:30.815 --> 00:11:32.983
It is not in her nature to be trustworthy.

00:11:34.068 --> 00:11:35.236
Who else?

00:11:36.821 --> 00:11:37.863
The Corinthian.

00:11:40.282 --> 00:11:42.034
[Dream] I assumed as much.

00:11:42.118 --> 00:11:45.037
Still feeding on the dreamers
he was meant to serve.

00:11:45.121 --> 00:11:47.581
-Yes.
-The last?

00:11:48.499 --> 00:11:50.084
The last is Fiddler's Green.

00:11:51.335 --> 00:11:53.295
-Fiddler's Green?
-[Lucienne] Hmm.

00:11:56.966 --> 00:11:58.718
[Dream] That is passing strange.

00:12:00.845 --> 00:12:04.390
He is, after all, vavasor of
his own dominion and always so reliable.

00:12:04.473 --> 00:12:05.516
[Lucienne] I know.

00:12:08.436 --> 00:12:11.605
This is my fault.
Had I been here, fulfilling my function--

00:12:11.689 --> 00:12:14.150
-It was not your fault, my lord.
-No?

00:12:15.443 --> 00:12:16.819
Then whose?

00:12:18.988 --> 00:12:21.407
I'm afraid there is yet more news.

00:12:21.490 --> 00:12:24.910
-Gossip, really, but…
-Go on.

00:12:26.370 --> 00:12:31.208
There are rumors
among the dream folk… of a vortex.

00:12:32.293 --> 00:12:34.253
Perhaps you might wish to investigate.

00:12:37.381 --> 00:12:40.509
The rumors are quite true.

00:12:41.635 --> 00:12:43.262
There is a vortex.

00:12:43.345 --> 00:12:47.475
A true annulet. The first of this era.

00:12:47.558 --> 00:12:51.270
Then you must hunt for it, sir.
It must be controlled.

00:12:55.483 --> 00:12:58.360
The vortex is a she, Lucienne.

00:12:59.153 --> 00:13:00.196
Not an "it."

00:13:01.197 --> 00:13:04.575
And the Endless are forbidden
from taking action against any mortal

00:13:04.658 --> 00:13:06.452
who is not an active threat.

00:13:06.535 --> 00:13:09.079
Yes, but should the threat become active?

00:13:09.163 --> 00:13:13.501
Then perhaps one of our problems
may prove a solution to the other three.

00:13:15.336 --> 00:13:17.296
She is a vortex, after all.

00:13:18.714 --> 00:13:21.342
Sooner or later,
she will draw the stray dreams to her.

00:13:23.469 --> 00:13:25.304
Is that not risky, Lord?

00:13:25.387 --> 00:13:29.308
She could destroy the Dreaming.
And the waking world in the process.

00:13:29.391 --> 00:13:32.478
-[Dream] I'm watching her.
-Yes, but only when she sleeps.

00:13:33.354 --> 00:13:35.940
Perhaps one of us should
surveil her in the waking world.

00:13:36.023 --> 00:13:40.194
I think it best I not leave
the Dreaming unattended for now.

00:13:40.778 --> 00:13:41.987
I could go.

00:13:43.322 --> 00:13:47.243
Very well. Lucienne will tell you
what to look for, Matthew.

00:13:48.327 --> 00:13:51.872
And what you see, I too will see.

00:13:53.374 --> 00:13:54.792
[Lyta] Rose?

00:13:56.794 --> 00:13:57.711
Wake up.

00:13:59.129 --> 00:14:00.005
We're here.

00:14:02.424 --> 00:14:04.134
I just had the weirdest dream.

00:14:08.097 --> 00:14:08.931
Thank you.

00:14:14.103 --> 00:14:15.020
[man] Miss Walker.

00:14:15.104 --> 00:14:16.772
Hi. I'm Rose.

00:14:17.690 --> 00:14:19.233
I'm Lyta Hall.

00:14:19.316 --> 00:14:21.443
Are you the attorney? Mr. Holdawell?

00:14:21.527 --> 00:14:22.736
It's Holdaway, miss.

00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:24.071
Sorry.

00:14:24.154 --> 00:14:27.324
And we call ourselves "solicitors"
on this side of the Atlantic.

00:14:28.117 --> 00:14:29.660
Is this the foundation headquarters?

00:14:29.743 --> 00:14:32.663
This is a private care home
for the elderly.

00:14:33.497 --> 00:14:34.999
My client is a resident.

00:14:35.583 --> 00:14:36.584
Shall we go in?

00:14:41.714 --> 00:14:43.716
[pleasant music playing]

00:14:44.258 --> 00:14:45.426
If you'll follow me.

00:14:52.558 --> 00:14:54.602
[Lyta] Your client runs the foundation?

00:14:54.685 --> 00:14:58.105
My client will explain everything
much better than I can, Miss Hall.

00:14:59.732 --> 00:15:01.483
Do you know what an annulet is?

00:15:01.567 --> 00:15:03.485
-A what?
-An annulet.

00:15:03.569 --> 00:15:06.322
It's a kind of ring, I believe. Old word.

00:15:06.405 --> 00:15:09.199
Where did such a young girl
run across such an old word?

00:15:09.283 --> 00:15:11.493
I'm not that young. I'm actually 21.

00:15:11.577 --> 00:15:13.537
No one ever believes me.

00:15:13.621 --> 00:15:16.206
And they always
ask to see my ID, it's annoying.

00:15:16.290 --> 00:15:18.417
What's annoying is when they stop asking.

00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:19.627
Trust me.

00:15:26.425 --> 00:15:28.719
-[knocking]
-[woman] Come in, please.

00:15:32.890 --> 00:15:33.891
[Rose] Thank you.

00:15:36.018 --> 00:15:37.144
You must be Rose.

00:15:37.227 --> 00:15:40.022
I am. And this is my friend, Lyta Hall.

00:15:41.190 --> 00:15:42.900
It's a pleasure to meet you both.

00:15:44.234 --> 00:15:46.654
My name is Unity. Unity Kincaid.

00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:49.740
-Thank you, Mr. Holdaway.
-Not at all.

00:15:51.241 --> 00:15:52.618
[door closes]

00:15:53.327 --> 00:15:55.704
He's very serious, isn't he? [chuckles]

00:15:56.872 --> 00:15:58.582
Please, come in.

00:15:59.208 --> 00:16:01.627
Thank you. Ooh.

00:16:01.710 --> 00:16:04.046
-Whose is this?
-Oh, that was mine when I was a girl.

00:16:07.967 --> 00:16:09.301
[Rose] It looks brand-new.

00:16:09.843 --> 00:16:11.470
It might as well be.

00:16:12.096 --> 00:16:14.014
I didn't get a chance to play with it.

00:16:14.723 --> 00:16:15.849
[Rose] Why not?

00:16:15.933 --> 00:16:17.893
Well, that's why you're here actually.

00:16:19.228 --> 00:16:21.981
The doll's house was a gift.
For my 12th birthday.

00:16:24.984 --> 00:16:27.778
The doctors tell me
that on that night, I fell ill

00:16:27.861 --> 00:16:30.739
with something called
encephalitis lethargica.

00:16:31.490 --> 00:16:33.283
[man] Rise and shine, dormouse.

00:16:33.367 --> 00:16:36.745
[Unity] I fell asleep,
and I didn't wake up.

00:16:37.413 --> 00:16:39.957
Luvvy? Unity?

00:16:42.209 --> 00:16:43.627
Until eight months ago.

00:16:44.378 --> 00:16:49.133
But in my dreams,
I had the most glorious life.

00:16:50.134 --> 00:16:52.469
I took over my father's business.

00:16:52.553 --> 00:16:54.847
And I met a man with golden eyes.

00:16:54.930 --> 00:16:56.515
And we had a baby.

00:16:58.642 --> 00:17:02.187
But it wasn't until I woke up
that I found out that none of it was real.

00:17:05.357 --> 00:17:06.567
Except for the baby.

00:17:08.277 --> 00:17:12.114
Apparently,
while I was asleep in hospital,

00:17:13.407 --> 00:17:14.783
I had a baby girl.

00:17:17.202 --> 00:17:19.872
They hushed it up at the time,
but Mr. Holdaway found out

00:17:19.955 --> 00:17:22.291
that she was adopted by a fine family.

00:17:22.374 --> 00:17:24.960
And that she grew up
to have a daughter of her own.

00:17:26.628 --> 00:17:27.755
Called Miranda.

00:17:29.798 --> 00:17:31.216
Miranda Walker.

00:17:32.885 --> 00:17:34.053
Your mother.

00:17:36.013 --> 00:17:37.931
I'm your great-grandmother, Rose.

00:17:38.807 --> 00:17:41.852
And I'm sorry to have
brought you here under false pretenses,

00:17:41.935 --> 00:17:45.481
but I thought that if it were explained
to you first, you might not have…

00:17:45.564 --> 00:17:46.774
You might not have come.

00:17:48.859 --> 00:17:50.986
And I don't think I could have borne that.

00:17:54.573 --> 00:17:55.449
[sighing] Oh.

00:18:02.456 --> 00:18:03.916
I'll let you catch up.

00:18:04.541 --> 00:18:06.418
-No. You don't have to--
-No, please stay.

00:18:06.502 --> 00:18:09.213
I'll come back. You two talk.

00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:13.801
[door opens]

00:18:15.886 --> 00:18:17.888
[door closes]

00:18:19.431 --> 00:18:21.600
[man] Thank you both
for coming all this way,

00:18:21.683 --> 00:18:24.436
but as co-chairs
of the planning committee,

00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:29.399
it falls to us to come up with
a suitable replacement for the Family Man.

00:18:29.483 --> 00:18:33.362
So, we need a new guest of honor.
Immediately, if not sooner.

00:18:33.445 --> 00:18:36.031
Do we have any other big names coming?

00:18:36.115 --> 00:18:38.992
-Um, Moon River.
-Mmm, no.

00:18:39.076 --> 00:18:40.869
Uh, the Candyman.

00:18:40.953 --> 00:18:44.623
Uh, we need a marquee player.
People have already bought tickets.

00:18:44.706 --> 00:18:46.375
Not as many people as last year.

00:18:46.458 --> 00:18:48.001
All the more reason to go big.

00:18:49.169 --> 00:18:51.755
Who's the one person we'd all pay to see?

00:18:54.383 --> 00:18:56.051
-[all] The Corinthian.
-Yeah.

00:18:57.136 --> 00:19:00.472
I reach out every year. No response.

00:19:05.352 --> 00:19:06.562
No.

00:19:06.645 --> 00:19:07.938
Thank you.

00:19:11.275 --> 00:19:12.734
How old do you think he is?

00:19:12.818 --> 00:19:13.694
The Corinthian?

00:19:13.777 --> 00:19:16.405
Oh. He's been around for forever.

00:19:16.488 --> 00:19:18.740
No, the waiter.

00:19:20.659 --> 00:19:22.369
[woman] Sixteen? Seventeen?

00:19:23.620 --> 00:19:24.538
Too old for you.

00:19:25.873 --> 00:19:26.999
He looks younger.

00:19:27.082 --> 00:19:30.294
Though there's probably been
more than one Corinthian over the years.

00:19:30.377 --> 00:19:34.464
Whoever the current one is,
his work is exquisite.

00:19:35.424 --> 00:19:37.676
This was last week. In DC.

00:19:40.137 --> 00:19:41.847
-Oh.
-Oh. [chuckles]

00:19:41.930 --> 00:19:44.808
So he's on the East Coast. He's not far.

00:19:45.392 --> 00:19:47.394
What do you think he does with the eyes?

00:19:47.477 --> 00:19:49.771
He's a collector. Same as us.

00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:53.859
I can invite him again
through the usual channels.

00:19:53.942 --> 00:19:58.447
No, if we want to get his attention,
we have to think like him.

00:19:59.990 --> 00:20:01.700
Act… like him.

00:20:04.077 --> 00:20:05.329
Are you suggesting we--

00:20:05.412 --> 00:20:07.206
Copycat the Corinthian?

00:20:07.289 --> 00:20:08.415
Might be fun.

00:20:08.498 --> 00:20:11.043
We do not plagiarize one another's work.

00:20:11.126 --> 00:20:12.502
We have a code.

00:20:12.586 --> 00:20:15.964
We also have over 100
serial killers coming to this thing.

00:20:16.048 --> 00:20:17.633
"Collectors." Please.

00:20:17.716 --> 00:20:20.427
And they paid good money
to see the Family Man.

00:20:20.510 --> 00:20:23.263
No. Absolutely not.

00:20:24.556 --> 00:20:27.517
Fine. Have it your way.

00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:31.480
Restroom?

00:20:37.277 --> 00:20:39.696
Do you think the Corinthian has a type?

00:20:40.781 --> 00:20:41.782
[knock on door]

00:20:43.909 --> 00:20:44.826
May I help you?

00:20:45.410 --> 00:20:47.162
Oh, you're not Rose Walker.

00:20:48.205 --> 00:20:49.456
No, I'm Carl.

00:20:50.082 --> 00:20:51.875
Rose's roommate?

00:20:51.959 --> 00:20:54.127
House-sitter. She's away.

00:20:54.211 --> 00:20:55.379
Ah.

00:20:56.296 --> 00:20:57.589
And you are?

00:20:57.673 --> 00:21:00.133
I guess you could say
I'm kind of a headhunter.

00:21:00.217 --> 00:21:01.927
Here to offer Rose a job.

00:21:02.594 --> 00:21:05.555
-Seriously?
-Do you know where I can find her?

00:21:06.139 --> 00:21:06.974
Uh…

00:21:07.057 --> 00:21:10.602
She's traveling at the moment,
but I can give her a message.

00:21:11.311 --> 00:21:14.189
Hmm. Yeah, how long
do you think she'll be away?

00:21:15.399 --> 00:21:16.275
A week.

00:21:17.067 --> 00:21:20.112
But… you're welcome to wait.

00:21:22.948 --> 00:21:25.409
[man] The Corinthian's technique
is meticulous.

00:21:25.492 --> 00:21:26.368
Elegant.

00:21:27.035 --> 00:21:30.122
A convincing collection
would take months of research.

00:21:30.205 --> 00:21:31.665
We'd need the right tools.

00:21:31.748 --> 00:21:35.168
Plus, why would the Corinthian
even care about a copycat?

00:21:35.252 --> 00:21:36.295
[man] Well, I'd care.

00:21:36.378 --> 00:21:38.964
If someone was out there
taking credit for my work,

00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:44.428
I'd find them and I'd make sure
they never did it again.

00:21:45.012 --> 00:21:47.306
That's another good reason not to do it.

00:21:47.931 --> 00:21:49.558
Right. That settles it.

00:21:49.641 --> 00:21:51.351
-We've decided--
-[woman] We need to go.

00:21:52.311 --> 00:21:56.231
We can't go. We have no guest of honor
and no plan moving forward.

00:21:56.315 --> 00:21:58.442
I want dessert. Where's the waiter?

00:21:58.525 --> 00:21:59.651
We have a plan.

00:22:00.319 --> 00:22:02.904
We are sending a message
to the Corinthian.

00:22:04.156 --> 00:22:05.824
And the waiter isn't coming back.

00:22:10.620 --> 00:22:11.830
Whoa.

00:22:15.167 --> 00:22:17.377
[Rose] I'll just get Lyta. Be right back.

00:22:22.549 --> 00:22:23.592
[the Maiden] Rose.

00:22:24.134 --> 00:22:25.302
[the Mother] Rosebud.

00:22:25.385 --> 00:22:27.429
[the Crone] Rose Walker.

00:22:34.519 --> 00:22:35.645
[the Maiden] Hello, Rosie.

00:22:36.313 --> 00:22:38.190
[the Mother] Come in, my butterfly.

00:22:38.273 --> 00:22:40.984
You are at a crossroads, Rose Walker.

00:22:42.277 --> 00:22:45.197
How do you know my name? Who are you?

00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:47.657
Names, names, names.

00:22:47.741 --> 00:22:50.786
Each name
is but a single aspect of the whole.

00:22:50.869 --> 00:22:53.330
Be satisfied
with the trinity you have, love.

00:22:53.413 --> 00:22:55.916
You wouldn't want to
meet us as the Kindly Ones.

00:22:55.999 --> 00:22:58.919
We can only caution you, sister.

00:22:59.002 --> 00:23:00.670
We can't protect you.

00:23:00.754 --> 00:23:02.464
Protect me from…

00:23:02.547 --> 00:23:03.965
From life, my posy.

00:23:04.049 --> 00:23:06.635
And the things that hover beyond life.

00:23:06.718 --> 00:23:08.512
Thrashing theirselves against it.

00:23:08.595 --> 00:23:11.932
-Beware dreams.
-And houses.

00:23:13.058 --> 00:23:14.184
What do you mean?

00:23:14.267 --> 00:23:16.561
[sighs] You ask the wrong question.

00:23:16.645 --> 00:23:18.688
Had you asked the right one,

00:23:18.772 --> 00:23:21.149
we could have warned you
against the Corinthian.

00:23:21.233 --> 00:23:22.901
Told you about Jed.

00:23:22.984 --> 00:23:25.320
And about Morpheus.

00:23:32.244 --> 00:23:33.578
What are you doing in here?

00:23:34.287 --> 00:23:35.247
I…

00:23:40.669 --> 00:23:43.088
I think I'm really jet-lagged.

00:23:43.171 --> 00:23:44.214
[Lyta chuckles]

00:23:49.678 --> 00:23:51.346
[Unity] How do you two know each other?

00:23:51.430 --> 00:23:54.474
-We're neighbors, actually.
-Same building. One floor apart.

00:23:54.558 --> 00:23:59.062
And when my mom got sick,
Lyta and her husband basically adopted me.

00:23:59.146 --> 00:23:59.980
[all chuckle]

00:24:00.063 --> 00:24:02.149
We felt like Rose adopted us.

00:24:02.232 --> 00:24:05.610
Which makes you
and your husband my family too.

00:24:07.487 --> 00:24:09.948
Should I send him
a plane ticket so he can join us?

00:24:10.699 --> 00:24:15.120
That's very sweet of you,
but… Hector passed away about a year ago.

00:24:15.203 --> 00:24:16.204
Oh, no.

00:24:16.288 --> 00:24:18.582
[Lyta] It was an accident.
Someone ran a red light.

00:24:18.665 --> 00:24:20.917
-I'm so sorry.
-[Lyta] Don't be.

00:24:21.001 --> 00:24:22.878
Hector and I met in college.

00:24:22.961 --> 00:24:24.963
We were architecture majors.

00:24:25.046 --> 00:24:27.424
We opened our own firm.
We had years together.

00:24:28.383 --> 00:24:30.343
But it's never enough years though, is it?

00:24:31.678 --> 00:24:35.515
It seems we've all had our lives
terribly interrupted, haven't we?

00:24:36.433 --> 00:24:39.811
Maybe that's what life is.
Just a series of interruptions.

00:24:40.812 --> 00:24:42.314
And reconnections.

00:24:42.898 --> 00:24:44.316
[both chuckle]

00:24:44.399 --> 00:24:47.527
Now, we just need to locate your brother.

00:24:47.611 --> 00:24:51.156
I was hoping, uh,
to hire a private investigator.

00:24:51.239 --> 00:24:54.493
Or maybe go down to
Cape Kennedy myself at some point.

00:24:54.576 --> 00:24:55.619
Well, I think you should.

00:24:55.702 --> 00:24:56.620
I will.

00:24:56.703 --> 00:24:59.581
Uh, I just need to find a job first.

00:25:00.290 --> 00:25:01.875
What if I employ you?

00:25:02.501 --> 00:25:03.543
To do what?

00:25:03.627 --> 00:25:05.754
To locate my great-grandson.

00:25:06.463 --> 00:25:09.382
Look, I'll pay for everything.
Travel. Expenses.

00:25:09.466 --> 00:25:11.343
And a salary, of course.

00:25:11.426 --> 00:25:13.762
-[laughs softly] Unity, I--
-Don't worry.

00:25:13.845 --> 00:25:15.055
There's plenty of money.

00:25:15.722 --> 00:25:18.975
Our family owned Kincaid Sugar.

00:25:19.059 --> 00:25:20.894
-They did?
-Oh, my God.

00:25:20.977 --> 00:25:25.482
You'd be doing me a favor.
I want to meet my great-grandson.

00:25:26.233 --> 00:25:27.984
Lyta, will you go with her?

00:25:28.068 --> 00:25:29.110
Let's all go.

00:25:29.194 --> 00:25:31.488
No, no, no. I'd only slow you down.

00:25:32.405 --> 00:25:34.616
But I'll be with you in spirit.

00:25:35.575 --> 00:25:37.077
No. No, more than that.

00:25:38.954 --> 00:25:41.331
My parents gave me this a long time ago.

00:25:45.293 --> 00:25:46.294
It's yours now.

00:25:49.130 --> 00:25:50.757
Thank you. [chuckles]

00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:52.133
It's a gold annulet.

00:25:56.137 --> 00:25:57.430
What? What's wrong?

00:25:59.224 --> 00:26:05.438
I… I had a dream in the car, uh,
on the way here about an annulet.

00:26:06.064 --> 00:26:08.275
Did you? Well, then…

00:26:09.776 --> 00:26:11.278
May all our dreams come true.

00:26:11.820 --> 00:26:12.696
[chuckles]

00:26:14.364 --> 00:26:17.158
This is the best house-sitting gig
I've ever had.

00:26:19.327 --> 00:26:20.495
[the Corinthian grunts]

00:26:21.788 --> 00:26:24.332
Rose certainly left you plenty to read.

00:26:24.416 --> 00:26:26.418
[sinister music playing]

00:26:26.501 --> 00:26:27.711
[Carl] You a big reader?

00:26:29.838 --> 00:26:31.006
I prefer people.

00:26:31.089 --> 00:26:33.925
[Carl] Hmm. That's good news for people.

00:26:41.558 --> 00:26:43.310
You, uh, never told me about the job.

00:26:45.562 --> 00:26:46.980
The one you found for Rose.

00:26:47.063 --> 00:26:48.064
Oh.

00:26:49.399 --> 00:26:51.234
I want Rose to come and work for me.

00:26:51.860 --> 00:26:54.654
See, I left my old job to be independent.

00:26:55.238 --> 00:26:58.450
I think, with Rose at my side,
I can put my boss out of business.

00:27:00.660 --> 00:27:04.039
Start something new that's… just ours.

00:27:11.171 --> 00:27:12.380
[Carl] Something wrong?

00:27:13.089 --> 00:27:14.591
Yeah. I gotta get to work.

00:27:15.342 --> 00:27:16.718
More headhunting?

00:27:16.801 --> 00:27:18.219
Well, it looks like it.

00:27:19.638 --> 00:27:22.891
You sure you don't have time
for just one more round?

00:27:24.017 --> 00:27:26.645
Maybe this time without the dark glasses.

00:27:41.034 --> 00:27:42.535
Would you ask Rose to call me?

00:27:53.296 --> 00:27:57.300
There she is.
"Rose Walker. 21 years of age."

00:27:57.384 --> 00:27:59.886
"Mother, deceased. Father, deceased."

00:27:59.969 --> 00:28:01.262
Poor kid.

00:28:01.346 --> 00:28:05.058
There is a brother, Jed Walker.
And someone else.

00:28:05.684 --> 00:28:06.685
Is it true?

00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:12.148
Yes. The plans for the new celestarium
have been approved.

00:28:12.232 --> 00:28:16.569
I'm not here to talk construction.
I'm here to talk about the vortex.

00:28:16.653 --> 00:28:19.823
Lord Morpheus is already
monitoring her dreams.

00:28:19.906 --> 00:28:21.074
He better be.

00:28:21.157 --> 00:28:23.326
And sending Matthew
to watch her in the waking world.

00:28:23.410 --> 00:28:25.412
What? Who's Matthew?

00:28:25.495 --> 00:28:27.288
Merv. It's me.

00:28:27.997 --> 00:28:31.251
Stop. He's sending the new kid?

00:28:31.334 --> 00:28:32.168
Why not?

00:28:32.794 --> 00:28:36.965
You've been here for five minutes.
Do you even know what to watch for?

00:28:37.048 --> 00:28:38.925
No. Do you want to go?

00:28:39.008 --> 00:28:40.802
[scoffs] I do not.

00:28:40.885 --> 00:28:42.971
Then tell me what to watch for.

00:28:43.763 --> 00:28:44.597
Oh.

00:28:46.015 --> 00:28:48.059
Any unusual behavior.

00:28:48.143 --> 00:28:52.397
Said the pumpkin to the talking bird.
Can you be a little more specific?

00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:53.481
[groans softly]

00:28:53.565 --> 00:28:57.861
If the vortex manifests,
she would do so in her dreams,

00:28:57.944 --> 00:29:00.321
which of course reflect her waking life.

00:29:00.405 --> 00:29:03.742
So, look for any signs of shock or trauma.

00:29:03.825 --> 00:29:06.828
Anything that could
trigger her into killing us all.

00:29:06.911 --> 00:29:09.122
So, basically anything.

00:29:10.206 --> 00:29:12.751
-Basically, yes.
-[chuckles] Kid's a natural.

00:29:12.834 --> 00:29:15.253
Oh, and, birdie, you see anything,

00:29:15.336 --> 00:29:17.505
you tell Lucienne
before you tell the boss.

00:29:17.589 --> 00:29:19.257
-Mervyn.
-[Merv] Stop.

00:29:19.340 --> 00:29:22.469
Everyone knows
you secretly run this place.

00:29:22.552 --> 00:29:24.971
-[sighs]
-I got no problem with that.

00:29:25.054 --> 00:29:27.640
-[Merv] Attabird.
-Thank you, Matthew.

00:29:29.476 --> 00:29:33.146
-Now, about the new celestarium--
-[Merv] Later, Loosh.

00:29:33.229 --> 00:29:34.856
[intense music playing]

00:29:54.584 --> 00:29:56.586
-[man] Rose.
-[Rose] Hal.

00:29:56.669 --> 00:29:57.921
[Hal] Welcome home.

00:29:58.004 --> 00:29:59.297
-Thank you.
-Oh.

00:30:00.089 --> 00:30:01.257
How does it feel to be back?

00:30:02.175 --> 00:30:04.761
Cape Kennedy is exactly how I remember it.

00:30:04.844 --> 00:30:07.847
Yeah, change is not something
that happens in Florida.

00:30:07.931 --> 00:30:10.058
Oh, you must be Lyta. I'm Hal Carter.

00:30:10.141 --> 00:30:11.893
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

00:30:11.976 --> 00:30:13.520
Hal owns the B and B.

00:30:13.603 --> 00:30:17.357
Yeah, it was my grandmother's house
once upon a time, but it's better now.

00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:19.067
-Oh, let me.
-Thank you.

00:30:20.068 --> 00:30:22.737
-Were you guys friends before?
-No.

00:30:22.821 --> 00:30:24.948
We met on the phone.
When I made the reservation.

00:30:25.532 --> 00:30:27.659
[Hal] I may have told Rose my life story.

00:30:27.742 --> 00:30:29.160
I definitely told Hal mine.

00:30:29.244 --> 00:30:31.246
Hey! Are you Rose and Lyta?

00:30:31.329 --> 00:30:32.205
-[Lyta] Hi.
-Hi.

00:30:32.288 --> 00:30:33.706
-I'm Ken.
-I'm Barbie.

00:30:35.250 --> 00:30:37.544
-It's terrible.
-We know. [laughs]

00:30:37.627 --> 00:30:40.213
-We're your downstairs neighbors.
-Well, not for much longer.

00:30:40.296 --> 00:30:43.925
We're off to look at some houses.
But we're all going out tonight, right?

00:30:44.551 --> 00:30:45.802
If you're not too jet-lagged.

00:30:45.885 --> 00:30:47.804
Uh, no. That sounds great.

00:30:47.887 --> 00:30:48.721
Great.

00:30:49.472 --> 00:30:51.599
And good luck today. With the foster lady?

00:30:51.683 --> 00:30:52.642
Thank you.

00:30:53.393 --> 00:30:55.353
I may have told them
your life story as well,

00:30:55.436 --> 00:30:58.314
but it's just to
spread the word about your brother.

00:30:58.398 --> 00:31:00.233
It's not because we were gossiping.

00:31:01.985 --> 00:31:04.237
We were sorry
to hear about your mother's death.

00:31:05.530 --> 00:31:07.866
-[whispers] Her husband.
-Oh, and your husband's.

00:31:08.658 --> 00:31:11.369
Chantal and Zelda live upstairs
across the hall from you.

00:31:11.452 --> 00:31:14.330
We possess
the largest collection of stuffed spiders

00:31:14.414 --> 00:31:16.165
in private hands on the Eastern Seaboard.

00:31:16.791 --> 00:31:17.625
Oh.

00:31:17.709 --> 00:31:20.086
Would you like to see them?
Perhaps later this evening?

00:31:21.296 --> 00:31:23.172
-[whispers indistinctly]
-Oh.

00:31:23.256 --> 00:31:25.258
Zelda would like to know
if you've invited Gilbert.

00:31:25.341 --> 00:31:27.552
Yes, I slipped a note under his door.

00:31:27.635 --> 00:31:30.638
Oh. Until tonight, new housemates.

00:31:30.722 --> 00:31:31.931
[giggles]

00:31:33.057 --> 00:31:34.559
They're really very sweet.

00:31:34.642 --> 00:31:35.852
Are they…

00:31:35.935 --> 00:31:37.979
Sisters? Mother? Daughter? Lovers?

00:31:38.062 --> 00:31:39.063
[whispers] Nobody knows.

00:31:39.147 --> 00:31:41.691
[normally] But I feel
knowing would somehow ruin it.

00:31:41.774 --> 00:31:42.859
And who's Gilbert?

00:31:42.942 --> 00:31:44.819
Gilbert lives in the attic room.

00:31:44.903 --> 00:31:47.614
We don't see much of him.
He just sits up there and reads.

00:31:47.697 --> 00:31:48.740
So, is that it?

00:31:49.490 --> 00:31:51.826
Or is there anyone else
who knows everything about us?

00:31:51.910 --> 00:31:53.369
No secrets in this house.

00:31:53.453 --> 00:31:56.748
We're just one big, odd, happy family.

00:31:56.831 --> 00:31:58.166
Sorry.

00:31:58.249 --> 00:32:00.335
[Rose] Don't be. Family's why we're here.

00:32:02.462 --> 00:32:04.047
[woman] I'm sorry, Miss Walker,

00:32:04.130 --> 00:32:07.467
but as I told your mother's attorney
on the phone and in my emails,

00:32:07.550 --> 00:32:10.219
I cannot, by law,
give out your brother's information.

00:32:10.303 --> 00:32:12.764
If you'd like to leave
your information for Jed's parents--

00:32:12.847 --> 00:32:16.434
-They're not his parents.
-They are while he is in their care.

00:32:16.517 --> 00:32:18.811
-But I'm his sister.
-I understand that.

00:32:18.895 --> 00:32:23.441
But you have to understand that,
as such, you have no legal claim to him.

00:32:24.067 --> 00:32:26.945
Could you just be
a fucking human being for a second?

00:32:27.028 --> 00:32:28.404
-Please?
-Rosie.

00:32:28.488 --> 00:32:30.573
No. We came all this way.

00:32:31.950 --> 00:32:36.204
My parents are dead, Miss Rubio.
Jed's the only family I have left.

00:32:36.829 --> 00:32:37.789
He's it.

00:32:38.581 --> 00:32:41.960
I just want to see him or talk to him.

00:32:42.752 --> 00:32:44.170
Just let him know I'm here.

00:32:47.882 --> 00:32:53.054
Rose, if I tell you
where your brother is, then what?

00:32:53.763 --> 00:32:54.764
I get in touch.

00:32:56.432 --> 00:32:58.309
I tell him about our mom.

00:33:00.061 --> 00:33:02.855
I ask him how he is. If he's okay.

00:33:02.939 --> 00:33:04.399
[Rubio] What do you do when he says,

00:33:04.482 --> 00:33:07.068
"I don't wanna live with these people.
I wanna live with you."

00:33:07.944 --> 00:33:09.195
Is that what you want?

00:33:09.821 --> 00:33:14.701
Are you prepared
to raise a 12-year-old boy by yourself?

00:33:14.784 --> 00:33:15.868
At your age?

00:33:16.911 --> 00:33:19.455
Do you have a job? Health care?

00:33:26.838 --> 00:33:29.716
Look. If it helps,

00:33:31.217 --> 00:33:33.803
Jed's fosters were friends of your dad's.

00:33:33.886 --> 00:33:34.929
They were?

00:33:36.764 --> 00:33:39.934
They took Jed in,
applied to be his fosters,

00:33:40.685 --> 00:33:44.897
and now they're getting 800 a month,
so Jed's doing just fine.

Well, I didn't make any new friends
at the foster agency.

to be more of an homage.

to get out without popping them.

trying to get my attention.

[the Corinthian] Hmm.

00:40:09.073 --> 00:40:13.577
We hoped that
since you are the current Corinthian,

00:40:14.245 --> 00:40:16.455
you might deliver the keynote speech.

A dream
that the Corinthian inspired. [chuckles]

00:40:35.266 --> 00:40:39.019
Oh. Well, in that case,
I wonder if I might bring a guest.

00:40:39.103 --> 00:40:40.563

our shared dreams to a whole new level.

of the guest or preferred sobriquet?

of the living, but I cannot find him.

00:41:33.991 --> 00:41:36.494
No. Nor I, my lord.

All humans are connected to the Dreaming.

They spend a third of their life here.

00:41:44.793 --> 00:41:47.588
Breaking that connection
would require knowledge.

00:41:48.797 --> 00:41:50.007
And power.

00:41:54.970 --> 00:41:59.642
the last nightmare Jed Walker had
before he disappeared was of Gault.

00:41:59.725 --> 00:42:02.269

from the Dreaming?

00:42:05.147 --> 00:42:05.981
Why?

He's Rose Walker's brother.

00:42:11.987 --> 00:42:13.489
