WEBVTT

00:00:11.052 --> 00:00:13.054
[intense music playing]

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:23.732
[indistinct chatter]

00:00:32.115 --> 00:00:33.491
[woman speaking indistinctly]

00:00:36.369 --> 00:00:37.787
[dog barking]

00:00:52.635 --> 00:00:53.511
[man] Heads up!

00:00:55.221 --> 00:00:57.849
Sorry, man. Nice catch, though.

00:00:59.517 --> 00:01:00.351
Thank you.

00:01:01.561 --> 00:01:02.562
[chuckles softly]

00:01:06.232 --> 00:01:07.067
Franklin.

00:01:07.692 --> 00:01:09.944
Come on, Franklin. What you waitin' for?

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:23.249
What are you doin'?

00:01:25.335 --> 00:01:26.544
I'm feeding the pigeons.

00:01:30.507 --> 00:01:32.425
"You do that too much,
you know what you get?"

00:01:34.344 --> 00:01:35.345
"Fat pigeons."

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.643
That's from Mary Poppins.
Did you ever see it?

00:01:42.519 --> 00:01:43.353
No.

00:01:43.436 --> 00:01:44.646
[girl giggling]

00:01:52.278 --> 00:01:53.530
Okay, so what's the matter?

00:01:54.114 --> 00:01:55.198
What do you mean?

00:01:55.281 --> 00:01:58.451
I can tell something's wrong.
I mean, look at you.

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:01.871
Sittin' here, moping, pigeon-feeding.

00:02:02.914 --> 00:02:04.040
It's not like you.

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.086
No. Perhaps it isn't.

00:02:08.711 --> 00:02:10.463
I don't know what's wrong, but…

00:02:12.215 --> 00:02:13.133
You're right.

00:02:15.051 --> 00:02:16.427
Something is the matter.

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:27.355
When they captured me,
I just had one thought.

00:02:30.066 --> 00:02:31.067
Vengeance.

00:02:32.735 --> 00:02:35.113
It wasn't as satisfying as I'd expected.

00:02:36.447 --> 00:02:39.367
Meanwhile, my kingdom had fallen apart.

00:02:40.535 --> 00:02:44.622
My tools long since stolen and scattered.

00:02:46.166 --> 00:02:50.253
And so I embarked upon
a journey to find them.

00:02:52.338 --> 00:02:53.256
Which I did.

00:02:55.341 --> 00:02:58.011
I'm now more powerful
than I have been in eons.

00:02:59.929 --> 00:03:00.847
And yet…

00:03:06.686 --> 00:03:08.396
Here you are, feeding the pigeons.

00:03:09.397 --> 00:03:11.357
You see, until then,

00:03:13.526 --> 00:03:15.486
I'd had a true quest.

00:03:16.779 --> 00:03:21.659
A purpose beyond my function
and then suddenly, it was over, and…

00:03:24.787 --> 00:03:26.372
I felt disappointed.

00:03:28.416 --> 00:03:29.459
Let down.

00:03:31.169 --> 00:03:32.170
Empty.

00:03:33.338 --> 00:03:34.422
Does that make sense?

00:03:34.923 --> 00:03:38.343
I was so sure that once
I got everything back, I'd feel good.

00:03:40.303 --> 00:03:42.764
But in some ways
I feel worse than when I started.

00:03:43.598 --> 00:03:44.682
I feel like…

00:03:48.228 --> 00:03:49.145
Nothing.

00:03:53.316 --> 00:03:54.150
There.

00:03:55.693 --> 00:03:56.653
You asked.

00:04:03.743 --> 00:04:05.370
You could have called me, you know.

00:04:05.453 --> 00:04:07.163
I didn't want to worry you.

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:09.582
Oh, I don't believe it.

00:04:10.667 --> 00:04:12.043
Let me tell you something, Dream.

00:04:12.627 --> 00:04:15.505
And I'm only gonna say this once,
so you better pay attention.

00:04:15.588 --> 00:04:19.133
You are utterly the stupidest,

00:04:19.217 --> 00:04:23.137
most self-centered, pathetic excuse
for an anthropomorphic personification

00:04:23.221 --> 00:04:25.473
on this or any other plane.

00:04:25.556 --> 00:04:29.018
Feeling sorry for yourself
because your little game is over

00:04:29.102 --> 00:04:32.313
and you haven't got the balls
to go out and find a new one.

00:04:34.148 --> 00:04:35.692
You're as bad as Desire.

00:04:36.276 --> 00:04:37.193
No, worse.

00:04:39.821 --> 00:04:42.615
Did it never occur to you
that I would be worried about you?

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:44.200
-I didn't think you--
-Exactly.

00:04:44.867 --> 00:04:46.369
You didn't think.

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:48.496
[man] Heads up!

00:04:50.498 --> 00:04:51.332
[Franklin] Wow.

00:04:52.166 --> 00:04:55.003
You're as good as your… friend there.

00:04:56.129 --> 00:04:58.840
He's not my friend. He's my brother.
And he's an idiot.

00:04:58.923 --> 00:05:00.425
I'm just feeding the birds.

00:05:03.177 --> 00:05:06.848
Look, I can't stay here all day.
I've got work to do.

00:05:09.017 --> 00:05:12.270
You can come with me if you want,
or you can stay here and sulk.

00:05:14.397 --> 00:05:16.065
I'll come with you, I suppose.

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:18.651
Well, don't do me any favors.

00:05:23.072 --> 00:05:24.073
[chuckles softly]

00:05:24.824 --> 00:05:29.412
Sorry, before you go,
um, could I maybe see you again?

00:05:29.996 --> 00:05:32.582
Sure, Franklin. You'll see me again.

00:05:33.166 --> 00:05:34.083
Seriously?

00:05:35.084 --> 00:05:35.918
Soon.

00:05:36.836 --> 00:05:37.837
Okay, cool.

00:05:38.421 --> 00:05:40.423
Yeah, let me just get your number and…

00:05:41.632 --> 00:05:42.967
Wait, how did you know my…

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:49.640
[man] Come on, Franklin!
Are you playin' or not?

00:05:50.266 --> 00:05:52.268
[indistinct chatter]

00:05:54.729 --> 00:05:55.938
Look!

00:05:56.022 --> 00:05:58.441
[gasps] Yum!

00:05:58.524 --> 00:05:59.567
Okay, two, please.

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:00.860
None for me, thank you.

00:06:00.943 --> 00:06:01.986
They're good for you.

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:03.988
-I'm not hungry.
-You can just have it later.

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:09.285
Just one. Thanks.

00:06:11.204 --> 00:06:13.456
-There you go. It's a gift.
-Thank you.

00:06:13.539 --> 00:06:15.708
Aw. Thank you.

00:06:16.667 --> 00:06:17.627
So nice.

00:06:19.295 --> 00:06:21.589
Mmm. That is delicious.

00:06:22.548 --> 00:06:23.383
What?

00:06:27.345 --> 00:06:28.513
You are good with them.

00:06:29.597 --> 00:06:30.431
Apples?

00:06:31.391 --> 00:06:33.476
-Humans.
-Mmm.

00:06:34.936 --> 00:06:35.770
Bite?

00:06:36.896 --> 00:06:37.897
No, thank you.

00:06:40.817 --> 00:06:44.529
Hmm. Have you seen any of the others
since you've been back?

00:06:46.697 --> 00:06:47.532
Have you?

00:06:49.033 --> 00:06:50.493
Mmm… Mmm.

00:06:50.576 --> 00:06:53.121
We did have one family dinner
when you were away.

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:55.123
The twins were in high spirits.

00:06:55.748 --> 00:06:57.583
Mmm, Desire was, anyway.

00:06:58.543 --> 00:07:00.294
With me gone, I have no doubt.

00:07:02.004 --> 00:07:03.089
I don't know.

00:07:03.172 --> 00:07:05.842
I think Desire missed having
their usual sparring partner

00:07:05.925 --> 00:07:07.051
across the dinner table.

00:07:09.887 --> 00:07:11.139
Any word of the prodigal?

00:07:13.391 --> 00:07:14.225
No.

00:07:15.393 --> 00:07:16.394
Still missing.

00:07:18.062 --> 00:07:19.689
You were both missed.

00:07:26.988 --> 00:07:28.239
"How are you, sis?"

00:07:28.322 --> 00:07:29.866
"How have you been keeping?"

00:07:29.949 --> 00:07:33.244
Aw. I'm well, Dream. Thanks for asking.

00:07:36.497 --> 00:07:38.082
How are you, my sister?

00:07:39.041 --> 00:07:40.376
How have you been keeping?

00:07:42.628 --> 00:07:44.088
I'm worried about my brother.

00:07:46.549 --> 00:07:47.967
And I'm enjoying this apple.

00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:50.052
[violin music playing in distance]

00:07:53.014 --> 00:07:54.015
Can you hear it?

00:07:58.561 --> 00:07:59.896
I know this piece.

00:08:03.441 --> 00:08:05.776
I haven't heard it in 200 years.

00:08:10.823 --> 00:08:11.657
Come on.

00:08:15.369 --> 00:08:17.371
[violin music continues]

00:08:24.921 --> 00:08:26.672
[coughing]

00:08:27.798 --> 00:08:31.719
No. Don't stop, please.

00:08:32.678 --> 00:08:35.056
Uh, sorry for the noise.

00:08:35.139 --> 00:08:36.849
It's not noise. It's Schubert.

00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:38.935
Keep going.

00:08:39.018 --> 00:08:42.021
I can't. He never finished it. [chuckles]

00:08:43.314 --> 00:08:44.690
All we have is a fragment.

00:08:46.067 --> 00:08:48.069
Oh, forgive me, I… I am Harry.

00:08:49.695 --> 00:08:51.030
I know who you are, Harry.

00:08:53.199 --> 00:08:55.201
[pleasant music playing]

00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:00.331
Do you know who I am?

00:09:07.088 --> 00:09:09.924
No. Not yet. Please.

00:09:11.050 --> 00:09:12.343
It's time.

00:09:17.473 --> 00:09:18.432
[Harry] Can I just…

00:09:19.976 --> 00:09:23.229
There's something I have to say.
If that's all right.

00:09:23.312 --> 00:09:24.188
Of course.

00:09:35.074 --> 00:09:36.409
[praying in Hebrew]

00:09:40.496 --> 00:09:46.961
Hear, O Israel:
The Lord is our God. The Lord is One.

00:10:03.519 --> 00:10:05.438
[chuckles]

00:10:05.521 --> 00:10:07.231
I'm glad I said the Shema.

00:10:07.773 --> 00:10:11.819
My old man always said
it would guarantee you a place in Heaven.

00:10:13.070 --> 00:10:14.572
If you believe in Heaven.

00:10:14.655 --> 00:10:15.698
Hmm?

00:10:20.328 --> 00:10:21.954
I look so old.

00:10:23.331 --> 00:10:24.665
So empty.

00:10:28.210 --> 00:10:30.504
So, I'm dead.

00:10:32.048 --> 00:10:33.007
Now what?

00:10:34.216 --> 00:10:35.968
Now's when you find out, Harry.

00:10:36.052 --> 00:10:37.928
[enthralling music playing]

00:10:43.434 --> 00:10:44.852
[wings flapping]

00:10:59.158 --> 00:10:59.992
You ready?

00:11:15.299 --> 00:11:17.426
I thought he was sweet. Didn't you?

00:11:18.678 --> 00:11:21.138
[Dream] Sweet? I don't know.

00:11:22.556 --> 00:11:23.391
Perhaps.

00:11:27.103 --> 00:11:28.020
My sister…

00:11:28.688 --> 00:11:29.522
Yeah?

00:11:31.148 --> 00:11:33.901
When I was captured,
it wasn't me they were looking for.

00:11:36.612 --> 00:11:37.446
It was you.

00:11:41.992 --> 00:11:45.413
Yeah, I know.

00:11:50.126 --> 00:11:51.127
[Death sighs]

00:11:53.379 --> 00:11:54.338
What are you doing?

00:11:54.422 --> 00:11:55.673
I'm taking my shoes off.

00:11:56.298 --> 00:11:57.967
You should take yours off too.

00:11:58.050 --> 00:12:00.469
It's good to touch the Earth
with your bare feet.

00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:02.346
It's grounding.

00:12:03.472 --> 00:12:06.100
Come on,
I don't want to miss the next one.

00:12:10.688 --> 00:12:12.690
[indistinct chatter]

00:12:18.154 --> 00:12:19.613
[man whistles]

00:12:19.697 --> 00:12:20.531
Hi, Sam.

00:12:23.325 --> 00:12:24.160
Oh.

00:12:25.453 --> 00:12:27.872
[chuckles] Hi. I'm sorry. Do I know you?

00:12:35.379 --> 00:12:36.255
Oh, no.

00:12:37.798 --> 00:12:39.884
No, no.

00:12:40.551 --> 00:12:42.720
I need to talk to my wife
for, like, one second.

00:12:42.803 --> 00:12:43.679
Sam…

00:12:43.763 --> 00:12:44.847
You don't understand.

00:12:44.930 --> 00:12:47.475
All our flight information is on my phone.

00:12:47.558 --> 00:12:49.226
I just need to give her the code.

00:12:50.060 --> 00:12:51.395
I'm so sorry, Sam.

00:12:51.479 --> 00:12:53.147
But we're on our honeymoon.

00:12:53.230 --> 00:12:54.273
Your time is up.

00:12:56.150 --> 00:12:57.026
Sam?

00:13:03.866 --> 00:13:04.742
Sam?

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:07.077
Come on, hon.

00:13:20.966 --> 00:13:22.009
Sam!

00:13:25.596 --> 00:13:26.555
Sam!

00:13:28.682 --> 00:13:31.977
[sobbing] Sam… Sam!

00:13:32.728 --> 00:13:34.021
[Dream] How do you do it?

00:13:34.688 --> 00:13:36.106
-Do what?
-This.

00:13:36.190 --> 00:13:38.317
Be there, for all of them?

00:13:41.529 --> 00:13:44.323
I have a job to do. And I do it.

00:13:46.742 --> 00:13:50.371
When the first living thing existed,
I was there.

00:13:50.996 --> 00:13:54.583
When the last living thing dies,
I'll put the chairs on the table,

00:13:54.667 --> 00:13:56.210
turn out the lights and…

00:13:57.127 --> 00:13:59.296
lock the universe behind me when I leave.

00:14:00.297 --> 00:14:02.216
And I'm not there for all of them.

00:14:03.384 --> 00:14:05.010
There are exceptions.

00:14:06.053 --> 00:14:07.388
Mad Hettie.

00:14:07.471 --> 00:14:10.224
And then there's your ongoing project.

00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:12.893
How's he faring up after all this time?

00:14:12.977 --> 00:14:15.855
-Who? Hob Gadling?
-Hmm.

00:14:16.689 --> 00:14:19.483
I don't know.
I was forced to miss our last appointment.

00:14:20.693 --> 00:14:22.778
Well, I'm sure he'd love to see you.

00:14:24.196 --> 00:14:26.031
They're never too keen to see me, though.

00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:29.201
Does it not bother you?

00:14:30.494 --> 00:14:34.290
I actually used to think
I had the hardest job in all our family.

00:14:34.373 --> 00:14:35.291
Oh, did you?

00:14:35.374 --> 00:14:36.792
They fear the Sunless Lands,

00:14:36.876 --> 00:14:39.962
yet they enter your realm
every night without fear.

00:14:40.045 --> 00:14:42.798
And yet I am far more terrible than you.

00:14:43.382 --> 00:14:44.383
[chuckles]

00:14:46.677 --> 00:14:48.178
It was fine in the beginning.

00:14:48.262 --> 00:14:50.514
Dying and living were new things

00:14:50.598 --> 00:14:54.560
and people did them with the enthusiasm
they always bring to new things.

00:14:55.728 --> 00:14:59.565
And then after a bit, it just got harder.

00:15:00.190 --> 00:15:01.442
But you continued.

00:15:05.279 --> 00:15:07.239
I thought about giving up.

00:15:09.617 --> 00:15:10.701
Walking out.

00:15:10.784 --> 00:15:12.786
[somber music playing]

00:15:17.583 --> 00:15:20.836
This was a long time ago,
long before this world.

00:15:21.503 --> 00:15:23.422
It really started to get to me.

00:15:23.505 --> 00:15:26.050
I got kind of hard and brittle inside.

00:15:26.759 --> 00:15:32.097
I mean, people feel as pleased to have
been born as if they did it themselves.

00:15:33.307 --> 00:15:39.396
But they get upset and hurt
and shaken when they die.

00:15:39.897 --> 00:15:44.401
But eventually,
I learned that all they really need

00:15:44.485 --> 00:15:48.197
is a kind word and a friendly face.

00:15:49.239 --> 00:15:50.824
Like they had in the beginning.

00:15:50.908 --> 00:15:52.868
-[woman] Hello.
-[baby fussing]

00:15:52.952 --> 00:15:55.079
Hello, baby girl.

00:15:55.579 --> 00:15:56.747
Are you hungry?

00:15:58.040 --> 00:15:59.917
Mum had better get your bottle, then.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.002
[baby continues fussing]

00:16:15.474 --> 00:16:19.186
Yeah. I'm afraid so.

00:16:20.479 --> 00:16:22.106
That's all there is, little one.

00:16:22.690 --> 00:16:23.941
That's all you get.

00:16:37.454 --> 00:16:39.873
[woman] All right, sweetie. Lunch time.

00:16:41.625 --> 00:16:42.501
We can go.

00:16:43.919 --> 00:16:45.796
[woman] We'll do some eating,

00:16:46.714 --> 00:16:49.133
then maybe another nap for Mummy's sake.

00:16:49.216 --> 00:16:51.885
Then maybe the park?

00:16:53.470 --> 00:16:54.346
Lovey?

00:16:55.014 --> 00:16:58.225
[Dream] I find myself
wondering about humanity.

00:16:58.308 --> 00:17:02.104
Their attitude towards your gift
is so strange.

00:17:05.399 --> 00:17:08.152
Why do they fear the Sunless Lands?

00:17:10.195 --> 00:17:12.990
It is as natural to die
as it is to be born.

00:17:17.286 --> 00:17:20.456
[Death] People may not
be ready for my gift.

00:17:21.957 --> 00:17:23.542
But they get it anyway.

00:17:24.626 --> 00:17:26.420
No matter what the circumstance.

00:17:58.118 --> 00:18:01.371
At the end, each of us stands alone.

00:18:03.165 --> 00:18:07.419
The Sunless Lands are far away
and the journey is hard.

00:18:09.713 --> 00:18:13.425
Most of us will be glad
for the company of a friend.

00:18:19.014 --> 00:18:21.100
It's funny looking back now.

00:18:22.059 --> 00:18:24.686
I used to think
I had to do this all by myself.

00:18:24.770 --> 00:18:26.563
[indistinct chatter]

00:18:26.647 --> 00:18:27.481
But you do.

00:18:29.817 --> 00:18:30.651
No.

00:18:32.653 --> 00:18:35.030
At the end, I'm there with them.

00:18:35.572 --> 00:18:38.700
I'm holding their hand
and they're holding mine.

00:18:39.618 --> 00:18:41.995
I'm not alone when I'm doing my job.

00:18:44.414 --> 00:18:45.499
And neither are you.

00:18:46.041 --> 00:18:47.167
Think about it.

00:18:48.502 --> 00:18:51.421
The only reason we even exist,

00:18:52.172 --> 00:18:56.343
you and I, and Desire and Despair,

00:18:57.553 --> 00:18:58.846
the whole family.

00:19:00.013 --> 00:19:02.516
We're here to serve them.

00:19:04.268 --> 00:19:10.649
It isn't about quests
or finding purpose outside our function.

00:19:12.234 --> 00:19:15.654
Our purpose is our function.

00:19:17.698 --> 00:19:19.158
We're here for them.

00:19:21.034 --> 00:19:22.786
Since I figured that out,

00:19:23.412 --> 00:19:29.501
I realized I need them
as much as they need me.

00:19:34.965 --> 00:19:39.845
I've seen so many cool things

00:19:39.928 --> 00:19:43.015
and people and worlds.

00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:45.475
I've learned so much.

00:19:48.395 --> 00:19:51.690
Lots of people don't have
a job they love doing, do they?

00:19:53.066 --> 00:19:56.486
So, I think I'm really very lucky.

00:19:58.488 --> 00:20:01.033
Listen, I've got to head back soon.

00:20:06.538 --> 00:20:08.957
You've taught me
something I had forgotten.

00:20:10.125 --> 00:20:11.627
I thank you, my sister.

00:20:15.005 --> 00:20:16.006
Aw.

00:20:17.507 --> 00:20:19.885
That's what family's about,
little brother.

00:20:19.968 --> 00:20:21.345
[Franklin] To me, man! Over here!

00:20:23.805 --> 00:20:26.725
-One last appointment, then I have to go.
-[tires screeching]

00:20:26.808 --> 00:20:28.894
-[thudding]
-I, too, am late for an appointment.

00:20:28.977 --> 00:20:29.937
[man shouting]

00:20:30.020 --> 00:20:31.313
Tell him I said hello.

00:20:31.396 --> 00:20:32.981
[indistinct chatter]

00:20:33.065 --> 00:20:34.107
[man] Franklin!

00:20:34.191 --> 00:20:35.108
I have to go.

00:20:38.987 --> 00:20:39.947
[Franklin] Hey.

00:20:40.030 --> 00:20:41.073
Did you see that?

00:20:41.782 --> 00:20:43.492
That car came this close to hitting me.

00:20:43.575 --> 00:20:45.118
This close, huh?

00:20:45.202 --> 00:20:46.036
Yeah.

00:20:46.662 --> 00:20:49.289
Come with me, Franklin.
I need to show you something.

00:20:50.499 --> 00:20:51.333
Okay.

00:20:51.833 --> 00:20:52.793
See ya, Dream.

00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:56.255
Don't be a stranger, okay?

00:21:05.138 --> 00:21:07.140
[intense music playing]

00:21:09.017 --> 00:21:11.019
[indistinct chatter]

00:21:24.032 --> 00:21:26.201
-[speaking indistinctly]
-Oi.

00:21:57.607 --> 00:21:58.442
Come on, then.

00:22:01.778 --> 00:22:03.196
What are you waiting for?

00:22:04.239 --> 00:22:05.198
Very well.

00:22:05.866 --> 00:22:08.577
But I do not see
what purpose this will serve.

00:22:08.660 --> 00:22:10.329
At least I get out and meet them.

00:22:12.122 --> 00:22:16.960
I just think maybe it would be good
for you to see them on their terms,

00:22:17.044 --> 00:22:18.128
instead of yours.

00:22:18.879 --> 00:22:22.466
Sir, penny ale for me and another
for my brother, if it please you.

00:22:22.549 --> 00:22:23.967
-Certainly, lady.
-[bleating]

00:22:24.551 --> 00:22:26.136
Ta. Here you go.

00:22:35.854 --> 00:22:36.688
Ugh.

00:22:37.439 --> 00:22:38.607
This is terrible.

00:22:38.690 --> 00:22:41.985
[man 1] His Majesty's third poll tax
in three years.

00:22:42.069 --> 00:22:43.987
What else could we have done, eh?

00:22:44.071 --> 00:22:46.156
[man 2] When Ball and Tyler were killed,

00:22:46.239 --> 00:22:48.283
the spirit of the working man
died with them.

00:22:50.369 --> 00:22:54.373
We've got war, plague,
and two bloody popes fighting.

00:22:54.956 --> 00:22:56.833
The end of the world is soon, you mark me.

00:22:56.917 --> 00:22:57.918
[man 3] Mmm-hmm.

00:22:58.001 --> 00:23:00.670
A delegation of Faerie
came to see me last night.

00:23:00.754 --> 00:23:03.340
They're talking about
abandoning this plane forever.

00:23:03.423 --> 00:23:06.134
Dream. Listen to the people.

00:23:07.511 --> 00:23:08.387
Drink your drink.

00:23:08.470 --> 00:23:10.639
[man 4] We need
to return to law and order.

00:23:10.722 --> 00:23:13.058
We need to act against these bandits.

00:23:13.141 --> 00:23:14.684
[man 5] Puttin' somethin' in the oven.

00:23:14.768 --> 00:23:16.728
So, he puts his hand up her dress.

00:23:16.812 --> 00:23:19.815
And she says, "Are you hunting
for rabbits again, Friar?"

00:23:19.898 --> 00:23:21.066
[all laughing]

00:23:23.902 --> 00:23:25.153
Piers Plowman.

00:23:25.237 --> 00:23:30.117
That's what people want, Geoffrey,
not filthy tales in rhyme about pilgrims.

00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:31.785
But Edmund, I enjoy rhyming.

00:23:32.494 --> 00:23:34.746
And I enjoy tavern tales
told of an evening.

00:23:34.830 --> 00:23:37.457
[man 6] Look, I've seen death.

00:23:38.834 --> 00:23:40.794
I lost half my village to the Black Death.

00:23:40.877 --> 00:23:42.462
I fought under Buckingham in Burgundy.

00:23:42.546 --> 00:23:45.841
It's not like I don't know what death is.
Death is…

00:23:47.968 --> 00:23:49.094
stupid.

00:23:49.177 --> 00:23:50.011
[men chuckle]

00:23:50.095 --> 00:23:51.221
[man 7] You're a fool, Hob.

00:23:51.805 --> 00:23:53.473
[Hob] Nobody has to die.

00:23:54.015 --> 00:23:57.269
The only reason people die
is… is 'cause everyone does it.

00:23:57.352 --> 00:23:59.563
You all just go along with it. But not me.

00:24:01.231 --> 00:24:02.441
I've made up my mind.

00:24:04.818 --> 00:24:05.986
I'm not going to die.

00:24:06.069 --> 00:24:07.487
[men laugh]

00:24:07.571 --> 00:24:09.448
[man 7] Hobs, death comes for every man.

00:24:09.531 --> 00:24:10.740
[Hob] You don't know that.

00:24:10.824 --> 00:24:12.784
I might get lucky.
There's always a first time.

00:24:12.868 --> 00:24:15.662
There's so much to do,
so many things to see.

00:24:16.246 --> 00:24:19.916
Women to swive. Ale to drink.
People to drink with.

00:24:22.711 --> 00:24:27.132
Why would any sensible creature
crave an eternity of this?

00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:30.051
You could find out.

00:24:30.135 --> 00:24:31.052
How?

00:24:31.136 --> 00:24:33.096
I could grant him his wish.

00:24:34.598 --> 00:24:39.311
Do that, and he will be begging for death
within a century, I assure you.

00:24:40.645 --> 00:24:42.063
This will prove very interesting.

00:24:42.147 --> 00:24:43.899
[man 7] What will you do
with all that life?

00:24:43.982 --> 00:24:46.401
[Hob] I'll find better friends than you,
I can tell you that.

00:24:47.027 --> 00:24:48.862
Are you gonna tell him, or should I?

00:24:50.405 --> 00:24:51.281
I shall.

00:24:52.407 --> 00:24:53.742
Very well, little brother.

00:24:56.077 --> 00:24:57.078
Very well.

00:24:57.162 --> 00:24:59.164
[indistinct chatter]

00:25:04.544 --> 00:25:07.839
Did I hear you say
you have no intention of ever dying?

00:25:09.257 --> 00:25:10.592
[chuckles]

00:25:10.675 --> 00:25:12.093
Uh, yeah. Yeah, that's right.

00:25:12.177 --> 00:25:14.054
Then you must tell me what it's like.

00:25:14.137 --> 00:25:15.222
[Hob chuckles]

00:25:15.305 --> 00:25:18.767
Let us meet here again, Robert Gadling,

00:25:19.518 --> 00:25:23.313
in this tavern of the White Horse
in 100 years.

00:25:23.396 --> 00:25:25.023
[men laughing]

00:25:27.567 --> 00:25:29.736
[man 7] A hundred years
and I'm Pope Urban.

00:25:31.655 --> 00:25:32.781
Don't mind them.

00:25:34.366 --> 00:25:37.452
A hundred years' time, on this day?

00:25:40.413 --> 00:25:43.792
I will see you
in the year of our Lord 1489, then.

00:25:56.805 --> 00:25:58.014
Who was that, then, Hobsie?

00:25:58.098 --> 00:25:59.182
Haven't a clue.

00:26:00.350 --> 00:26:02.852
But tell you what,
I'll ask him in 100 years' time.

00:26:03.353 --> 00:26:04.688
[men guffaw]

00:26:16.950 --> 00:26:20.912
[Hob] How did you know…
that I'd still be here?

00:26:23.623 --> 00:26:24.666
Who are you?

00:26:26.543 --> 00:26:28.920
A wizard? A… a saint?

00:26:33.133 --> 00:26:34.009
A demon?

00:26:36.386 --> 00:26:38.179
Have I made a bargain with the devil?

00:26:38.263 --> 00:26:39.264
No.

00:26:39.848 --> 00:26:42.892
Then why aren't I dead long since?

00:26:43.852 --> 00:26:45.562
Is this some kind of game?

00:26:46.146 --> 00:26:47.063
No game.

00:26:47.689 --> 00:26:49.190
But why?

00:26:53.111 --> 00:26:54.112
Who are you?

00:26:55.822 --> 00:26:57.282
Why are you here?

00:26:59.159 --> 00:27:01.119
I'm here because I'm interested.

00:27:02.495 --> 00:27:03.330
In me?

00:27:03.913 --> 00:27:05.290
In your experience.

00:27:07.417 --> 00:27:09.419
-What do I have to do?
-Nothing.

00:27:10.003 --> 00:27:11.463
You live your life as you choose.

00:27:11.546 --> 00:27:14.674
Then on this day,
every 100 years, we will meet.

00:27:16.343 --> 00:27:18.261
Because you wanna know what it's like.

00:27:23.725 --> 00:27:27.103
All right. I'll tell you what it's like.

00:27:32.651 --> 00:27:34.235
[sighs] It's fucking brilliant.

00:27:37.364 --> 00:27:38.531
It's all changing.

00:27:38.615 --> 00:27:39.741
In what way?

00:27:39.824 --> 00:27:40.659
Um…

00:27:41.326 --> 00:27:42.619
Chimneys.

00:27:42.702 --> 00:27:45.997
Not having your eyes watering
all the time from the smoke. [chuckles]

00:27:46.706 --> 00:27:50.168
And now we have
these little cloth pieces for your nose.

00:27:50.251 --> 00:27:52.212
In the old days, we just used our sleeves.

00:27:52.295 --> 00:27:53.296
[man grunts]

00:27:53.380 --> 00:27:55.173
Oh. And playing cards.

00:27:55.715 --> 00:27:58.551
What will you people think of next?

00:27:59.344 --> 00:28:01.554
With any luck,
something to get rid of fleas.

00:28:01.638 --> 00:28:04.557
But what have you been doing
for the last hundred years?

00:28:04.641 --> 00:28:05.517
Um…

00:28:07.102 --> 00:28:09.688
Same as before. Soldiering, mainly.

00:28:09.771 --> 00:28:12.273
A little banditry here and there
if I couldn't find a war.

00:28:12.357 --> 00:28:15.527
Uh, but now, I've started in a new trade.

00:28:16.653 --> 00:28:17.737
It's called printing.

00:28:18.321 --> 00:28:19.989
Don't need to be a guild member, not yet.

00:28:20.073 --> 00:28:23.535
Uh, never be a real demand for it,
and it's hard work,

00:28:24.828 --> 00:28:27.914
but it beats the hell out of
rotting to maggots in the ground, eh?

00:28:30.625 --> 00:28:33.086
So you still want to live?

00:28:33.712 --> 00:28:34.546
Oh, yes.

00:28:38.383 --> 00:28:39.509
A hundred years, then?

00:28:40.468 --> 00:28:41.302
Oh, yes.

00:28:44.431 --> 00:28:45.932
You never told me who you are.

00:28:55.692 --> 00:29:02.240
Well, Kit, your theme as I saw it is this:
that for one's art and for one's dreams,

00:29:02.907 --> 00:29:05.910
one may consort and bargain
with the darkest powers.

00:29:05.994 --> 00:29:06.953
'Tis so.

00:29:07.036 --> 00:29:07.954
My friend!

00:29:08.663 --> 00:29:09.497
[grunts]

00:29:10.039 --> 00:29:10.874
Sit down.

00:29:11.791 --> 00:29:15.003
Got in a couple of bottles
of good wine for us.

00:29:15.086 --> 00:29:16.671
Already made a start on 'em.

00:29:16.755 --> 00:29:17.672
Hello, Hob.

00:29:18.673 --> 00:29:19.507
"Hob"?

00:29:19.591 --> 00:29:22.469
Faith, that takes me back some few years.

00:29:22.552 --> 00:29:25.889
It's Sir Robert Gadlen now, old stranger.

00:29:25.972 --> 00:29:27.807
You've had good fortune, I take it.

00:29:27.891 --> 00:29:31.060
The gods have smiled on me
as they smile on all England

00:29:31.144 --> 00:29:33.313
where no man is slave or bondsman.

00:29:33.855 --> 00:29:34.773
Venison pasty?

00:29:36.107 --> 00:29:37.859
No? They're good.

00:29:39.569 --> 00:29:40.403
Mmm.

00:29:41.029 --> 00:29:42.155
Let's see.

00:29:42.238 --> 00:29:44.741
Last we spoke,
I was working with Billy Caxton.

00:29:44.824 --> 00:29:48.203
Made some gold from that.
Put it to work in Henry Tudor's shipyards.

00:29:48.286 --> 00:29:49.162
I made a small pile.

00:29:49.245 --> 00:29:52.248
Then I went north for a year or so,
came back as my son.

00:29:52.332 --> 00:29:53.374
Done that twice now.

00:29:54.375 --> 00:29:55.376
Girl, more wine.

00:29:56.044 --> 00:29:59.047
When fat Henry had gone
for the monasteries, I bought my estates,

00:29:59.130 --> 00:30:02.425
and a healthy gift of gold
to the Crown saw to…

00:30:03.635 --> 00:30:04.803
a knighthood.

00:30:05.345 --> 00:30:06.554
[laughs]

00:30:07.806 --> 00:30:09.057
That's not all. Here.

00:30:12.894 --> 00:30:16.105
My fair Eleanor and little Robyn.

00:30:17.357 --> 00:30:21.653
My first son born in over 200 years
on this Earth, that I know of.

00:30:23.863 --> 00:30:24.823
It's funny.

00:30:25.907 --> 00:30:30.870
This is what I always dreamed
Heaven would be like, way back.

00:30:32.330 --> 00:30:36.501
It's safe to walk the streets.
Enough food. Good wine.

00:30:36.584 --> 00:30:39.087
Life is so rich.

00:30:40.129 --> 00:30:43.383
[man 1] God's wounds!
If only I could write like you.

00:30:43.466 --> 00:30:49.097
In… in Faustus, when you wrote,
"To God? He loves thee not."

00:30:49.180 --> 00:30:50.348
Will, sit down.

00:30:50.431 --> 00:30:54.060
"The God thou servest
is thine own appetite,

00:30:54.143 --> 00:30:57.856
wherein is fixed the love of Beelzebub."

00:30:57.939 --> 00:31:00.817
"To him, I'll build an altar in the church

00:31:00.900 --> 00:31:04.612
and offer up lukewarm blood
of new-born babes."

00:31:04.696 --> 00:31:05.697
[men] Hear, hear!

00:31:05.780 --> 00:31:07.365
-[banging on tables]
-[applause]

00:31:10.535 --> 00:31:12.662
[Will] I would give anything
to have your gifts.

00:31:12.745 --> 00:31:16.583
To give men dreams
that would live on long after I'm dead.

00:31:16.666 --> 00:31:20.920
I would bargain
like your Faustus for that boon.

00:31:21.963 --> 00:31:23.047
Who is he?

00:31:23.131 --> 00:31:26.968
His name's Will Shaxberd. [burps]
Acts a bit. Wrote a play.

00:31:27.051 --> 00:31:27.886
Is he good?

00:31:28.678 --> 00:31:29.762
No, he's crap.

00:31:30.305 --> 00:31:33.057
Now, that chap next to him,
with the broken leg,

00:31:33.141 --> 00:31:35.018
he is a good playwright.

00:31:37.312 --> 00:31:40.857
Anyway, I've saved the best bit for last.

00:31:41.441 --> 00:31:44.652
The queen herself slept
at my house this summer.

00:31:45.653 --> 00:31:47.280
That was expensive.

00:32:01.252 --> 00:32:02.670
Are you Will Shaxberd?

00:32:03.338 --> 00:32:06.466
Uh, aye, sir. Have we met?

00:32:07.884 --> 00:32:11.220
We have. But men forget in waking hours.

00:32:11.804 --> 00:32:13.181
I heard you talk, Will.

00:32:14.098 --> 00:32:15.600
Would you write great plays?

00:32:16.726 --> 00:32:19.729
Create new dreams
to spur the minds of men?

00:32:21.314 --> 00:32:22.482
Is that your will?

00:32:26.235 --> 00:32:27.403
[chuckles softly]

00:32:29.364 --> 00:32:30.490
It is.

00:32:30.573 --> 00:32:31.866
Then let us talk.

00:32:39.874 --> 00:32:42.293
Sir, do you still want the lamb, sir?

00:32:48.967 --> 00:32:51.427
Aye. Bring on the lamb.

00:32:52.220 --> 00:32:53.596
Everything to live for.

00:32:55.014 --> 00:32:56.516
And nowhere to go but up.

00:33:00.019 --> 00:33:02.939
[man 1] Do not be so free
in assigning plagues, fires, floods

00:33:03.022 --> 00:33:05.775
to the judgment of the Lord for our sins.

00:33:06.859 --> 00:33:09.988
They make more from the dole
than they would from an honest day's work.

00:33:10.071 --> 00:33:11.698
[man 2] I don't recommend that at all.

00:33:12.407 --> 00:33:14.200
[waitress] You sure I can't help you, sir?

00:33:14.951 --> 00:33:16.327
No, thank you. I'm waiting for…

00:33:16.411 --> 00:33:19.414
[Hob] Don't touch me!
Fucking dungwit. Get out of my way!

00:33:19.497 --> 00:33:22.166
Get back to the stews
with the rest of the filth.

00:33:22.250 --> 00:33:25.670
Let him be. He is my guest.

00:33:32.510 --> 00:33:33.803
I knew you'd be here.

00:33:38.808 --> 00:33:41.894
Do you know how hungry a man can get?

00:33:43.855 --> 00:33:46.065
If he doesn't die but he doesn't eat?

00:33:51.946 --> 00:33:53.114
I lost it all.

00:33:54.198 --> 00:33:56.743
My land. My gold.

00:33:59.078 --> 00:34:00.079
My Eleanor.

00:34:02.790 --> 00:34:04.417
She died in childbirth.

00:34:05.543 --> 00:34:06.919
The baby too.

00:34:07.879 --> 00:34:12.508
My boy, Robyn,
died in a tavern brawl when he was 20.

00:34:12.592 --> 00:34:14.510
I didn't go out much
after that. [sniffles]

00:34:17.346 --> 00:34:19.140
They tried to drown me as a witch.

00:34:19.682 --> 00:34:22.185
I'd lived there 40 years, overconfident.

00:34:22.268 --> 00:34:24.604
I got out with my skin a little more.

00:34:25.938 --> 00:34:27.315
And then it got worse.

00:34:28.816 --> 00:34:32.320
And worse and… worse.

00:34:36.282 --> 00:34:42.288
I've hated every second
of the last 80 years, every bloody second.

00:34:42.371 --> 00:34:43.206
You know that?

00:34:45.500 --> 00:34:47.210
So do you still wish to live?

00:34:53.591 --> 00:34:55.051
Are you crazy?

00:34:56.803 --> 00:35:00.348
Death is a mug's game.
I got so much to live for.

00:35:06.562 --> 00:35:09.148
Now can we order?
'Cause I'm about to eat the fucking table.

00:35:32.964 --> 00:35:34.966
[Hob] I heard something funny
the other week.

00:35:35.049 --> 00:35:36.676
Bloke said to me, he said,

00:35:36.759 --> 00:35:39.387
"If only the French nobles had
played cricket with their men

00:35:39.470 --> 00:35:42.140
the way we do,
they'd never have had this trouble."

00:35:42.223 --> 00:35:44.308
[pleasant music playing]

00:35:44.392 --> 00:35:46.727
You know, first the colonies, now France.

00:35:47.687 --> 00:35:50.398
You ask me, this country
will be next for a revolution.

00:35:51.315 --> 00:35:53.693
I've been salting money away
all over the world.

00:35:54.360 --> 00:35:56.737
First sign of trouble,
I'll be out of here like that.

00:35:59.323 --> 00:36:00.533
In the meantime…

00:36:03.286 --> 00:36:04.745
I'm in the shipping business.

00:36:06.455 --> 00:36:10.793
There's a new system where
they take English cotton goods to Africa,

00:36:11.711 --> 00:36:14.213
get a cargo of negroes,
pack 'em in like sardines.

00:36:14.297 --> 00:36:16.841
Same ship takes them across the Atlantic.

00:36:16.924 --> 00:36:19.969
Then comes back here
with raw cotton, tobacco and sugar.

00:36:23.055 --> 00:36:23.973
What?

00:36:25.224 --> 00:36:27.768
It's a poor thing
for one man to enslave another.

00:36:29.187 --> 00:36:30.396
It's just how it's done.

00:36:30.479 --> 00:36:33.900
I suggest you find yourself a different
line of business, Robert Gadling.

00:36:35.276 --> 00:36:36.611
You're giving me advice?

00:36:37.945 --> 00:36:39.822
After 400 years?

00:36:39.906 --> 00:36:41.991
What happened to
"live your life as you choose"?

00:36:42.074 --> 00:36:44.952
The choice is yours.

00:36:45.536 --> 00:36:47.830
But would you take
that choice away from others?

00:36:55.880 --> 00:36:57.506
I will consider your advice.

00:37:03.346 --> 00:37:06.015
I saw a production of King Lear yesterday.

00:37:06.098 --> 00:37:09.477
Mrs. Siddons as Goneril.
The idiots had given it a happy ending.

00:37:10.394 --> 00:37:11.604
That will not last.

00:37:11.687 --> 00:37:14.857
The great stories will always
return to their original forms.

00:37:17.860 --> 00:37:21.155
That lad, Will Shakespeare.

00:37:22.573 --> 00:37:25.326
He turned out to be
a half-decent playwright after all.

00:37:28.371 --> 00:37:30.331
You made some kind of deal with him,
didn't you?

00:37:30.414 --> 00:37:31.249
Perhaps.

00:37:31.332 --> 00:37:33.459
What kind of deal? His soul?

00:37:33.542 --> 00:37:35.378
Nothing so crude.

00:37:35.461 --> 00:37:36.295
[chuckles]

00:37:37.797 --> 00:37:40.508
Four hundred years now,
I've been meeting you here

00:37:40.591 --> 00:37:43.886
and there is so much I still don't know.

00:37:43.970 --> 00:37:45.972
Who are you? Truly?

00:37:46.555 --> 00:37:47.556
What's your name?

00:37:51.143 --> 00:37:55.106
I might ask both of you
that same question, gentlemen.

00:37:55.189 --> 00:37:59.110
Please, please,
do not trouble yourselves to rise.

00:37:59.193 --> 00:38:00.820
These are Michael and Tobias.

00:38:01.362 --> 00:38:02.446
Smugglers by trade.

00:38:02.530 --> 00:38:06.492
Although, they're only too glad to augment
their earnings by slitting throats.

00:38:06.575 --> 00:38:08.661
If you move, they'll slit yours.

00:38:09.287 --> 00:38:11.956
They tell of a tale in these London parts,

00:38:12.498 --> 00:38:17.378
that the Devil and the Wandering Jew
meet once every century in a tavern.

00:38:18.462 --> 00:38:21.257
Two years past,
sewn into the shirt of a dead man,

00:38:21.340 --> 00:38:23.968
I found this.

00:38:25.386 --> 00:38:26.554
Is that meant to be me?

00:38:27.138 --> 00:38:29.682
Oh, I look terrible. You look worse.

00:38:29.765 --> 00:38:32.268
You return to this pub every 100 years,

00:38:32.893 --> 00:38:37.315
striking bargains with men,
sharing gifts, immortality,

00:38:38.733 --> 00:38:40.067
which you will now share with me.

00:38:43.112 --> 00:38:46.490
Well, have you nothing to say?

00:38:46.574 --> 00:38:48.159
I am no Devil.

00:38:48.242 --> 00:38:49.702
And I'm not Jewish.

00:38:50.286 --> 00:38:51.120
Fie.

00:38:53.080 --> 00:38:54.874
What manner of creatures are you then?

00:38:54.957 --> 00:38:56.208
Who wants to know?

00:38:56.292 --> 00:38:58.294
I'm Lady Johanna Constantine.

00:38:59.086 --> 00:39:01.630
You will both follow me, sirs.
My coach is without.

00:39:03.257 --> 00:39:05.509
I can see there is
so much you can tell me.

00:39:07.053 --> 00:39:08.220
So much I can learn.

00:39:10.097 --> 00:39:11.140
No.

00:39:13.184 --> 00:39:14.643
No, I think not.

00:39:22.568 --> 00:39:23.694
[Tobias] Get up.

00:39:24.653 --> 00:39:25.529
[groans]

00:39:25.613 --> 00:39:26.864
[grunting]

00:39:32.370 --> 00:39:33.621
[panting]

00:39:35.998 --> 00:39:36.874
[Dream] Wait.

00:39:46.842 --> 00:39:47.718
[knife clatters]

00:39:47.802 --> 00:39:49.428
[Lady Johanna breathing heavily]

00:39:50.596 --> 00:39:52.264
[whispers] No.

00:39:53.724 --> 00:39:55.017
No, not you.

00:39:56.936 --> 00:39:58.020
I'm sorry.
