WEBVTT

00:00:14.598 --> 00:00:16.099
Fuck. Hang on.

00:00:17.643 --> 00:00:18.727
Fuck it's--

00:00:19.311 --> 00:00:20.604
Shit. Give me your hand.

00:00:22.648 --> 00:00:25.984
- It's higher than it looks. Be careful.
- It's not that high.

00:00:26.068 --> 00:00:27.069
Just be careful.

00:00:27.152 --> 00:00:28.946
All right, Min. It's fine.
It's not that hard.

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:31.573
It's just higher than it looks.
Ready?

00:00:33.408 --> 00:00:35.160
Hands off, Min.

00:00:36.703 --> 00:00:37.788
Shit.

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:41.959
For fuck's sake.

00:00:42.584 --> 00:00:44.002
What are you moaning about now?

00:00:44.086 --> 00:00:45.462
Fucking ripped my coat.

00:00:46.213 --> 00:00:48.048
I've ripped my coat completely.

00:00:49.424 --> 00:00:51.969
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine. Why? You see anyone?

00:00:52.052 --> 00:00:53.720
- No, can you?
- No.

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:07.526
Taverner's voice mail.

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:09.736
In the car you said you'd tell me.

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:11.864
So, what did she mean
about Charles's death?

00:01:12.447 --> 00:01:15.534
Read the room, will you?
Is now really the time?

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:27.254
It's Lamb.

00:01:29.381 --> 00:01:30.716
"Minuisa."

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:34.261
You've got a key?

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:36.471
Where the fuck is Struan?

00:01:36.555 --> 00:01:38.473
I told you to get Struan.

00:01:38.557 --> 00:01:40.392
The Dogs got to him just before us.

00:01:40.475 --> 00:01:41.810
- Did they see you?
- Yo.

00:01:43.896 --> 00:01:45.314
Cartwright?

00:01:45.397 --> 00:01:47.316
Went to try and wake Sleeping Beauty.

00:01:48.567 --> 00:01:51.653
Sid. She's in a coma and is a beauty.

00:01:52.696 --> 00:01:54.031
Or was, till she got shot in the head.

00:01:54.114 --> 00:01:55.115
Oh, Jesus, Ho.

00:01:55.199 --> 00:01:57.034
Dog rolled up, so I split.

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:58.911
We gotta go.

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.497
Taverner will pick us off one by one.

00:02:02.581 --> 00:02:03.999
Find someone to turn.

00:02:04.082 --> 00:02:05.918
She and Black had a plan.

00:02:06.001 --> 00:02:10.047
Now that's gone to shit, she'll try
and play it as Slough House gone rogue.

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.966
And what about the boy?
What happens to Hassan?

00:02:13.926 --> 00:02:16.303
If he's not dead already,
he soon will be.

00:02:21.058 --> 00:02:22.893
You're a fucking dickhead, Roddy.

00:02:25.187 --> 00:02:26.647
I remember where I saw Alan Black.

00:02:28.315 --> 00:02:29.733
He was meeting with Taverner.

00:02:31.902 --> 00:02:34.821
All right, go back.
What were they doing?

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:38.367
Talking at her gym café.

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:40.577
It came back to me when I saw Sid

00:02:40.661 --> 00:02:43.288
because she took the piss out of me
for following Taverner.

00:02:44.122 --> 00:02:46.041
They were meeting secretly.

00:02:46.124 --> 00:02:48.377
But it's your word against hers.

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:50.629
Yes, but I was following her
for surveillance training.

00:02:52.214 --> 00:02:53.715
So I took a photograph.

00:02:56.134 --> 00:02:57.594
Well, do you have it?

00:02:58.136 --> 00:02:59.471
No, not yet.

00:02:59.555 --> 00:03:01.640
But I think I know
where there might be a copy.

00:03:01.723 --> 00:03:02.850
A copy?

00:03:02.933 --> 00:03:03.892
This is hopeless.

00:03:04.393 --> 00:03:06.728
Well, it would certainly seem that way.

00:03:11.608 --> 00:03:12.609
Look.

00:03:13.402 --> 00:03:15.696
I don't normally do these
kind of speeches,

00:03:15.779 --> 00:03:17.406
but this feels like a big moment,

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:21.159
and if it all turns to shit,
I might not see any of you again.

00:03:25.664 --> 00:03:28.250
You're fucking useless. The lot of you.

00:03:28.917 --> 00:03:32.421
Working with you has been the lowest
point in a disappointing career.

00:03:34.464 --> 00:03:35.465
Right.

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:37.176
Cartwright, you're with me.

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:42.055
But wait, what do we do?

00:03:42.139 --> 00:03:44.433
Well, try not to get caught
for as long as you can.

00:03:44.516 --> 00:03:45.976
My money's on about 30 minutes.

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:47.853
Well, we can try and save Hassan.

00:03:48.812 --> 00:03:51.023
That'd be a sure way
to get him killed.

00:03:51.106 --> 00:03:54.693
Go lock yourselves in a toilet somewhere.

00:03:57.237 --> 00:03:58.447
What a wanker.

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:01.867
- Where are we going?
- To go and get that photo, you dickhead.

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:03.869
Back there, that's you
goading them into action, right?

00:04:03.952 --> 00:04:06.205
Fuck no. I meant every word.

00:04:06.288 --> 00:04:08.332
Right. Just checking.

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:14.713
Fucking Christ.

00:05:04.638 --> 00:05:06.890
<i>Police are still frantically searching</i>

00:05:06.974 --> 00:05:09.268
<i>for the whereabouts
of the hostage Hassan Ahmed,</i>

00:05:09.351 --> 00:05:11.895
<i>whose kidnappers have threatened
to behead him</i>

00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:14.398
<i>at sunrise this morning around 6:30--</i>

00:05:14.481 --> 00:05:15.440
You hear that?

00:05:15.524 --> 00:05:18.902
So they're still expecting us
to do that thing that we're not--

00:05:18.986 --> 00:05:20.070
we're not fucking doing.

00:05:20.153 --> 00:05:21.822
Nothing about the dead spook.

00:05:22.364 --> 00:05:24.074
Maybe they haven't found the body yet.

00:05:24.157 --> 00:05:26.159
They'll have found the body.
With you two screaming

00:05:26.243 --> 00:05:28.954
like a pair of little girls,
someone will have called it in.

00:05:30.414 --> 00:05:32.291
You know why it's not on the news, right?

00:05:33.292 --> 00:05:35.878
They wanna bury it. And us.

00:05:35.961 --> 00:05:39.840
An MI5 agent involved in a kidnap plot.
They don't want people talking about that.

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:43.302
Nah. We are gonna die
resisting arrest, boys.

00:05:43.385 --> 00:05:46.805
So the way I see it is we may as well
have some fun first.

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:49.391
Chop-chop.

00:05:50.225 --> 00:05:51.226
Fucking hell.

00:05:53.437 --> 00:05:55.355
- So what?
- Just said that.

00:05:55.939 --> 00:05:56.940
So what?

00:05:59.234 --> 00:06:00.861
See any lights?

00:06:00.944 --> 00:06:04.281
- Second floor, maybe.
- Did you leave them on?

00:06:05.199 --> 00:06:06.200
I don't remember.

00:06:06.283 --> 00:06:07.826
- Well, think.
- I don't know.

00:06:08.535 --> 00:06:10.037
You were there too. Why didn't you check?

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:12.331
Because I've earned the right not to.

00:06:27.638 --> 00:06:29.306
Well, it looks clear.

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:32.976
Doesn't mean to say the place
isn't swarming with Dogs.

00:06:34.019 --> 00:06:36.021
Or a clean-up team for the body or a trap?

00:06:37.314 --> 00:06:38.857
Well, you better go in and find out.

00:06:42.361 --> 00:06:43.737
I'm going in alone, am I?

00:06:44.363 --> 00:06:46.573
Every man for me, Cartwright.

00:06:46.657 --> 00:06:47.783
Don't worry.

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:50.577
I'll be here,
guarding the breach and all.

00:06:51.828 --> 00:06:52.913
Thanks.

00:06:58.669 --> 00:07:01.004
<i>What is the latest
we know about Hassan Ahmed?</i>

00:07:01.088 --> 00:07:03.799
<i>Well, time really is of the essence now.</i>

00:07:03.882 --> 00:07:06.677
<i>But we've had no further updates
from either the Metropolitan Police</i>

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:08.720
- <i>or the security services…</i>
- That poor boy.

00:07:08.804 --> 00:07:10.514
- <i>…with regards to the release…</i>
- How can you eat?

00:07:10.597 --> 00:07:11.598
<i>…of Hassan Ahmed.</i>

00:07:12.099 --> 00:07:14.476
Relax. Dogs are nowhere near.

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:15.936
You hacked the Dogs' comms?

00:07:16.019 --> 00:07:18.230
Snuck into their kennel,
muzzled them bitches,

00:07:18.313 --> 00:07:20.357
- stole their bones.
- That's so wrong.

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:23.861
Whatever. They're outside our homes
and waiting for us.

00:07:25.779 --> 00:07:29.241
Waiting for us to use our phones
and credit cards or passports.

00:07:29.324 --> 00:07:31.368
So, we just hole up in here
for the rest of our lives, do we?

00:07:31.451 --> 00:07:32.536
Right. We're fucked then.

00:07:32.619 --> 00:07:33.787
Can't track me.

00:07:33.871 --> 00:07:35.664
I'm a digital ghost, so I'm fine.

00:07:35.747 --> 00:07:37.165
Thanks for the team spirit, Ho.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:39.543
You're forgetting Lamb.

00:07:39.626 --> 00:07:41.128
Lamb doesn't care about us.

00:07:41.211 --> 00:07:43.922
As soon as whatever he's got planned
goes south, he's gonna forget us.

00:07:44.006 --> 00:07:44.923
That's not true.

00:07:45.007 --> 00:07:47.718
The thing Charles always said
about Lamb--

00:07:48.635 --> 00:07:49.678
Charles?

00:07:51.972 --> 00:07:54.558
You hurt his joes,
he'll never stop coming for you.

00:07:54.641 --> 00:07:58.270
And the thing, for Lamb, there's nothing
worse than not being able to get even.

00:07:58.353 --> 00:07:59.938
And he's not gonna wanna lose to Taverner.

00:08:00.022 --> 00:08:01.773
- Exactly.
- I think he's got even more contempt

00:08:01.857 --> 00:08:03.192
for her than he does for us.

00:08:03.275 --> 00:08:05.152
Wow, that's a skip-load of contempt.

00:08:05.235 --> 00:08:06.403
And meanwhile, we what?

00:08:06.486 --> 00:08:08.655
<i>Can we talk about
the ethics of this for a moment?</i>

00:08:08.739 --> 00:08:13.035
<i>Because if they are going to behead
Hassan at 6:30 a.m.,</i>

00:08:13.118 --> 00:08:16.121
<i>as they say they are,
are people really going to watch?</i>

00:08:16.205 --> 00:08:18.081
<i>And if they do, are they not complicit?</i>

00:08:18.165 --> 00:08:20.209
Roddy, where are the Park on Hassan?

00:08:21.126 --> 00:08:23.921
They've just narrowed it down
to ten vehicles that have left the area.

00:08:24.004 --> 00:08:27.549
The one thing that we can bring to this
is that we knew Alan Black,

00:08:27.633 --> 00:08:28.634
so,

00:08:29.510 --> 00:08:31.345
what do we remember about him?

00:08:31.428 --> 00:08:32.971
He was sent to Slough House

00:08:33.054 --> 00:08:35.682
for sleeping with the Venezuelan
ambassador's wife while undercover.

00:08:35.765 --> 00:08:37.518
Apart from that.

00:08:37.601 --> 00:08:39.727
He moaned a lot. Never bought biscuits.

00:08:39.811 --> 00:08:41.730
- Oh, my God.
- Sorry, what? We're free-forming.

00:08:41.813 --> 00:08:43.732
- There's no bad ideas here.
- He was really lazy.

00:08:43.815 --> 00:08:45.609
And that's better than what I said, is it?

00:08:45.692 --> 00:08:47.653
Listen, he was undercover
with the Sons of Albion,

00:08:47.736 --> 00:08:49.363
so there would have been
a birth certificate,

00:08:49.446 --> 00:08:52.324
passport, credit cards, the full legend.

00:08:52.866 --> 00:08:54.284
Yeah. Deep cover's expensive.

00:08:54.368 --> 00:08:57.746
He was tight, so he definitely
wouldn't want to have to front that.

00:08:57.829 --> 00:09:00.457
More than that. Taverner won't want
any of it to show up on the books.

00:09:00.541 --> 00:09:02.960
So he could have used an old ID.

00:09:03.710 --> 00:09:04.711
Roddy?

00:09:06.171 --> 00:09:07.923
If you'll give me a few minutes, ladies.

00:09:08.006 --> 00:09:09.049
And gentleman.

00:09:10.801 --> 00:09:11.885
Ladies.

00:09:53.844 --> 00:09:56.013
And that's another "Ho-me" run.

00:09:57.055 --> 00:09:58.891
Meet Dermot Radcliffe.

00:09:58.974 --> 00:10:01.143
AKA Alan Black.

00:10:01.226 --> 00:10:02.519
Legend for a football hooligan.

00:10:02.603 --> 00:10:03.896
Ex-forces too.

00:10:03.979 --> 00:10:05.898
That's catnip for British nationalists.

00:10:05.981 --> 00:10:08.150
Let's see what Dermot's
been up to recently.

00:10:26.126 --> 00:10:28.253
Sorry, Jed. Lamb's idea.

00:10:37.804 --> 00:10:39.681
- Lamb and Standish--
- Have not been apprehended.

00:10:39.765 --> 00:10:41.767
- Yes, I can see that.
- Lamb pulled a gun.

00:10:41.850 --> 00:10:43.310
You didn't frisk him?

00:10:43.393 --> 00:10:44.520
It was in Standish's bag.

00:10:46.688 --> 00:10:48.023
This is them?

00:10:48.106 --> 00:10:50.275
Fingerprints match those
at the Roupell Street house.

00:10:50.359 --> 00:10:52.945
They all have priors. ABH, GBH, burglary.

00:10:53.028 --> 00:10:55.489
- How we doing on the vehicles?
- Still have eight to locate,

00:10:55.572 --> 00:10:57.699
but they might be avoiding roads
with CCTV.

00:10:57.783 --> 00:10:59.034
They may have swapped vehicles.

00:10:59.117 --> 00:11:01.203
We're following up
on all reported vehicle thefts.

00:11:01.286 --> 00:11:02.496
- Ma'am.
- Not now.

00:11:05.749 --> 00:11:06.834
Showtime.

00:11:07.709 --> 00:11:09.169
We're running out of petrol.

00:11:09.670 --> 00:11:10.671
No.

00:11:11.672 --> 00:11:13.090
Fuck off!

00:11:13.173 --> 00:11:15.050
So what? Stop at the garage.

00:11:15.133 --> 00:11:17.553
- We're covered in fucking blood.
- Bit of a giveaway.

00:11:17.636 --> 00:11:19.012
We'll end up on the CCTV.

00:11:19.096 --> 00:11:20.681
Shouldn't have left
the balaclavas behind.

00:11:20.764 --> 00:11:22.182
Well, we can't make the boat

00:11:22.266 --> 00:11:24.184
- without petrol, can we?
- Just calm down. I've got a plan.

00:11:24.268 --> 00:11:27.229
- Yeah?
- We drive until we run out,

00:11:27.312 --> 00:11:28.689
and then we're gonna chop his head off.

00:11:29.273 --> 00:11:31.233
What the fuck is wrong with you?

00:11:31.316 --> 00:11:33.151
- Yeah, let's just think about this.
- We don't have options.

00:11:33.235 --> 00:11:35.779
Yeah, we do.
We have the option not to fucking do that.

00:11:35.863 --> 00:11:37.531
And have all this for nothing?

00:11:37.614 --> 00:11:40.033
While they set us up and make us
look like twats and we don't even do

00:11:40.117 --> 00:11:42.369
the thing that we said we were gonna do.

00:11:42.452 --> 00:11:44.663
No, I can't have that.

00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:46.999
We'll be a fucking joke.

00:11:47.082 --> 00:11:48.917
People need to fear and respect us.

00:11:49.001 --> 00:11:52.129
They need to know that we mean
what we say when we say it.

00:11:53.130 --> 00:11:55.883
Enough is enough, man.
This is our country, and we want it--

00:11:55.966 --> 00:11:57.176
Fucking shut up!

00:11:59.553 --> 00:12:01.388
I've had enough. Okay?

00:12:02.055 --> 00:12:05.017
- Where'd you get that?
- On the guy whose head he cut off, eh?

00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:07.769
He said he was a spy,
but you didn't check his pockets, did ya?

00:12:07.853 --> 00:12:09.229
And I'm the dumb one, aren't I?

00:12:09.313 --> 00:12:12.232
You'd rather spill my British blood
than his, then you're a traitor.

00:12:12.316 --> 00:12:13.525
Yeah.

00:12:14.651 --> 00:12:16.737
Get in the back. Check he's okay.

00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:18.238
You're a fucking embarrassment, man.

00:12:18.322 --> 00:12:20.032
I think he's being sick.

00:12:20.115 --> 00:12:22.159
Yep. He's choking on his sick.

00:12:22.242 --> 00:12:24.036
- Result.
- Hey.

00:12:24.119 --> 00:12:26.455
Pull over. Chop-chop.

00:12:38.050 --> 00:12:39.051
Get out.

00:12:40.177 --> 00:12:41.178
Go on.

00:12:41.929 --> 00:12:43.347
I said get out, now.

00:12:44.056 --> 00:12:45.682
Come on. Move it.

00:12:48.685 --> 00:12:51.188
Just move it. Open the door.

00:12:52.814 --> 00:12:54.316
Right. Lift him up.

00:12:55.067 --> 00:12:58.153
And get that fucking tape off his face.

00:12:59.321 --> 00:13:00.906
Fuck.

00:13:00.989 --> 00:13:01.990
Okay.

00:13:04.576 --> 00:13:06.286
Put something in his mouth.

00:13:06.370 --> 00:13:07.371
In case he screams.

00:13:07.454 --> 00:13:09.456
Why aren't you threatening him,
you fucking pussy?

00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:11.333
You told him
you're not gonna kill him, didn't ya?

00:13:11.416 --> 00:13:14.294
Don't fucking push me. Okay?

00:13:14.378 --> 00:13:15.504
Don't!

00:13:16.839 --> 00:13:19.216
No fuel. Nowhere to go.

00:13:19.299 --> 00:13:21.051
What's the plan now, Captain?

00:13:24.513 --> 00:13:25.681
We get some petrol, right?

00:13:27.224 --> 00:13:28.517
We get to the boat…

00:13:29.852 --> 00:13:32.145
- and we let the kid go.
- Who's gonna get the petrol?

00:13:34.481 --> 00:13:35.482
What?

00:13:35.566 --> 00:13:37.150
Have you looked in the mirror?

00:13:38.026 --> 00:13:39.570
Who's gonna get out of the van?

00:13:42.364 --> 00:13:44.449
Fuck it. Fuck it.

00:13:48.579 --> 00:13:50.038
He is.

00:13:52.791 --> 00:13:56.170
Got him. Like a rat in a trap
that I will kill with a hammer.

00:13:57.546 --> 00:14:00.132
"Triple-D Car Hire." Leeds address.

00:14:00.215 --> 00:14:01.466
Registration number?

00:14:03.010 --> 00:14:04.094
That will take a while.

00:14:07.264 --> 00:14:08.348
Get me a coffee.

00:14:12.352 --> 00:14:13.896
I need fuel for this one.

00:14:13.979 --> 00:14:16.565
An SQL injection attack will take hours,

00:14:16.648 --> 00:14:19.276
which leaves a malware bomb
as the most effective method,

00:14:19.359 --> 00:14:22.070
but that needs someone
to open an email, so…

00:14:24.239 --> 00:14:26.825
Cheers, Standish. Double espresso.

00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:39.421
I thought you could hack anything.

00:14:40.130 --> 00:14:41.131
I can.

00:14:41.632 --> 00:14:44.343
I'm not saying I can't do it.
Just that it will take some time.

00:14:44.426 --> 00:14:45.844
How much time do you need, Ho?

00:14:45.928 --> 00:14:48.805
Because the kid's gonna get beheaded
in about two and a half hours.

00:14:50.432 --> 00:14:52.684
I'll tell you what I can do real quick.

00:14:52.768 --> 00:14:56.104
Check your search history
and tell everyone what porn you look at.

00:14:56.188 --> 00:14:57.689
Fine, 'cause I've got nothing to hide.

00:15:02.361 --> 00:15:03.612
- Don't you fucking dare.
- Hey.

00:15:03.695 --> 00:15:06.281
- Stop it. Stop it. Stop it.
- What's wrong with you?

00:15:06.365 --> 00:15:07.658
You're eight years old.

00:15:08.325 --> 00:15:10.202
- Pardon?
- Where's my coffee?

00:15:10.285 --> 00:15:13.413
I didn't get you a coffee.
I got you the registration number.

00:15:13.497 --> 00:15:15.165
DE15 CGK.

00:15:15.249 --> 00:15:17.042
- What? How?
- Well, I rang them up.

00:15:17.125 --> 00:15:20.128
And said what? "Do you mind breaking
multiple data protection laws?"

00:15:20.212 --> 00:15:23.298
No, I said th-that I'd had an accident
with one of their vehicles

00:15:23.382 --> 00:15:26.677
and I had the driver's name,
but because I was so shaken,

00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:29.638
I couldn't read
the registration number I'd written down.

00:15:30.889 --> 00:15:34.017
I think the words you're looking for, Ho,
and these would be a first for you,

00:15:34.101 --> 00:15:36.103
are, "Well done" and "Thank you."

00:15:37.312 --> 00:15:39.690
It's on the list of vehicles
the Park are looking for.

00:15:39.773 --> 00:15:41.984
Then we need to get them
to focus on that vehicle.

00:15:42.067 --> 00:15:43.944
How do we let the Park know
that without them tracking us?

00:15:44.027 --> 00:15:46.280
Oh, my God. Min, a kid's life is at stake.

00:15:46.363 --> 00:15:49.241
I know,
but Lamb told us not to get caught.

00:15:50.450 --> 00:15:51.994
Can't we track it ourselves?

00:16:09.761 --> 00:16:11.305
- Stop!
- Stop!

00:16:11.388 --> 00:16:12.681
Stop!

00:16:13.765 --> 00:16:14.766
Stop!

00:16:14.850 --> 00:16:16.059
Stay in the vehicle.

00:16:19.104 --> 00:16:20.564
<i>Yes, I know I'm gonna be</i>

00:16:20.647 --> 00:16:23.275
<i>I'm gonna be the man
Who's working hard for you</i>

00:16:24.693 --> 00:16:26.403
<i>And when the money</i>

00:16:26.486 --> 00:16:27.321
Stay there.

00:16:27.404 --> 00:16:31.116
<i>Comes in for the work I do
I'll pass almost every penny on to you</i>

00:16:32.326 --> 00:16:34.912
- Move! Move!
- Come on, let's go!

00:16:34.995 --> 00:16:36.288
Move!

00:16:37.331 --> 00:16:39.458
Go. Go. Move.

00:16:41.043 --> 00:16:42.336
<i>Well, I know I'm gonna be</i>

00:16:42.419 --> 00:16:45.756
<i>I'm gonna be the man
Who's growing old with you</i>

00:16:46.673 --> 00:16:50.260
<i>But I would walk 500 miles</i>

00:16:50.344 --> 00:16:54.389
<i>And I would walk 500 more</i>

00:16:57.392 --> 00:16:59.561
Can you get out of the vehicle, please,
Mr. Lamb?

00:17:00.270 --> 00:17:02.314
No, no. I'm quite comfortable
where I am.

00:17:02.397 --> 00:17:05.858
These seats are lovely.
And they're heated too.

00:17:05.943 --> 00:17:09.279
- Step out of the vehicle now.
- Nah, I'm okay where I am.

00:17:09.363 --> 00:17:12.950
You go fetch your boss and tell him
I've brought the car back,

00:17:13.032 --> 00:17:15.536
but we need to go over the damage waiver.

00:17:22.125 --> 00:17:25.628
You help us get petrol,
you help us get to the boat,

00:17:25.712 --> 00:17:27.214
and we will let you go. I swear.

00:17:28.924 --> 00:17:31.093
Yeah? Okay.

00:17:31.176 --> 00:17:33.804
Listen, be cool. Okay?

00:17:34.596 --> 00:17:36.807
He's seen all our faces, man.
He has got to go.

00:17:36.890 --> 00:17:40.185
No! Listen.
Why aren't you taking me seriously?

00:17:40.269 --> 00:17:42.020
'Cause I'm the one with the fucking gun,
remember?

00:17:42.104 --> 00:17:44.731
He's got a point. Look,
I don't like it either, but he's right.

00:17:44.815 --> 00:17:47.442
Please, please.
I'll say I never saw your faces

00:17:47.526 --> 00:17:50.445
or I never heard your voices
or I blanked it out from stress.

00:17:50.529 --> 00:17:52.865
Right now he'll say anything.

00:17:53.615 --> 00:17:55.242
My uncle's got money.

00:17:55.325 --> 00:17:56.451
Proving my point.

00:17:56.535 --> 00:17:58.287
No, straight up. My uncle's rich.

00:17:58.370 --> 00:18:01.874
Look, your exit plan, it-- it might not
work, but my uncle, he can sort that.

00:18:01.957 --> 00:18:05.544
- He can help you. He can make something--
- You little fucking lying rat!

00:18:05.627 --> 00:18:08.005
Hey! Hey! Fucking stop it!

00:18:11.383 --> 00:18:12.968
Your uncle.

00:18:13.802 --> 00:18:15.012
Where is he?

00:18:16.013 --> 00:18:17.014
Islamabad.

00:18:18.015 --> 00:18:19.183
Where?

00:18:19.266 --> 00:18:20.642
Pakistan.

00:18:20.726 --> 00:18:22.269
What the fuck use is that to us?

00:18:22.352 --> 00:18:24.813
- You get your money and you disappear.
- This is such fucking bullshit.

00:18:24.897 --> 00:18:27.649
- He's messing with ya.
- Fucking stop it. I'm thinking, okay?

00:18:27.733 --> 00:18:29.943
- That should take a while.
- Hey.

00:18:30.694 --> 00:18:33.488
Fucking don't. Okay? Don't.

00:18:40.329 --> 00:18:42.206
It's gotta be worth a shot, yeah.

00:18:43.498 --> 00:18:44.458
Yeah?

00:18:46.752 --> 00:18:50.631
But you're coming on the boat too, and you
stay with us till we get the money.

00:19:04.311 --> 00:19:08.482
<i>La la la, la la la
La la la, la la la</i>

00:19:11.818 --> 00:19:13.362
<i>La la la, la la la</i>

00:19:13.445 --> 00:19:14.988
Get out of the car.

00:19:15.072 --> 00:19:16.156
What?

00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:17.741
Get out of the car.

00:19:19.910 --> 00:19:21.662
Is this a joke?

00:19:21.745 --> 00:19:23.539
No, it's the Proclaimers.

00:19:23.622 --> 00:19:24.915
Get out of the--

00:19:28.961 --> 00:19:31.672
Nick, relax. I brought the car back.

00:19:31.755 --> 00:19:33.298
You pulled a gun on me.

00:19:33.924 --> 00:19:36.218
No, I delegated that. And any court of law

00:19:36.301 --> 00:19:37.845
will tell you there's a difference.

00:19:37.928 --> 00:19:41.557
And she didn't pull a gun on you.
She pulled a gun on your boy.

00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:43.684
Get out of the car.

00:19:45.602 --> 00:19:46.645
Are you gonna shoot me?

00:19:46.728 --> 00:19:49.773
- Not right now.
- Yeah, well, what about one of your lads?

00:19:49.857 --> 00:19:54.862
Hair triggers make natural
scratching posts for itchy indexes.

00:19:55.487 --> 00:19:57.072
They're not gonna do anything
unless you do.

00:19:57.155 --> 00:19:59.533
You got my word on that.
Now get out of the fucking car.

00:19:59.616 --> 00:20:00.784
All right. Good.

00:20:01.994 --> 00:20:04.538
'Cause I was wanting a little word
with Lady Di.

00:20:09.251 --> 00:20:10.252
All right.

00:20:11.295 --> 00:20:15.257
Just reaching for a peashooter.

00:20:15.340 --> 00:20:16.341
Here you go.

00:20:20.179 --> 00:20:21.346
Park it downstairs.

00:20:21.889 --> 00:20:23.265
I could murder a coffee.

00:20:23.765 --> 00:20:25.809
What's the canteen like in this gaff?

00:20:25.893 --> 00:20:27.269
Dogs en route. Stand by.

00:20:45.996 --> 00:20:47.581
What's your plan then, big man?

00:20:49.041 --> 00:20:53.045
Hey, you get out. You fill up the van.

00:20:53.128 --> 00:20:54.671
Nod, nod, nod.

00:20:54.755 --> 00:20:58.884
You fill up the van,
and we all get the fuck out of here.

00:20:58.967 --> 00:21:00.093
Yes?

00:21:04.973 --> 00:21:06.308
Give him some money.

00:21:08.435 --> 00:21:10.354
How do you know he won't do a runner?

00:21:11.813 --> 00:21:14.566
Hey, listen, kid. You've gotta come back.

00:21:14.650 --> 00:21:16.485
See that lady in the front filling up?

00:21:16.568 --> 00:21:18.320
The one with the two kids in the car?

00:21:19.404 --> 00:21:20.405
Hey!

00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:22.658
Do you see that woman?

00:21:26.912 --> 00:21:28.121
If you do anything wrong,

00:21:28.789 --> 00:21:31.542
I'll walk round to the back of the van,
and I'll get my axe out.

00:21:31.625 --> 00:21:34.211
And I'll cut her kids' heads off
in front of her.

00:21:34.294 --> 00:21:36.797
Then I'll cut her head off, then yours.

00:21:37.381 --> 00:21:38.715
And you know I'll do that, right?

00:21:39.842 --> 00:21:41.093
Yeah.

00:21:52.479 --> 00:21:54.606
Hey, kid. Don't fuck this up.

00:22:15.377 --> 00:22:16.545
Diesel, yeah?

00:22:18.630 --> 00:22:21.341
Knobhead. Keep your eye on him.

00:22:27.431 --> 00:22:30.267
Excuse me. Hello.

00:22:30.893 --> 00:22:33.353
- For fuck's sake.
- No, no, no.

00:22:33.437 --> 00:22:36.190
- Fuck off.
- I'm sorry, I need your help.

00:22:36.273 --> 00:22:39.109
Can't get me petrol cap back on.

00:22:41.195 --> 00:22:43.155
Maybe the attendant can help.

00:22:44.740 --> 00:22:47.242
Oh, no. 'Cause he's stuck behind glass
and, you know…

00:22:47.326 --> 00:22:49.286
- What's she saying?
- …the only way I can get…

00:22:49.369 --> 00:22:50.537
Fuck this.

00:22:50.621 --> 00:22:52.539
…I gotta get moving again soon.

00:22:55.751 --> 00:22:56.585
But I'll--

00:23:00.005 --> 00:23:03.300
But I'll, No, I'll work it out.

00:23:04.009 --> 00:23:06.929
Hey, Mervin. Help the poor woman.

00:23:08.805 --> 00:23:10.307
Hey, look, I'm sorry about him.

00:23:11.433 --> 00:23:14.645
Think he'd be a lot happier.
He's getting married in seven days.

00:23:17.814 --> 00:23:19.441
It's a stag weekend.

00:23:22.194 --> 00:23:23.987
Oh, God. Sorry.

00:23:24.738 --> 00:23:25.864
It's just 'cause you--

00:23:26.490 --> 00:23:28.575
You know, you look like that--

00:23:29.159 --> 00:23:31.078
You know, the-- That--

00:23:31.745 --> 00:23:34.414
- You know, the fell--
- Yeah. Yeah, I know. The--

00:23:34.498 --> 00:23:37.584
- The Pakistani boy that was kidnapped.
- Yeah.

00:23:37.668 --> 00:23:39.211
Yeah, I get it.

00:23:39.294 --> 00:23:40.504
Had it all bloody day.

00:23:41.171 --> 00:23:43.507
But I suppose we all just look
the same to you people, right?

00:23:44.716 --> 00:23:47.845
No. No, I wasn't--
It's just 'cause I was thinking--

00:23:47.928 --> 00:23:50.180
Hey, I was just joking.

00:23:51.056 --> 00:23:52.057
Yeah.

00:23:52.641 --> 00:23:53.767
Sorry.

00:23:53.851 --> 00:23:55.519
How about I look at that cap
for you, yeah?

00:23:55.602 --> 00:23:57.980
Yeah, that'd be-- Yeah, thank you.

00:24:07.114 --> 00:24:08.323
Hey. Knock that off now.

00:24:09.324 --> 00:24:10.367
I'm sorry they're up.

00:24:10.450 --> 00:24:12.619
- It's all right. It's not your fault.
- Nah, nah!

00:24:12.703 --> 00:24:14.413
That's really stuck in there,
isn't it?

00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:16.373
There you go.

00:24:16.456 --> 00:24:18.959
Hey, thank you. Have a good wedding.

00:24:19.668 --> 00:24:21.211
Yeah, thanks.

00:24:21.295 --> 00:24:24.381
Just gotta get through a weekend
with these miserable morons first.

00:24:43.150 --> 00:24:44.610
Go and pay the man.

00:24:51.909 --> 00:24:53.827
Hey, thank you again, love.

00:24:56.705 --> 00:24:58.123
Hi.

00:25:00.417 --> 00:25:01.460
She's leaving.

00:25:02.085 --> 00:25:03.795
There's nothing to stop him from running.

00:25:16.391 --> 00:25:19.228
Shit. Look at the TV.

00:25:27.236 --> 00:25:28.529
Excuse me.

00:25:30.656 --> 00:25:32.407
For fuck's sake.

00:25:34.826 --> 00:25:36.036
Pump number?

00:25:43.877 --> 00:25:45.337
Pump number?

00:25:52.511 --> 00:25:53.720
Pump number one.

00:25:57.224 --> 00:25:59.226
It's 94.60.

00:26:07.818 --> 00:26:09.319
Keep the change.

00:26:09.403 --> 00:26:10.654
Really?

00:26:10.737 --> 00:26:11.864
Thanks, buddy.

00:26:19.705 --> 00:26:21.415
Go on. Go on, get in.

00:26:26.003 --> 00:26:27.004
Shut the door.

00:26:30.007 --> 00:26:31.008
Good job, kid.

00:26:31.884 --> 00:26:33.844
- Good job.
- Did you get any change?

00:26:35.262 --> 00:26:36.471
I gave him a tip.

00:26:49.776 --> 00:26:51.778
Thank you, Nick. You can leave us now.

00:26:56.658 --> 00:26:58.452
Three sugars. There's a love.

00:27:02.372 --> 00:27:04.374
Alan Black's body's been found.

00:27:05.709 --> 00:27:06.960
Alan Black?

00:27:08.795 --> 00:27:09.922
It rings a bell.

00:27:10.005 --> 00:27:12.674
Ex-Slow Horse. Your man.

00:27:12.758 --> 00:27:15.302
Clearly involved
in the kidnapping of Hassan Ahmed.

00:27:16.428 --> 00:27:20.224
But you see, I remember a conversation
we had on a bench earlier this evening,

00:27:20.307 --> 00:27:24.269
where you told me you had a guy
on the inside

00:27:24.353 --> 00:27:26.730
who had set the whole thing up.
So not my man.

00:27:26.813 --> 00:27:30.234
I have a statement from someone
who saw you and Black

00:27:30.317 --> 00:27:32.653
meeting after he'd left Slough House.

00:27:32.736 --> 00:27:35.531
Struan Loy? Bless.

00:27:35.614 --> 00:27:38.242
You think his word stacks up against mine?

00:27:38.325 --> 00:27:40.202
There'll be others.

00:27:40.285 --> 00:27:41.787
Standish will show.

00:27:41.870 --> 00:27:44.289
And she'll turn when she knows
why you're at Slough House.

00:27:44.998 --> 00:27:47.125
And Moody, dead

00:27:47.209 --> 00:27:49.336
after committing murder himself.

00:27:53.507 --> 00:27:55.008
I'm sorry. I thought you knew.

00:27:56.760 --> 00:27:57.928
Sid Baker's gone.

00:28:06.603 --> 00:28:09.398
I'm gonna make you an offer, Jackson.

00:28:09.481 --> 00:28:10.732
I'm sure.

00:28:10.816 --> 00:28:13.151
I mean, obviously you have to have
this all wrapped up

00:28:13.235 --> 00:28:15.821
before Tearney lands,
and I can blow the whistle on you.

00:28:15.904 --> 00:28:17.531
You don't have a whistle.

00:28:18.448 --> 00:28:20.993
All you have is a CV littered
with dead joes.

00:28:21.076 --> 00:28:24.913
Well, I'm not sure your career
will survive the death of Hassan Ahmed.

00:28:24.997 --> 00:28:26.707
But anyway, make your pitch.

00:28:26.790 --> 00:28:30.002
I'm sure you've got some sweetener
to help me neck this absolute bullshit.

00:28:30.085 --> 00:28:33.881
Sign a statement that tallies with Loy's,
and that'll be the end of it.

00:28:33.964 --> 00:28:35.424
You mean the end of me.

00:28:35.507 --> 00:28:37.551
You'd be fired, but no charges.

00:28:37.634 --> 00:28:40.470
And enough of a pension to keep you
in single malts.

00:28:41.054 --> 00:28:44.349
A heavily redacted file will state
that you were thinking out loud

00:28:44.433 --> 00:28:46.226
and Black went rogue.

00:28:46.768 --> 00:28:47.936
When's Tearney get back?

00:28:48.020 --> 00:28:50.898
I mean, I'd love to run all this by her.

00:28:50.981 --> 00:28:53.275
Or we can sit here
and watch the Slow Horses

00:28:53.358 --> 00:28:57.029
walk in one by one and accept a job
back here at the Park,

00:28:57.112 --> 00:28:59.781
while you fester in the basement

00:28:59.865 --> 00:29:03.493
until this is all cleared up,
which I can make last a very long time.

00:29:03.577 --> 00:29:06.496
And if you get lonely,
I can always send Standish down.

00:29:08.123 --> 00:29:10.083
The treason charge against her
will be resurrected,

00:29:10.167 --> 00:29:11.960
and this time I can make it stick.

00:29:19.551 --> 00:29:21.386
I think I might have been bitten
at the canal.

00:29:25.474 --> 00:29:27.851
Well, it sounds like a wonderful deal.

00:29:28.477 --> 00:29:29.770
And hats off to you.

00:29:31.230 --> 00:29:32.898
You really got me boxed in.

00:29:34.983 --> 00:29:36.902
So print off a statement. Give me a pen.

00:29:38.278 --> 00:29:39.655
Fuck, I've just remembered.

00:29:40.656 --> 00:29:43.116
Yeah, there was something
I meant to tell you

00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:44.618
as soon as I walked in.

00:29:46.161 --> 00:29:48.580
The car that I returned.

00:29:48.664 --> 00:29:50.874
The one that's now parked in the basement.

00:29:51.792 --> 00:29:53.377
It's got a bomb in the boot.

00:30:05.681 --> 00:30:09.393
- <i>But I would walk 500 miles</i>
- Duffy.

00:30:38.505 --> 00:30:39.506
Fuck's sake.

00:30:50.559 --> 00:30:51.768
Fucking Lamb.

00:30:52.311 --> 00:30:53.562
What's he playing at?

00:30:58.192 --> 00:31:00.068
Shit. Secure the building!

00:31:00.152 --> 00:31:02.696
Search it floor by floor!
We've got an intruder!

00:31:04.072 --> 00:31:04.907
Door!

00:31:32.559 --> 00:31:36.146
- Now, tell me where the file is, please.
- What file? What are you even saying?

00:31:36.230 --> 00:31:37.606
Stop pissing around.
You know exactly what I mean.

00:31:37.689 --> 00:31:39.566
Whatever it is you think I have, I don't.

00:31:39.650 --> 00:31:41.652
Can you just put that thing down,
then we can--

00:31:43.362 --> 00:31:45.572
- Which one's the photograph in?
- What photograph?

00:31:45.656 --> 00:31:47.783
Taverner wanted me out
because she knew I took a photograph

00:31:47.866 --> 00:31:50.285
- of her and Alan Black.
- I don't know what you're talking about,

00:31:50.369 --> 00:31:52.412
but she had plenty of reasons
to want rid of you, mate.

00:31:52.496 --> 00:31:54.540
- You mean Stansted?
- Exactly. That's why you're out.

00:31:56.041 --> 00:31:58.836
I know what she did.
She got you to fuck me over at Stansted

00:31:58.919 --> 00:32:00.462
because she'd have
an excuse to get rid of me.

00:32:00.546 --> 00:32:02.005
It was your fiasco.

00:32:02.589 --> 00:32:06.218
Now, I'm pretty sure that she'll have
asked you to destroy that photograph.

00:32:06.301 --> 00:32:08.929
And I'm even more sure that
you'll have kept a copy for insurance.

00:32:09.012 --> 00:32:12.182
So tell me where they are, and then
I won't shoot you straight in the face.

00:32:13.267 --> 00:32:14.434
Sorry, mate. You lost me.

00:32:18.313 --> 00:32:19.606
Tell me where it is.

00:32:21.108 --> 00:32:22.150
Hey!

00:32:27.197 --> 00:32:28.574
Come on, come on, come on.

00:32:29.908 --> 00:32:31.159
Black.

00:32:31.743 --> 00:32:34.830
Black, Black, Black.

00:32:39.126 --> 00:32:40.460
Come on. Come on.

00:32:44.131 --> 00:32:45.007
Come on.

00:32:58.270 --> 00:32:59.271
No.

00:33:06.403 --> 00:33:09.323
<i>All teams. All teams.
Evacuate workstations.</i>

00:33:09.406 --> 00:33:14.286
<i>Please start approaching a secure area
with passes and ID.</i>

00:33:14.369 --> 00:33:16.205
<i>This is a 1470…</i>

00:33:16.288 --> 00:33:18.123
- Move! Move!
- Come on! Let's go!

00:33:18.207 --> 00:33:20.250
All right, everybody out this way!

00:33:29.009 --> 00:33:30.219
Stansted.

00:33:34.848 --> 00:33:37.017
- Move! Get out!
- Move! Move! Move! This way!

00:33:37.559 --> 00:33:38.560
Move!

00:33:38.644 --> 00:33:43.732
Stansted. Stansted, Stansted.

00:33:49.196 --> 00:33:55.202
Motherf-- Fiasco.

00:33:57.204 --> 00:33:58.205
Yeah.

00:34:02.042 --> 00:34:03.043
- Clear.
- Move.

00:34:03.126 --> 00:34:04.336
We're evacuating this area.

00:34:04.419 --> 00:34:05.629
Move!

00:34:05.712 --> 00:34:07.714
- Move, move, move.
- Out, out, out!

00:34:13.846 --> 00:34:15.889
- Coming through!
- Clear out!

00:34:19.141 --> 00:34:20.185
Out of the way!

00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:27.525
All clear! Out! Out!

00:34:27.609 --> 00:34:29.069
- Move!
- Move!

00:34:31.405 --> 00:34:33.532
Webb, we have a code 1470!

00:34:40.539 --> 00:34:43.458
- Down!
- Down! On the floor.

00:34:46.920 --> 00:34:49.840
<i>…extremely worrying,
and added to the investigation…</i>

00:34:54.136 --> 00:34:55.762
This is yours, I believe.

00:34:58.765 --> 00:35:01.518
Yeah. Must have forgot
to attach the bomb part.

00:35:04.396 --> 00:35:06.857
Duffy and his men are sweeping
the building as we speak.

00:35:06.940 --> 00:35:09.151
I assume it was Cartwright
you smuggled in.

00:35:09.234 --> 00:35:12.487
Nah, I thought it was helpful
to test your security.

00:35:12.571 --> 00:35:15.449
I've got bad news.
Your guys are not very good.

00:35:21.079 --> 00:35:23.165
Put him in the basement, next to Loy.

00:35:25.876 --> 00:35:27.461
You got the gist of that.

00:35:27.544 --> 00:35:31.173
Yeah. Well, if my guys
were as good as your guys,

00:35:31.256 --> 00:35:32.799
they'd be your guys.

00:35:32.883 --> 00:35:36.803
Now that little interlude is over,
perhaps you'd like to sign this.

00:35:42.434 --> 00:35:44.603
Before I do that, I just got one question.

00:35:44.686 --> 00:35:47.231
Who the fuck have you just
sent to the basement?

00:35:48.565 --> 00:35:49.566
Ma'am.

00:35:50.567 --> 00:35:52.194
- Good?
- Yeah.

00:35:52.277 --> 00:35:54.571
Oh, no. I wouldn't do that, ma'am.

00:35:55.614 --> 00:35:56.740
Fiasco.

00:36:06.208 --> 00:36:09.837
In three seconds, I could have
a dozen guns pointed at your heads.

00:36:09.920 --> 00:36:11.505
Yeah, but you won't do that.

00:36:12.005 --> 00:36:14.591
Because you don't want anyone
to see these.

00:36:17.678 --> 00:36:18.679
Here, look.

00:36:19.555 --> 00:36:23.225
There's you, and there's Alan Black.

00:36:24.643 --> 00:36:27.563
Remember setting up the thing
you're accusing me of?

00:36:28.397 --> 00:36:32.568
Kidnapping Hassan Ahmed
in a false flag operation

00:36:32.651 --> 00:36:36.989
so you could rescue him,
look good and score some points.

00:36:37.698 --> 00:36:41.451
You did tell me all that earlier,
but this is evidence.

00:36:42.202 --> 00:36:45.914
Yeah, I've put your name in.
If you'd just initial the changes.

00:36:45.998 --> 00:36:47.332
Sign at the bottom.

00:36:48.584 --> 00:36:51.128
I met with an ex-agent.
That means nothing.

00:36:51.211 --> 00:36:54.423
You won't mind if we
send this to Tearney then?

00:36:54.506 --> 00:36:57.217
- And everyone else at the Park.
- And Hobden, while we're at it.

00:36:57.301 --> 00:37:00.137
No, no. Hobden's a kook.
Send it to all the news desks.

00:37:00.220 --> 00:37:02.347
- News desks.
- What do you want?

00:37:02.431 --> 00:37:04.099
I want that kid found alive.

00:37:04.183 --> 00:37:05.309
And you think I don't?

00:37:05.392 --> 00:37:10.189
I think your attention's been split
between finding him and burning me.

00:37:14.318 --> 00:37:18.363
There are three possible vehicles.
We have lost track of all of them.

00:37:18.447 --> 00:37:20.616
We are doing everything we can.

00:37:20.699 --> 00:37:22.367
There's something more you could do.

00:37:22.451 --> 00:37:23.827
Cartwright got Hobden's phone.

00:37:23.911 --> 00:37:27.539
It turns out there's a certain someone
he called when it all went to shit.

00:37:28.457 --> 00:37:31.793
Maybe you should pay that someone a visit.

00:37:40.761 --> 00:37:44.556
Hey, this deal with your uncle,
how much money we talking?

00:37:45.474 --> 00:37:46.892
Well, name your price.

00:37:47.643 --> 00:37:49.186
What is he? A billionaire?

00:37:49.269 --> 00:37:53.148
No, he's got businesses
and lots of investments. Lots.

00:37:53.232 --> 00:37:56.109
Oh, yeah? Well, how come
he never helped you out before?

00:37:56.902 --> 00:37:59.279
You was living in a right shitheap
back in Leeds.

00:38:01.114 --> 00:38:04.243
He said he wanted me
to make my own way, like he did.

00:38:05.118 --> 00:38:06.870
But he wouldn't want me hurt.

00:38:06.954 --> 00:38:08.121
He wouldn't want me hurt.

00:38:08.205 --> 00:38:10.123
Hey, listen. Listen, why would he lie?

00:38:10.958 --> 00:38:13.418
Like you said,
he better not be bullshitting.

00:38:13.502 --> 00:38:16.547
Because if there is no uncle
and there is no money,

00:38:16.630 --> 00:38:19.132
- we're gonna find out, you know?
- The money will be there, I swear.

00:38:19.216 --> 00:38:22.344
- Okay? I promise it's there. My uncle--
- Yeah, all right, all right. All right!

00:38:22.427 --> 00:38:23.720
Jesus.

00:38:25.180 --> 00:38:26.974
Look, he did well at the petrol station.

00:38:27.558 --> 00:38:29.184
You did.

00:38:29.268 --> 00:38:31.436
So I'll give him
the benefit of the doubt.

00:38:32.646 --> 00:38:34.064
He can come with us.

00:38:35.482 --> 00:38:39.236
But only if he makes me laugh.

00:38:43.699 --> 00:38:44.741
If he fucking what?

00:38:46.451 --> 00:38:48.579
He's a comedian, isn't he?

00:38:49.621 --> 00:38:53.125
Well, I say "comedian."
He's never had the balls to go on stage.

00:38:55.335 --> 00:38:56.628
Come on, now!

00:38:56.712 --> 00:38:58.589
This is your big chance.
You wanna come with us, don't ya?

00:38:58.672 --> 00:39:01.133
- Roast us like on Comedy Central.
- Make us laugh.

00:39:01.216 --> 00:39:02.217
Go on!

00:39:03.135 --> 00:39:04.887
- Waiting.
- Okay, okay.

00:39:10.475 --> 00:39:13.478
So you're the Sons of Albion, huh?

00:39:15.272 --> 00:39:16.523
Just a hunch,

00:39:16.607 --> 00:39:18.942
but is Albion married to his first cousin?

00:39:20.485 --> 00:39:21.778
That's just fucking rude.

00:39:21.862 --> 00:39:23.906
That's the point. It's insults.

00:39:25.657 --> 00:39:26.575
Go on.

00:39:28.243 --> 00:39:29.620
"The Sons of Albion."

00:39:30.495 --> 00:39:32.581
Because "Unfuckable White Men
with Daddy Issues"

00:39:32.664 --> 00:39:34.541
doesn't quite fit on a neck tattoo,
does it?

00:39:36.627 --> 00:39:37.628
Dear me.

00:39:41.840 --> 00:39:43.383
I guess you got what you wanted.

00:39:44.384 --> 00:39:45.552
A Muslim bombing.

00:39:51.850 --> 00:39:53.310
Now, that's good.

00:39:53.393 --> 00:39:55.646
That is good. More.

00:39:57.689 --> 00:39:59.900
The Sons of Albion:

00:39:59.983 --> 00:40:02.986
Saving Great Britain from the infidels
Monday to Thursday,

00:40:03.612 --> 00:40:05.864
but can't resist a good curry
on a Friday night.

00:40:09.201 --> 00:40:10.410
He's talking about us!

00:40:11.954 --> 00:40:13.997
You know there's
1.8 billion Muslims in the world?

00:40:14.081 --> 00:40:15.457
- Yeah?
- He's on a roll.

00:40:15.541 --> 00:40:17.459
You're gonna need a bigger van, mate.

00:40:19.378 --> 00:40:21.296
Hey, do him.

00:40:21.380 --> 00:40:22.214
Do him.

00:40:22.297 --> 00:40:23.465
- Go on. Go on.
- Look at him.

00:40:23.549 --> 00:40:25.217
If he was any more inbred,
he'd be a sandwich.

00:40:26.677 --> 00:40:29.388
Another one! Another one!
This guy! Another one!

00:40:29.471 --> 00:40:32.808
And this one, he's so dumb,
he's got a note in his underpants:

00:40:32.891 --> 00:40:34.059
"Wipe arse. Use paper."

00:40:36.270 --> 00:40:37.271
Hey!

00:40:38.856 --> 00:40:40.357
You're fucking funny!

00:40:40.440 --> 00:40:42.484
He's laughing now! He's laughing--

00:40:42.568 --> 00:40:43.569
God!

00:40:44.236 --> 00:40:47.155
He's laughing now? He's laughing!

00:40:51.577 --> 00:40:52.744
Fuck!

00:41:07.301 --> 00:41:08.802
Now that's fucking funny.
