WEBVTT

00:00:15.015 --> 00:00:16.517
What is it?

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.477
Diana Taverner is downstairs.

00:00:20.854 --> 00:00:22.689
Tell her I'll be down in five minutes.

00:00:23.732 --> 00:00:25.651
She says to come straight down.

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:28.862
- What's going on, darling?
- Nothing, darling.

00:00:58.392 --> 00:01:00.143
I wonder what the others are up to.

00:01:04.397 --> 00:01:07.192
Could have called them if you hadn't
thrown away Min and Louisa's phones.

00:01:09.194 --> 00:01:11.238
Should let them know
they're not being hunted anymore,

00:01:11.321 --> 00:01:16.201
in case they're halfway through
some dodgy backstreet plastic surgery.

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.094
Can't hack the satnav.

00:02:16.178 --> 00:02:19.139
- Because?
- Cheap bastards didn't hire one.

00:02:19.223 --> 00:02:21.308
Or the flash bastards had their own.

00:02:21.391 --> 00:02:25.771
What I have done,
and which is beneath you puny mortals,

00:02:26.396 --> 00:02:28.482
is hack into
the van's Theft Recovery Transmitter.

00:02:28.565 --> 00:02:29.858
So we can track it?

00:02:30.484 --> 00:02:32.861
Signal's intermittent,
so you'll only get where the vehicle is

00:02:32.945 --> 00:02:34.071
or was every ten minutes.

00:02:34.821 --> 00:02:36.281
But they're heading east on the A12.

00:02:36.365 --> 00:02:39.618
Last ping from a petrol station
just outside Chelmsford.

00:02:40.244 --> 00:02:42.829
- What? So what do we do with this?
- Well, we call it in.

00:02:42.913 --> 00:02:45.749
To the Park? When they're trying to hang
the kidnap on us?

00:02:46.583 --> 00:02:48.085
Then we get it to someone else.

00:02:59.263 --> 00:03:01.682
Diana. I'm afraid our maid is asleep,

00:03:01.765 --> 00:03:04.142
so it's me on char duty.
What can I get you?

00:03:04.226 --> 00:03:06.895
Tea, please. Assam if you have it,
builder's otherwise.

00:03:07.437 --> 00:03:08.438
Milk, no sugar.

00:03:08.981 --> 00:03:11.733
- So, you know why I'm here?
- I've no idea why you're here.

00:03:11.817 --> 00:03:13.735
I think you do.
Otherwise, you'd have asked.

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:17.489
I've a woman in my kitchen I've met
a few times on the cocktail party circuit.

00:03:17.573 --> 00:03:20.742
I'm more concerned with how I'm going
to explain your presence to my wife.

00:03:20.826 --> 00:03:22.703
I can give her a précis if you like.

00:03:22.786 --> 00:03:25.539
We know from phone records
that Robert Hobden called you

00:03:25.622 --> 00:03:27.291
yesterday afternoon, repeatedly.

00:03:27.791 --> 00:03:30.043
None of the calls lasted
more than 15 seconds

00:03:30.127 --> 00:03:32.296
so clearly he couldn't get through.

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:35.048
Now, I could pull CCTV
from surrounding streets

00:03:35.132 --> 00:03:37.968
to confirm what I already know
but don't have the time to prove,

00:03:38.051 --> 00:03:42.389
which is that Hobden eventually turned up
here, desperate to talk to you.

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:46.310
Would you believe it?
After all that, no Assam.

00:03:46.393 --> 00:03:47.394
Have to be builder's.

00:03:47.978 --> 00:03:50.939
By the way, what's his name, Hobden?

00:03:51.481 --> 00:03:52.691
Haven't seen him for years.

00:03:52.774 --> 00:03:54.359
Doubt I'd recognize him if I did.

00:03:54.443 --> 00:03:58.155
Another thing I know but don't have
the time to prove at this exact moment

00:03:58.238 --> 00:04:00.866
is that after Hobden's visit,
calls were made,

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:02.868
by you or someone close to you,

00:04:02.951 --> 00:04:07.956
to certain individuals with links
to the people who kidnapped Hassan Ahmed.

00:04:08.957 --> 00:04:12.920
Again, I could pull up the phone records
for everyone in this building,

00:04:13.003 --> 00:04:15.005
starting with the man
listening at the door.

00:04:17.341 --> 00:04:19.134
And, of course, your phone records.

00:04:19.218 --> 00:04:22.846
I'm guessing there might be some numbers
you don't want your wife to know about.

00:04:23.347 --> 00:04:27.017
Those to the mothers of the children
she's not aware of, perhaps?

00:04:28.352 --> 00:04:31.355
- I have a very open marriage.
- I don't give a fuck about your marriage!

00:04:31.438 --> 00:04:34.983
I have a dead agent at the scene of a
kidnapping and a boy who's God knows where

00:04:35.067 --> 00:04:37.861
who'll be next to die,
all because of a phone call you made.

00:04:37.945 --> 00:04:40.948
I wish I could help you, Diana,
but I made no such call.

00:04:43.492 --> 00:04:46.411
I'm gonna turn on the kettle
for the tea you've failed to make.

00:04:46.495 --> 00:04:49.122
If you're not talking straight with me
by the time it boils,

00:04:49.206 --> 00:04:50.582
I'm going to call in the Dogs

00:04:50.666 --> 00:04:53.085
and begin the process
of turning your life inside out.

00:04:55.629 --> 00:04:56.755
Okay, thank you.

00:05:10.644 --> 00:05:13.105
Judging by the tone of the woman
who answered the phone,

00:05:13.188 --> 00:05:15.816
this was likely the 1,000th tip
they received today.

00:05:15.899 --> 00:05:17.818
Well, surely it made
a difference coming from you.

00:05:17.901 --> 00:05:19.486
Well, who was I to say was calling?

00:05:20.028 --> 00:05:21.029
"Hello, Scotland Yard?

00:05:21.113 --> 00:05:24.157
I'm with the punishment detail at MI5,
although at present,

00:05:24.241 --> 00:05:27.870
they're hunting me for the kidnapping
that I'm trying to help you solve."

00:05:37.004 --> 00:05:38.130
I'm going.

00:05:38.213 --> 00:05:40.257
- Where?
- Down the A12.

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:42.926
- You'll never catch them.
- I might if I put my foot down.

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:44.469
Pigs'll pull you over for speeding.

00:05:44.553 --> 00:05:45.721
How many times, we're the pigs.

00:05:45.804 --> 00:05:47.347
I won't stop.
I'll lead them to the kidnappers.

00:05:47.431 --> 00:05:49.057
Hey. Hold on. I'll come with you.

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:52.769
Roddy and I will go to Lamb's flat,
in case he shows.

00:05:52.853 --> 00:05:54.188
Lamb's not at his flat.

00:05:54.271 --> 00:05:55.522
And how do you know that?

00:05:55.606 --> 00:05:59.151
I put a tracker on his car a year ago.
I put one on all of your cars.

00:06:01.778 --> 00:06:05.324
What? I did it precisely
for a situation like this.

00:06:16.543 --> 00:06:20.172
This isn't about whether or not
Hobden was here or if I made a call.

00:06:20.255 --> 00:06:22.216
You're on the clock
and need me to do something,

00:06:22.299 --> 00:06:23.926
so why don't you just come out and ask?

00:06:24.009 --> 00:06:25.385
I want you to use your contacts

00:06:25.469 --> 00:06:28.180
in the far right to connect with
the head of the Sons of Albion.

00:06:28.263 --> 00:06:31.141
Find out where his boys might go
if they wanted to leave the country.

00:06:31.225 --> 00:06:32.559
I don't know Simmonds.

00:06:32.643 --> 00:06:34.394
You went grouse shooting
with him last year.

00:06:34.478 --> 00:06:36.230
There were a lot of people on that shoot.

00:06:36.313 --> 00:06:38.815
Just the two of you golfing
at Sunningdale, though.

00:06:38.899 --> 00:06:42.486
My sources say he thrashed you,
which is probably why you blanked it.

00:06:42.986 --> 00:06:44.363
Why should he do me any favors?

00:06:44.446 --> 00:06:46.490
Tell him I don't have time
to kick his door in,

00:06:46.573 --> 00:06:48.283
but I will if he leaves me no option.

00:06:48.367 --> 00:06:50.077
He gives them up within five minutes,

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:52.496
or the pair of you are having breakfast
in a holding cell.

00:06:53.539 --> 00:06:55.916
I know about the Frontline Club, Diana.

00:06:55.999 --> 00:06:59.878
And what Hobden overheard you say
to your brother, was it?

00:06:59.962 --> 00:07:03.590
Your one card. Are you sure
you want to play that now?

00:07:03.674 --> 00:07:06.176
Now is the only time to play it.
Game'll be over soon.

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:07.761
Then go and get dressed.

00:07:08.887 --> 00:07:11.598
I'll take the hit when it comes,
but you are going to the Park.

00:07:11.682 --> 00:07:15.185
Down to a floor with no number.
I'd wear something comfortable.

00:07:15.269 --> 00:07:18.063
Something you don't mind ruining
with piss, shit and blood.

00:07:18.146 --> 00:07:21.316
Now, now, Diana, I'm not suggesting
mutually assured destruction.

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:22.651
What are you suggesting?

00:07:23.318 --> 00:07:24.778
You and I share the same problem.

00:07:26.154 --> 00:07:28.657
Connection to the unsavories
through one man.

00:07:29.283 --> 00:07:30.325
Robert Hobden.

00:07:33.996 --> 00:07:36.707
I hope you don't mind if I listen in
when you make your calls.

00:08:00.063 --> 00:08:02.024
How the fuck did you find us?

00:08:06.278 --> 00:08:09.031
Well, put it back.
It'll come in handy if it gets nicked.

00:08:09.114 --> 00:08:12.743
They haven't cuffed us.
You must have the photographs.

00:08:12.826 --> 00:08:16.079
- Yeah. We checkmated Taverner.
- Were you planning on telling us?

00:08:16.163 --> 00:08:18.290
No, I was enjoying not seeing you.

00:08:18.373 --> 00:08:19.541
Where are Min and Louisa?

00:08:19.625 --> 00:08:22.169
Well, Ho worked out a way
to track the kidnappers.

00:08:22.252 --> 00:08:24.046
Min and Louisa are chasing after them.

00:08:24.129 --> 00:08:27.799
My orders were pretty clear. Do fuck all!

00:08:27.883 --> 00:08:30.594
You've let two Slow Horses tear off
in a doomed attempt

00:08:30.677 --> 00:08:32.304
to try and not make things worse.

00:08:32.386 --> 00:08:35.015
I didn't let them.
Jackson, they're autonomous beings.

00:08:35.097 --> 00:08:38.559
I just hope they only get themselves
killed and don't set an orphanage on fire.

00:08:39.645 --> 00:08:43.065
Keep tracking that van.
Let me know if it so much as changes lane.

00:08:45.192 --> 00:08:46.693
Think they're headed here.

00:08:48.237 --> 00:08:50.989
This is Duffy.
Get a tactical team airborne. Now.

00:08:53.784 --> 00:08:55.202
They're headed to Harwich.

00:08:55.285 --> 00:08:56.537
How did you know?

00:08:56.620 --> 00:09:01.750
Black used an old legend to hire a van.
Ho accessed the van's theft locator.

00:09:01.834 --> 00:09:05.212
They're on the A12.
Nearest port is Harwich.

00:09:05.295 --> 00:09:09.216
Standish and Ho will give you
all the various. I'm off for a kip.

00:09:14.471 --> 00:09:16.682
You're not actually
gonna go to bed, are you?

00:09:17.891 --> 00:09:19.226
You have something for us?

00:09:20.352 --> 00:09:23.021
That's the van's plate number
and the ID for the theft locator.

00:09:23.105 --> 00:09:25.065
They're going after the kidnappers,
aren't they?

00:09:25.148 --> 00:09:26.984
God, men are such boys.

00:09:27.067 --> 00:09:29.903
Ma'am, while I appreciate you
offering to include me

00:09:29.987 --> 00:09:32.489
in your circle of sisterhood,
I'll have to decline.

00:09:33.156 --> 00:09:35.033
Unless you want to fulfill
the promise you made

00:09:35.117 --> 00:09:37.411
and tell me what you know
about Partner's death?

00:09:37.494 --> 00:09:40.038
That ship sailed, Standish,
when you pulled a gun

00:09:40.122 --> 00:09:41.206
on one of my Dogs.

00:09:41.290 --> 00:09:45.919
Just think, if you'd returned my call,
you'd be back at the Park tomorrow.

00:09:46.003 --> 00:09:48.005
And why on earth would I want that?

00:09:49.882 --> 00:09:51.049
- Roddy.
- What?

00:09:51.633 --> 00:09:53.510
- Shut up and keep walking.
- Where?

00:09:53.594 --> 00:09:55.095
- Slough House.
- No, but that's--

00:09:55.179 --> 00:09:58.473
I know it's the other way, Roddy,
but I was in dire need of a dramatic exit.

00:09:59.016 --> 00:10:01.351
Do not look back.
That's just what she wants.

00:10:19.536 --> 00:10:21.622
They stopped for petrol,
headed east 20 minutes ago.

00:10:21.705 --> 00:10:23.540
- Sure it was them?
- Yeah, they made Hassan get it.

00:10:23.624 --> 00:10:24.791
Hassan? Why make him--

00:10:24.875 --> 00:10:26.919
The guy remembered him
because he left a tip.

00:10:27.002 --> 00:10:28.462
Did you not get any food?

00:10:28.545 --> 00:10:30.088
You can see I didn't. Let's go, Min.

00:10:30.172 --> 00:10:31.882
Do you mind if I nip in and get something?

00:10:31.965 --> 00:10:34.510
Yeah, sure. Only if you don't mind
admitting at Hassan's inquest

00:10:34.593 --> 00:10:36.386
that we arrived late
because you needed crisps.

00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:37.471
Okay, okay.

00:10:39.681 --> 00:10:41.099
Jesus Christ, Min. Hurry up!

00:10:41.183 --> 00:10:45.145
All right! I just function better
on a bit of food, that's all.

00:10:45.229 --> 00:10:46.396
For God's sake.

00:10:57.658 --> 00:10:59.284
I was seven, maybe eight.

00:10:59.368 --> 00:11:02.663
It was the first castle I saw up close.
All in ruins.

00:11:02.746 --> 00:11:07.918
You could play around it, climb on it.
My granddad said it was Norman.

00:11:09.002 --> 00:11:10.337
Very old.

00:11:11.839 --> 00:11:13.257
As England as England could be.

00:11:16.176 --> 00:11:17.386
Be a good spot for it.

00:11:17.469 --> 00:11:20.889
- Can we just go to the boat?
- How's your memory?

00:11:21.390 --> 00:11:22.391
Fine. What?

00:11:22.474 --> 00:11:24.935
'Cause you seem to be forgetting
what happened to the last person

00:11:25.018 --> 00:11:27.354
who asked,
"Can we not just go to the boat?"

00:11:27.437 --> 00:11:29.815
No, I mean we'll kill him, yeah?
We'll kill him!

00:11:29.898 --> 00:11:33.110
All right? But at the harbor
or the boat or something--

00:11:33.193 --> 00:11:34.194
Are you sure about that?

00:11:34.278 --> 00:11:37.656
Because it's pretty tricky swinging an axe
on a boat. I might miss. I might hit you.

00:11:37.739 --> 00:11:40.617
- Mate, time is running out--
- So is my fucking patience!

00:11:40.701 --> 00:11:41.994
Fucking hell!

00:11:42.077 --> 00:11:44.913
He won't shoot you at the wheel.
We'd crash, we might all die.

00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:50.043
Well, you're not at the wheel, are you?
What's to stop me shooting you?

00:11:51.211 --> 00:11:53.172
Because you want to chop my head off.

00:11:53.881 --> 00:11:55.632
You want me on my knees, remember?

00:11:57.676 --> 00:11:58.760
Not long now.

00:12:04.558 --> 00:12:05.976
<i>Van's 20 miles ahead of you.</i>

00:12:06.727 --> 00:12:07.936
Min and Louisa?

00:12:08.562 --> 00:12:09.605
Ten miles.

00:12:09.688 --> 00:12:11.481
Are you into the Park's feed?

00:12:12.065 --> 00:12:13.734
Was nearly there when you called.

00:12:13.817 --> 00:12:16.570
- Then stop talking!
- Well, no, wait, wait, Roddy.

00:12:16.653 --> 00:12:19.114
<i>When you get a sec,
can you get into the hospital's system</i>

00:12:19.198 --> 00:12:20.657
and find out how Sid is? And--

00:12:22.284 --> 00:12:23.285
What the fuck?

00:12:25.329 --> 00:12:29.499
You need to hear this from me,
not an insensitive prick like him.

00:12:32.294 --> 00:12:33.337
What, she's gone?

00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:37.841
Yeah.

00:12:47.601 --> 00:12:48.852
Count yourself lucky.

00:12:50.145 --> 00:12:51.271
Jesus Chri--

00:12:52.397 --> 00:12:54.691
Yeah, lucky me. Yeah.

00:12:54.775 --> 00:12:58.195
From my end of the telescope,
surviving's the short straw.

00:13:02.157 --> 00:13:07.037
By the time I was your age,
I'd lost a baker's dozen.

00:13:10.332 --> 00:13:11.917
It was bad enough when the Wall was up,

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.087
but once they reduced it to bricks
and rubble, everything went to shit.

00:13:16.213 --> 00:13:19.716
Whole networks of joes rounded up, blown.

00:13:21.301 --> 00:13:22.803
I haven't forgotten any of them.

00:13:26.139 --> 00:13:27.558
And I won't forget Sid.

00:13:32.521 --> 00:13:36.984
- Besides, she was the only one of you--
- Who wasn't complete shit.

00:13:37.067 --> 00:13:38.777
Yeah, yeah. You-- You've said that.

00:13:43.866 --> 00:13:47.244
Any rate, the moral of the story is,
get used to death.

00:13:49.329 --> 00:13:51.373
Cause you're gonna see a lot more of it.

00:13:51.456 --> 00:13:54.501
And if that scares you,
then open the door and roll out now.

00:14:20.027 --> 00:14:22.112
Out. Get the f--

00:14:25.532 --> 00:14:26.658
Get our friend out.

00:14:32.039 --> 00:14:33.457
Get rid of him.

00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:35.292
In there. And you're helping.

00:14:35.876 --> 00:14:37.044
You get his legs. Go on.

00:14:58.398 --> 00:15:01.527
Once he's killed me, he's gonna
wanna go out in a blaze of glory.

00:15:03.111 --> 00:15:04.112
If you're with him,

00:15:04.196 --> 00:15:05.989
- you'll get killed in the cross fire.
- Shut up!

00:15:06.073 --> 00:15:09.243
All right. Tie his hands and feet.
Make sure he can't run.

00:15:13.664 --> 00:15:16.667
- Help me escape. Please.
- Shut the fuck up!

00:15:16.750 --> 00:15:18.210
The fuck's going on in there?

00:15:20.629 --> 00:15:22.631
You didn't know. You didn't know.

00:15:30.138 --> 00:15:32.140
All right, get up. Here.

00:15:33.267 --> 00:15:35.811
Fucking-- Go on. Go on.

00:15:59.459 --> 00:16:00.961
What the hell, Min?

00:16:01.044 --> 00:16:02.546
Well, I've run out of petrol.

00:16:03.297 --> 00:16:04.798
Are you fucking kidding?

00:16:05.465 --> 00:16:08.177
How can we be out of petrol?
We were just at a petrol station.

00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:10.470
Well, hang on. We were--
We weren't stopping for petrol.

00:16:10.554 --> 00:16:12.472
Yeah, I know.
Otherwise you'd have got fucking petrol!

00:16:12.556 --> 00:16:13.640
We were stopping for intel.

00:16:13.724 --> 00:16:16.602
I got the intel! What were you doing
whilst I was doing that?

00:16:17.477 --> 00:16:19.521
I-- I was distracted.
I was thinking about stuff.

00:16:19.605 --> 00:16:20.689
What stuff?

00:16:20.772 --> 00:16:22.274
I don't know. Nothing.

00:16:22.357 --> 00:16:23.901
No, no one thinks about nothing, Min,

00:16:23.984 --> 00:16:26.028
unless they're a Zen master.
Are you a Zen master?

00:16:26.111 --> 00:16:28.739
No, I'm not! No, I'm tired.
I was thinking about sleeping.

00:16:28.822 --> 00:16:29.823
Food, you know.

00:16:30.324 --> 00:16:32.117
- Fuck.
- Oh, my God.

00:16:32.826 --> 00:16:33.827
What?

00:16:33.911 --> 00:16:35.245
You were thinking about sex.

00:16:37.206 --> 00:16:38.207
No.

00:16:38.290 --> 00:16:40.292
Yes, you were.
Specifically about shagging me.

00:16:41.126 --> 00:16:42.127
No.

00:16:43.128 --> 00:16:44.922
Jesus fucking Christ!

00:16:50.469 --> 00:16:52.054
No! Fucking stand over there!

00:16:55.182 --> 00:16:56.141
Over there!

00:16:57.142 --> 00:16:58.352
Nowhere fucking near me.

00:16:59.228 --> 00:17:00.395
- Here?
- Yeah.

00:17:09.530 --> 00:17:10.531
You've got an axe.

00:17:11.656 --> 00:17:13.116
Yeah, and he's got a gun.

00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:15.993
- Please. Please.
- Quiet.

00:17:16.828 --> 00:17:18.997
- You know we're both dead.
- Stay on the paths!

00:17:19.080 --> 00:17:20.624
You know we're both dead.

00:17:21.541 --> 00:17:23.961
Stay on the paths! Stay on it!

00:17:31.635 --> 00:17:33.303
Get down. Get down.

00:17:39.226 --> 00:17:40.352
Don't move.

00:17:49.945 --> 00:17:51.446
Come on, give me your hands.

00:18:07.754 --> 00:18:09.006
Bastards!

00:18:11.133 --> 00:18:12.134
Back to the van?

00:18:12.217 --> 00:18:14.344
I'm going back to the van.
You're going the other way.

00:18:15.429 --> 00:18:17.139
Where are you?

00:18:17.222 --> 00:18:19.433
- Run!
- Where are you?

00:18:19.516 --> 00:18:20.517
Fuck!

00:18:21.894 --> 00:18:22.978
Fuck!

00:18:25.856 --> 00:18:27.482
I fucked up! He gave me the slip!

00:18:27.566 --> 00:18:29.359
- What? Fucking where?
- I don't know!

00:19:38.178 --> 00:19:39.596
Where am I?

00:19:54.194 --> 00:19:56.321
I want you to bring
the boy's parents to London

00:19:56.405 --> 00:19:57.865
ahead of a successful outcome.

00:19:57.948 --> 00:19:59.825
Do not let the press get wind of this.

00:19:59.908 --> 00:20:00.909
Diana.

00:20:00.993 --> 00:20:02.870
Diana. Your office.

00:20:03.495 --> 00:20:04.496
Ma'am…

00:20:10.752 --> 00:20:13.672
The kidnappers are headed for Harwich,
and the Dogs are en route.

00:20:14.673 --> 00:20:17.676
Well… Now we wait.

00:20:19.511 --> 00:20:21.513
- Slow Horses in the building?
- They've been cleared.

00:20:22.598 --> 00:20:24.766
It appears Alan Black was operating alone.

00:20:25.976 --> 00:20:29.188
Either he was trying to be the hero,
or he went full right-wing nationalist.

00:20:29.271 --> 00:20:31.732
- It's hard to tell.
- Either version makes us look terrible.

00:20:33.650 --> 00:20:35.360
I'd prefer his story died with him.

00:20:35.903 --> 00:20:37.696
It's being written out already.

00:20:37.779 --> 00:20:41.992
Can I request he's kept out? No witnesses…

00:20:43.076 --> 00:20:45.704
They are dangerous men.
They will be met with force.

00:21:01.428 --> 00:21:04.556
Look, it's been a while for me, okay?

00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:05.641
Since you had sex?

00:21:05.724 --> 00:21:07.476
No, no, si--

00:21:07.559 --> 00:21:09.895
since I've been with someone
who doesn't completely fucking loathe me.

00:21:11.063 --> 00:21:16.443
And… you know, us--
us kissing in the stairwell, that was--

00:21:16.527 --> 00:21:17.694
I mean, that was good.

00:21:18.612 --> 00:21:21.281
It was great. But then us going upstairs
with the paperweight

00:21:21.365 --> 00:21:22.950
and the stapler, that was amazing.

00:21:23.033 --> 00:21:25.869
I mean, that was--
You know, we were good. We were a team.

00:21:27.162 --> 00:21:30.958
You know.
I mean, we had each other's back.

00:21:31.917 --> 00:21:32.960
Bit cheesy.

00:21:34.837 --> 00:21:39.174
And now we've got no petrol and no way
to catch up to the bastards, so…

00:21:39.258 --> 00:21:41.969
We were never gonna catch them, were we?

00:21:42.052 --> 00:21:44.972
Just felt good being part of
something, didn't it, you know?

00:21:49.184 --> 00:21:50.185
Two years.

00:21:51.937 --> 00:21:53.272
Since you last had sex?

00:21:53.897 --> 00:21:54.898
God, no.

00:21:56.650 --> 00:21:57.818
Since someone had my back.

00:22:02.823 --> 00:22:04.449
- There's Lamb!
- Lamb!

00:22:05.534 --> 00:22:06.535
Lamb!

00:22:06.618 --> 00:22:09.454
- Hey!
- Hey! For fuck's sake!

00:22:10.163 --> 00:22:11.290
You not gonna stop?

00:22:11.373 --> 00:22:13.041
We're ten minutes from Harwich.

00:22:13.125 --> 00:22:17.880
Dogs, bad guys, guns.
You want to miss the show?

00:23:26.990 --> 00:23:27.991
<i>We have a visual.</i>

00:23:28.075 --> 00:23:30.327
They're armed. Lethal force authorized.

00:23:42.381 --> 00:23:46.009
Listen to me! Listen to me!
Get down! On your knees!

00:23:48.178 --> 00:23:49.388
Get down on your knees.

00:23:56.061 --> 00:23:57.187
Hands visible!

00:24:00.691 --> 00:24:02.651
Keep your hands visible!

00:24:04.862 --> 00:24:06.321
He's reaching. Drop him.

00:24:15.789 --> 00:24:18.417
<i>All units to Control.
Target down, target down.</i>

00:24:24.256 --> 00:24:25.340
Van is empty, ma'am.

00:24:43.609 --> 00:24:44.776
Suspect was armed, ma'am.

00:24:47.905 --> 00:24:49.740
Retrace the route. Meter by meter.

00:24:51.491 --> 00:24:52.993
<i>Van got to Harwich.</i>

00:24:53.076 --> 00:24:57.414
Dogs shredded a kidnapper.
Pretty wild. I got some headcam footage.

00:24:57.915 --> 00:25:00.000
<i>Taverner's not taking any prisoners.</i>

00:25:00.083 --> 00:25:01.543
Roddy, Roddy. Hassan?

00:25:04.129 --> 00:25:06.757
No sign of him or the other kidnappers.

00:25:06.840 --> 00:25:08.509
Where did the van last stop?

00:25:09.134 --> 00:25:11.261
-<i>Lay-by. Five miles behind you.</i>
- Shit.

00:25:20.103 --> 00:25:23.190
You know, I knew you were trying to turn
him when you were dumping that body.

00:25:23.690 --> 00:25:27.152
And I knew he was never a real soldier.
No harm done.

00:25:28.403 --> 00:25:29.613
Apart from him scalping you.

00:25:30.239 --> 00:25:33.033
Head wounds bleed.
It all worked out in the end.

00:25:33.742 --> 00:25:36.662
He got away. How is that "all worked out"?

00:25:36.745 --> 00:25:39.164
- I let him go.
- Sure.

00:25:39.248 --> 00:25:43.752
Not that you're a crap shot.
That's not why he escaped. You let him go.

00:25:43.836 --> 00:25:46.171
Listen, I could shoot you right now, mate.

00:25:46.255 --> 00:25:48.173
But we're gonna do things medieval,

00:25:48.257 --> 00:25:50.259
which is appropriate,
considering your religion.

00:25:51.927 --> 00:25:54.179
You don't know the first thing
about my religion.

00:26:08.026 --> 00:26:10.028
What the fuck. They've come back.

00:26:14.908 --> 00:26:16.285
Well, come on. Get in, then!

00:26:20.581 --> 00:26:21.832
Fuck.

00:26:23.166 --> 00:26:25.627
- We forgot to get petrol.
- We?

00:26:29.965 --> 00:26:31.008
There.

00:26:32.509 --> 00:26:35.012
What the fuck are you laughing at?
You're gonna die up there.

00:26:35.095 --> 00:26:37.514
- That's not a Norman castle.
- Yes it fucking is!

00:26:37.598 --> 00:26:39.349
- It's a folly.
- It's a what?

00:26:39.433 --> 00:26:41.310
A folly. A fake.

00:26:41.393 --> 00:26:43.061
Fake how? It's still a castle.

00:26:43.145 --> 00:26:46.648
It's around 150 years old,
built to look older.

00:26:46.732 --> 00:26:49.109
Why would people build ruins?
That makes no sense.

00:26:49.610 --> 00:26:51.862
Because they wanted to impress people.

00:26:51.945 --> 00:26:54.114
Because they th-thought
that it was romantic.

00:26:54.198 --> 00:26:56.116
- Because they thought it was English.
- It is English.

00:26:56.200 --> 00:26:57.367
It's fake.

00:26:57.451 --> 00:27:00.787
Seems I paid more attention in my madrassa
than you did in school.

00:27:03.165 --> 00:27:05.417
Get up. Get the fuck up. Move.

00:27:06.001 --> 00:27:07.002
Move!

00:27:09.880 --> 00:27:10.923
Keep going.

00:27:17.012 --> 00:27:18.013
In there.

00:27:36.573 --> 00:27:37.783
Are you sure this is right?

00:27:38.450 --> 00:27:42.079
You are at the right location.
I've done my bit. Over to you.

00:27:42.162 --> 00:27:45.123
Right. Ho, there's no "I" in "team,"
but there is a big "fuck you" in fuck you.

00:27:45.207 --> 00:27:47.584
Roddy, Roddy, there's nothing here.
Look again.

00:27:47.668 --> 00:27:49.253
<i>That is where they stopped.</i>

00:27:49.336 --> 00:27:50.879
This is the place.

00:27:50.963 --> 00:27:53.590
Three men came into the woods.
One came out.

00:27:53.674 --> 00:27:56.093
I'm assuming the one
who took the van to Harwich.

00:27:56.176 --> 00:27:57.177
How do you know?

00:27:57.719 --> 00:27:59.555
Reading the signs of the earth.

00:27:59.638 --> 00:28:01.473
What, like snapped branches,
trampled grass?

00:28:02.182 --> 00:28:04.685
No, you dozy sod.
The dead body over there.

00:28:08.814 --> 00:28:10.065
Fuck me.

00:28:44.683 --> 00:28:46.560
Cleared to shoot on sight.

00:28:47.102 --> 00:28:48.395
Affirmative.

00:29:12.252 --> 00:29:13.378
So what now?

00:29:14.588 --> 00:29:15.672
You kill me.

00:29:15.756 --> 00:29:17.883
Put it on YouTube. Run to the boat.

00:29:23.805 --> 00:29:24.806
Kneel.

00:29:25.641 --> 00:29:27.226
Fuckin' kneel!

00:29:28.769 --> 00:29:29.895
The boat is blown.

00:29:29.978 --> 00:29:31.980
Once that video's online, they'll be here,

00:29:32.064 --> 00:29:35.150
and either they take me out,
or I use the last one on myself.

00:29:39.988 --> 00:29:43.408
So you become a martyr.
Like all the suicide bombers.

00:29:43.492 --> 00:29:46.286
It's about being part of
something bigger than yourself.

00:29:47.037 --> 00:29:50.624
Not that you'd understand.
I'm putting this country first.

00:29:51.834 --> 00:29:53.043
It's what won us the war.

00:29:53.794 --> 00:29:55.879
You are so fucking stu--

00:30:00.217 --> 00:30:01.593
Told you I was a good shot.

00:30:02.177 --> 00:30:04.137
Next one's in your balls.

00:30:25.784 --> 00:30:28.412
Hassan, Hassan! Hassan. Stop, stop.

00:30:28.495 --> 00:30:29.830
- Who are you with?
- I'm with MI5.

00:30:29.913 --> 00:30:32.541
You're safe. You're safe now.
Look. Put it down. Give me the axe.

00:30:32.624 --> 00:30:34.459
- You're gonna stop me?
- You don't want to kill him.

00:30:34.543 --> 00:30:36.003
- He's done. Finished.
- Like fuck I don't!

00:30:36.086 --> 00:30:37.462
Hassan. Look at me, Hassan. No.

00:30:37.546 --> 00:30:39.673
No. No! Hassan, Hassan!

00:30:42.050 --> 00:30:43.510
You make me ashamed to be British.

00:30:43.594 --> 00:30:45.429
All right. Come on. Let's step away.
Step away.

00:30:45.512 --> 00:30:47.264
Back up. Back up. Good man.

00:31:03.030 --> 00:31:04.573
<i>Twenty seconds to target.</i>

00:31:08.327 --> 00:31:09.786
Okay. Okay.

00:31:09.870 --> 00:31:13.624
Okay. Okay. Let's just sit down.
There you are. Okay.

00:31:13.707 --> 00:31:16.168
Okay. Hassan? I'm gonna have to stop
the bleeding on that arm.

00:31:17.044 --> 00:31:18.337
That's it, that's it.

00:31:18.420 --> 00:31:19.838
There you are. Good man.

00:31:19.922 --> 00:31:21.965
Can you ring my parents?

00:31:22.633 --> 00:31:24.801
Don't really have a phone
at the minute. Sorry.

00:31:24.885 --> 00:31:26.136
What kind of spy are you?

00:31:27.137 --> 00:31:28.180
Yeah. Hard to tell, really.

00:31:40.317 --> 00:31:42.528
- Who's that?
- That's Cartwright and the Slow Horses.

00:31:45.447 --> 00:31:47.491
Assessing target. Stand by.

00:31:54.206 --> 00:31:56.124
<i>Intel confirms bomb threat.</i>

00:31:56.208 --> 00:31:57.251
Southeast wall.

00:32:00.295 --> 00:32:01.547
Kill order confirmed.

00:32:02.673 --> 00:32:04.216
There you are. You've done it now.

00:32:05.008 --> 00:32:07.886
Are they gonna kill him?
He should go on trial.

00:32:10.556 --> 00:32:12.766
Min! What are you doing?

00:32:12.850 --> 00:32:14.726
Friendly approaching target.

00:32:18.146 --> 00:32:19.314
He's unarmed!

00:32:20.941 --> 00:32:21.942
Jesus.

00:32:22.734 --> 00:32:24.152
Clear the shot!

00:32:25.404 --> 00:32:28.407
- Piss off! Stop!
- What the fuck are you doing?

00:32:28.490 --> 00:32:30.492
You're gonna get yourself freaking killed!

00:32:30.576 --> 00:32:33.245
Suspect is armed. Clear the shot!

00:32:33.328 --> 00:32:36.290
You are impeding an official operation!

00:32:36.373 --> 00:32:37.916
<i>Clear! Now!</i>

00:33:00.522 --> 00:33:01.648
No clear shot, sir.

00:33:02.357 --> 00:33:03.775
Piss off!

00:33:03.859 --> 00:33:04.860
<i>Ma'am?</i>

00:33:07.070 --> 00:33:08.322
Ma'am?

00:33:09.740 --> 00:33:10.824
Stand down.

00:33:12.868 --> 00:33:14.161
Fuck off.

00:33:43.315 --> 00:33:44.316
Diana.

00:33:51.782 --> 00:33:54.284
Your idiot Slow Horses have screwed
the entire service.

00:33:55.369 --> 00:33:56.537
The boy was saved.

00:33:56.620 --> 00:33:59.873
The boy and the surviving kidnapper
both know we had an agent on the inside.

00:33:59.957 --> 00:34:02.000
- I'll handle that.
- Like you handled the rest of this?

00:34:04.545 --> 00:34:06.547
Alan Black has been wiped
from our records,

00:34:06.630 --> 00:34:08.549
and I'll make sure Hassan says nothing.

00:34:08.632 --> 00:34:11.467
You better fucking had!
This is your shit, Diana.

00:34:11.552 --> 00:34:12.553
Clean it up!

00:35:41.683 --> 00:35:45.646
<i>I'm joined now by our Home
Security correspondent, Derek Rothery.</i>

00:35:45.729 --> 00:35:49.650
<i>Derek, what can you tell us
about the investigation so far?</i>

00:35:49.733 --> 00:35:52.402
<i>We understand
that First Desk, Ingrid Tearney,</i>

00:35:52.486 --> 00:35:55.030
<i>will be debriefing
the Home Secretary later on today</i>

00:35:55.614 --> 00:36:00.494
<i>on what has been a successful operation
to rescue kidnapped student Hassan Ahmed.</i>

00:36:00.577 --> 00:36:02.913
<i>I'd just like to say thank you</i>

00:36:02.996 --> 00:36:07.543
<i>to the police a-and the security services</i>

00:36:07.626 --> 00:36:10.504
<i>for their really, really incredible work.</i>

00:36:11.004 --> 00:36:13.841
<i>We understand he was freed
shortly after 7:00 a.m. this morning</i>

00:36:13.924 --> 00:36:18.095
<i>by an MI5 operation in which
two of the kidnappers were killed,</i>

00:36:18.178 --> 00:36:20.597
<i>and a further man remains in custody.</i>

00:36:24.560 --> 00:36:27.229
Well, I suppose well done, us.

00:36:27.938 --> 00:36:30.691
I've got a bottle of wine
in the desk if anyone wants to celebrate.

00:36:31.567 --> 00:36:33.360
Celebrate? What?

00:36:34.528 --> 00:36:35.529
Well, we saved him.

00:36:35.612 --> 00:36:38.115
How? You-- You were useless.

00:36:38.198 --> 00:36:39.449
I tracked the van.

00:36:39.533 --> 00:36:42.160
Yeah, to Harwich,
where the Dogs were waiting for him.

00:36:42.244 --> 00:36:43.704
Thanks to me squeezing Lady Di.

00:36:43.787 --> 00:36:45.664
Yeah, well, I actually did save him.

00:36:45.747 --> 00:36:47.749
Whilst he was being shot at
and threatened with an axe.

00:36:47.833 --> 00:36:50.794
The kid saved himself, with a rock.

00:36:50.878 --> 00:36:52.838
I just love these team talks, I really do.

00:36:54.423 --> 00:36:56.341
Come on, everyone. Back to work!

00:36:56.425 --> 00:36:57.551
It's Saturday.

00:36:57.634 --> 00:36:59.386
Then everyone piss off!

00:36:59.469 --> 00:37:00.470
Drink?

00:37:03.724 --> 00:37:05.100
Got a lead on Sid.

00:37:13.942 --> 00:37:15.777
Okay. Wine.

00:37:20.157 --> 00:37:23.202
Right. Well, I hope you don't mind,
a <i>vin de</i> Tesco.

00:37:24.244 --> 00:37:26.121
Yeah. I'll get some glasses.

00:37:27.122 --> 00:37:28.957
- All right.
- Actually, you know what, Min?

00:37:29.041 --> 00:37:34.880
I-- I am-- I'm shattered.
I'm gonna crash. Sorry.

00:37:35.839 --> 00:37:36.965
Yeah. Sure. Sure.

00:37:37.049 --> 00:37:38.258
It's been a long day.

00:37:38.759 --> 00:37:39.885
Yeah. No, I'm tired too.

00:37:44.181 --> 00:37:48.435
But I am free tonight for some drinks or…

00:37:49.311 --> 00:37:50.729
maybe some food or something.

00:37:50.812 --> 00:37:51.813
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah?

00:37:51.897 --> 00:37:53.106
Great. Sounds good.

00:37:54.274 --> 00:37:56.068
Yeah, I'm just thinking how about--

00:37:56.151 --> 00:37:59.112
Well, how about I just actually
stop talking before I spoil everything?

00:37:59.196 --> 00:38:00.197
Smart.

00:38:19.466 --> 00:38:21.760
- See?
- See what? I don't see anything.

00:38:21.844 --> 00:38:22.845
Exactly.

00:38:22.928 --> 00:38:25.389
There's no record of her
ever having been at the hospital.

00:38:25.472 --> 00:38:27.724
And, when I pop through
my own private backdoor

00:38:27.808 --> 00:38:29.101
into MI5's database,

00:38:29.184 --> 00:38:31.228
there's no record of her whatsoever.

00:38:31.311 --> 00:38:32.729
So what does that mean?

00:38:34.273 --> 00:38:38.694
It means, far as you know,
and even as far as Roddy Ho knows,

00:38:38.777 --> 00:38:41.655
which is a fuck of a lot farther
than anyone has ever known,

00:38:42.239 --> 00:38:44.324
there is gonna be
no funeral or memorial service

00:38:44.408 --> 00:38:46.660
or so much as drinks at the pub
for Sidonie Baker.

00:38:48.537 --> 00:38:51.373
'Cause no one
named Sidonie Baker ever existed.

00:38:58.547 --> 00:39:01.133
So, in return?

00:39:03.594 --> 00:39:04.595
In return for what?

00:39:04.678 --> 00:39:07.848
For letting you know
she might still be alive somewhere.

00:39:10.184 --> 00:39:11.185
You wanna know?

00:39:15.397 --> 00:39:16.398
All right.

00:39:18.192 --> 00:39:19.193
Well…

00:39:21.862 --> 00:39:25.240
thing is, Roddy, you're in Slough House…

00:39:33.999 --> 00:39:35.167
because you're too good.

00:39:37.169 --> 00:39:39.171
You showed everyone else up.

00:39:39.254 --> 00:39:41.798
Made them all look bad,
so they shoved you in here.

00:39:46.637 --> 00:39:47.638
Figures.

00:39:50.933 --> 00:39:52.142
Tried to cage me up…

00:39:53.936 --> 00:39:55.771
but you can't cage a dragon.

00:40:06.949 --> 00:40:07.950
All right.

00:41:20.814 --> 00:41:24.526
Natasha. You need to bring me in
and put me on air.

00:41:26.236 --> 00:41:28.739
But what you're seeing
on the news is bullshit!

00:41:28.822 --> 00:41:31.491
Establishment cover-up bullshit.

00:41:33.035 --> 00:41:34.036
Well, send a car.

00:41:35.329 --> 00:41:39.082
I can get there quicker by myself.
I can be there in--

00:41:42.252 --> 00:41:45.005
Jesus. You all right, mate? You all right?

00:41:45.088 --> 00:41:46.840
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

00:41:57.559 --> 00:41:58.560
Diana.

00:41:59.061 --> 00:42:00.062
Jackson.

00:42:01.772 --> 00:42:02.814
Well done.

00:42:02.898 --> 00:42:06.276
Managed to keep the name Alan Black
out of the headlines.

00:42:06.360 --> 00:42:08.111
Never existed.

00:42:08.737 --> 00:42:11.073
You mean Dermot Radcliffe, Son of Albion.

00:42:15.160 --> 00:42:20.249
Hassan didn't overhear anything
that might poke holes in that?

00:42:20.332 --> 00:42:21.333
Possibly.

00:42:21.834 --> 00:42:23.460
But his student debt's been cleared,

00:42:23.544 --> 00:42:26.922
and his comedy club is about to receive
a large anonymous donation.

00:42:29.758 --> 00:42:31.593
Do you know what boils my piss?

00:42:33.011 --> 00:42:34.012
Is that you won.

00:42:35.055 --> 00:42:38.559
Boy saved, you get to look like a hero.

00:42:38.642 --> 00:42:40.811
Made your boss look even more of a hero.

00:42:42.479 --> 00:42:44.731
What are you gonna tell Standish
about what's in that file?

00:42:48.110 --> 00:42:50.195
And the photographs on Cartwright's phone?

00:42:51.154 --> 00:42:52.155
Deleted.

00:42:52.698 --> 00:42:54.116
Can I trust you on that?

00:42:56.118 --> 00:42:58.662
Can I trust you
you didn't make a copy of this?

00:43:00.122 --> 00:43:02.833
I'm assuming you don't want
Struan Loy back.

00:43:03.917 --> 00:43:06.753
Well, you put him
in a very difficult position, Diana.

00:43:06.837 --> 00:43:10.507
Betray me, get back to the Park.
Or don't and be cast into the wilderness.

00:43:10.591 --> 00:43:12.551
He betrayed you, so wilderness.

00:43:12.634 --> 00:43:13.677
Fuck yeah.

00:43:14.761 --> 00:43:16.096
And River Cartwright?

00:43:39.244 --> 00:43:41.622
I'm sorry, but what did you expect?

00:43:41.705 --> 00:43:45.626
Well, Stansted wasn't me.
And we rescued Hassan.

00:43:45.709 --> 00:43:50.881
So… clean slate back at the Park
didn't feel like too much of a stretch.

00:43:50.964 --> 00:43:51.965
So you thought, what?

00:43:52.049 --> 00:43:54.259
Diana Taverner would confess her sins

00:43:54.343 --> 00:43:58.639
in order to benefit your career
while simultaneously destroying her own?

00:43:58.722 --> 00:44:00.390
Tad naive, wouldn't you say?

00:44:00.933 --> 00:44:04.102
Moscow rules, watch your back.
London rules, cover your arse.

00:44:04.186 --> 00:44:05.187
Yeah.

00:44:07.064 --> 00:44:11.652
I seem to have covered her arse,
while she stabbed me straight in the back.

00:44:12.361 --> 00:44:15.822
I will permit one evening
of indulgent self-recrimination,

00:44:15.906 --> 00:44:20.035
which will end when I nod off
after approximately 20 minutes.

00:44:22.120 --> 00:44:23.872
You need to get your head down.

00:44:23.956 --> 00:44:28.877
Keep your nose clean, and then maybe,
just maybe, there's a way back in.

00:44:32.214 --> 00:44:33.549
Oh, come on.

00:44:33.632 --> 00:44:36.343
Even the best spies have
their time in the cold.

00:44:37.511 --> 00:44:40.514
Smiley was always coming back
from redundancy.

00:45:57.966 --> 00:45:59.176
<i>Charles.</i>

00:46:01.178 --> 00:46:03.096
<i>There are things
about Charles Partner's death</i>

00:46:03.180 --> 00:46:04.973
<i>that Lamb hasn't told you.</i>

00:46:22.199 --> 00:46:23.617
What was Taverner going to tell me?

00:46:23.700 --> 00:46:27.329
For fuck's sake. It's-- It's Saturday.

00:46:27.412 --> 00:46:29.748
Haven't you got
other people's cats to steal?

00:46:29.831 --> 00:46:32.417
What aren't you telling me
about Charles's death?

00:46:32.501 --> 00:46:33.502
Nothing.

00:46:34.545 --> 00:46:38.757
I don't believe you.
I should have read the signs. Should I?

00:46:45.931 --> 00:46:47.182
Tell me. What don't I--

00:46:47.266 --> 00:46:48.767
I gave him the gun.

00:46:54.523 --> 00:46:55.524
Why?

00:47:01.113 --> 00:47:02.614
Because he asked for one.

00:47:05.492 --> 00:47:06.577
And he was my friend.

00:47:13.542 --> 00:47:15.627
This was after the Wall came down.

00:47:19.464 --> 00:47:22.259
Cold War scores were being settled.

00:47:23.010 --> 00:47:26.513
And he told me
he'd seen some old, unfriendly faces.

00:47:26.597 --> 00:47:28.098
I thought he was being paranoid,

00:47:28.182 --> 00:47:31.310
but… you know, what if I was wrong,
and he ended--

00:47:37.107 --> 00:47:38.775
Well, it threw my mojo off.

00:47:41.820 --> 00:47:43.572
Put a dent in my armor.

00:47:49.161 --> 00:47:54.833
I-I didn't want to be in the field.
I wanted to be a civilian even less.

00:47:58.587 --> 00:48:02.841
So… this is why I asked for this place.

00:48:06.970 --> 00:48:10.933
Somewhere where I could run out the clock.

00:48:13.268 --> 00:48:15.521
Nothing matters, and no one gets hurt.

00:48:27.157 --> 00:48:29.618
Oh, come on.
One of us has to leave the room now.

00:48:32.621 --> 00:48:34.206
And I'm just too fucking tired.

00:50:34.785 --> 00:50:35.786
Is it done?

00:50:39.831 --> 00:50:40.832
Yeah.

00:50:44.253 --> 00:50:45.879
And so am I.

00:50:46.922 --> 00:50:48.131
If they find out…

00:50:51.593 --> 00:50:54.847
How would they find out, David?
It's just you and me in this car.

00:50:54.930 --> 00:50:57.057
They are rather good at their job.

00:50:59.601 --> 00:51:02.980
Well, I hope for your sake they don't.

00:52:01.371 --> 00:52:04.041
<i>When an agent dies,
everything has to be considered.</i>

00:52:04.124 --> 00:52:07.211
Well, he left a note on his phone.
"Cicada."

00:52:07.794 --> 00:52:10.339
<i>Sleeper agents embedded
in British society.</i>

00:52:10.422 --> 00:52:12.424
We call them dead lions.

00:52:12.508 --> 00:52:14.968
<i>Lamb, I do not need you
digging around in the past.</i>

00:52:15.677 --> 00:52:19.473
<i>Maybe the Cicadas have been reactivated,
and maybe more people are gonna die.</i>

00:52:19.556 --> 00:52:21.225
I'm putting you in the field.

00:52:21.934 --> 00:52:23.769
- What?
- It's exciting.

00:52:26.021 --> 00:52:27.523
Be careful, River.

00:52:27.606 --> 00:52:32.402
The Russians have an incredible capacity
for pain and sacrifice. And grudges.

00:52:33.320 --> 00:52:35.739
<i>We had a traitor right at the top.</i>

00:52:35.822 --> 00:52:37.783
<i>Thousands of people, they're gonna die.</i>

00:52:37.866 --> 00:52:39.868
Paperwork's gonna be a ballache.

00:52:40.452 --> 00:52:43.914
<i>I want the professional humiliation
of you and your team.</i>

00:52:44.998 --> 00:52:47.751
<i>My team have already
humiliated themselves.</i>

00:52:49.253 --> 00:52:51.129
That's why they're my team.
