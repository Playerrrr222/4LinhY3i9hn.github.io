00:00:36.245 --> 00:00:37.579
Finally!

00:00:37.663 --> 00:00:40.249
Couldn't face the idea of black tea.

00:00:40.791 --> 00:00:43.460
You know it's a crime.
It's an absolute fucking crime.

00:00:43.544 --> 00:00:45.671
Mate, I am a thirsty boy.

00:00:45.754 --> 00:00:49.800
No, no. Hang on. Hang on. Not in those.
They're all cold and stewed, aren't they?

00:00:49.883 --> 00:00:51.009
Why'd you leave 'em out then?

00:00:51.093 --> 00:00:53.095
Because I thought you'd be quicker,
didn't I?

00:00:53.178 --> 00:00:54.888
I had to go right down the high street.

00:00:54.972 --> 00:00:58.475
Well, you know there's a corner shop
the other way, you dozy twat.

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.352
Marek wouldn't like that.

00:01:00.435 --> 00:01:01.436
Who's Marek?

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:04.772
Spark we used to work with on the sites.
Polish.

00:01:04.857 --> 00:01:08.277
Milk first and then tea.
How do you English not understand this?

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.612
It makes no difference,
but he'd lose his shit over it.

00:01:10.696 --> 00:01:13.490
Hey. Of course it makes a difference,
you fucking ponce.

00:01:13.574 --> 00:01:16.660
Bag, water, milk, in that fucking order.
Yes?

00:01:16.743 --> 00:01:18.161
A lot of Poles on your sites?

00:01:18.245 --> 00:01:22.541
Poles, Bulgarians, dirty little Romanians,
the lot.

00:01:22.624 --> 00:01:25.252
-Swarming.
-It's like a fucking refugee camp.

00:01:27.129 --> 00:01:28.755
No, hang on. You don't want one, do you?

00:01:28.839 --> 00:01:30.340
Nah. Hair of the dog, mate.

00:01:30.841 --> 00:01:33.468
Well, you must really hate your kidneys.

00:01:33.552 --> 00:01:35.554
Here he is. Sleeping beauty.

00:01:35.637 --> 00:01:37.472
Morning. Sorry, I crashed.

00:01:37.556 --> 00:01:39.808
-Kettle's just boiled if you want one.
-And we have milk.

00:01:39.892 --> 00:01:41.727
-You been out then?
-No, he's lactating.

00:01:43.687 --> 00:01:45.480
Fucking daytime TV.

00:01:46.064 --> 00:01:47.900
I wish we'd brought a PlayStation
or something.

00:01:47.983 --> 00:01:51.195
Hey. I'll tell you what, man.
I am a demon at FIFA.

00:01:51.278 --> 00:01:52.404
-No, you're not.
-Nah.

00:01:52.487 --> 00:01:54.823
Call of Duty, that's the one.
I'd take you all down.

00:01:54.907 --> 00:01:56.200
This isn't a stag weekend.

00:01:56.283 --> 00:01:59.661
Yeah, but you're only saying that because
you're scared that he is gonna beat you.

00:02:00.245 --> 00:02:02.915
You think I'm scared of
an armchair soldier?

00:02:02.998 --> 00:02:04.625
I've done it for real, mate.

00:02:06.043 --> 00:02:07.169
Served my country.

00:02:08.252 --> 00:02:10.255
How many people have you killed?

00:02:12.382 --> 00:02:13.675
You mean in the game, like?

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:15.469
Fuck "in the game." How's that count?

00:02:16.345 --> 00:02:17.638
What's that mean?

00:02:19.431 --> 00:02:21.350
How many people have you killed?

00:02:24.811 --> 00:02:26.438
Well, how many people have you killed?

00:02:26.522 --> 00:02:28.774
Five for sure. They were up close.

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:31.693
Watched the life drain out their eyes.

00:02:32.736 --> 00:02:34.238
Maybe eight, nine more.

00:02:34.905 --> 00:02:36.782
Sometimes you don't stop to count.

00:02:45.541 --> 00:02:46.834
Just hit a million views.

00:02:46.917 --> 00:02:48.168
-Yes.
-Yeah.

00:02:48.252 --> 00:02:50.838
Cooking. I reckon five
will tune in for the main event.

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.091
Anyone check on him?

00:02:54.591 --> 00:02:55.592
Why?

00:02:56.134 --> 00:02:57.719
Just don't hear nothing, that's all.

00:02:57.803 --> 00:03:00.639
Can't fucking talk, can he?
Why do you care so much?

00:03:00.722 --> 00:03:03.016
Well, you wouldn't want him
to have an heart attack, would you?

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:04.560
Might complicate things.

00:03:05.644 --> 00:03:06.812
Fine, I'll go.

00:03:08.522 --> 00:03:10.190
Any love letters
you want me to pass along?

00:03:10.274 --> 00:03:11.275
Fuck off.

00:03:14.528 --> 00:03:15.737
Don't be a ponce.

00:03:19.575 --> 00:03:20.576
Probably.

00:03:37.843 --> 00:03:39.636
I'm gonna take the tape off your mouth.

00:03:40.554 --> 00:03:44.349
But we can hear everything upstairs.

00:03:45.934 --> 00:03:47.936
You need something, ask softly.

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:50.272
You shout for help,
them lights will go from green to red,

00:03:50.355 --> 00:03:53.734
and I'll come down, and I'll kick
your fucking bollocks off. Got it?

00:04:10.292 --> 00:04:11.960
Please, let me go.

00:04:12.044 --> 00:04:15.380
I can't. You're dangerous.

00:04:16.214 --> 00:04:18.341
I've seen what your lot are capable of.

00:04:18.884 --> 00:04:21.386
I left good friends in Afghan
'cause of you.

00:04:22.596 --> 00:04:24.014
So tomorrow morning,

00:04:24.598 --> 00:04:25.599
at sunrise,

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:28.685
you're gonna kneel on the floor there,

00:04:28.769 --> 00:04:30.646
we'll have our camera,

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:33.815
and then-- Well,
you people are the experts, aren't you?

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:36.485
We're gonna cut your head off.

00:05:46.305 --> 00:05:49.975
Is there anything to suggest
we can expect further such attacks

00:05:50.058 --> 00:05:53.604
or is this, in essence, believed to be
an isolated incident?

00:05:55.105 --> 00:05:57.482
This video last night,
in which they made a threat…

00:05:57.566 --> 00:05:58.859
One minute. Thank you.

00:05:58.942 --> 00:06:02.946
…authorities are aware of,
but we have decided not to broadcast.

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:10.746
-Good morning, gentlemen.
-Morning, Diana.

00:06:10.829 --> 00:06:15.167
So this is a fast-moving situation,
so I will update you with what I know.

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:16.502
Should we not wait for Tearney?

00:06:17.211 --> 00:06:19.421
No offense, Diana, but when I relay this
to the Home Secretary--

00:06:19.505 --> 00:06:23.300
I thought you were aware that our
First Desk is in Washington this week.

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:26.345
-I was not aware.
-Ingrid is incredibly busy, Roger.

00:06:26.428 --> 00:06:29.681
As are you. Do you really need to be
across the minutiae of her schedule?

00:06:29.765 --> 00:06:33.644
I'm sure we all know how capable
a Second Desk Diana is. Diana.

00:06:33.727 --> 00:06:35.229
Thank you, Leonard.

00:06:35.938 --> 00:06:39.525
The hostage is Hassan Ahmed.
He was born in Birmingham.

00:06:39.608 --> 00:06:42.110
His grandparents arrived here
in the early '70s.

00:06:42.611 --> 00:06:44.738
He is the youngest of four children.

00:06:44.821 --> 00:06:46.823
He's in his second year
at Leeds University,

00:06:46.907 --> 00:06:48.200
studying business management.

00:06:48.283 --> 00:06:49.993
He shares a flat
with three other students.

00:06:50.077 --> 00:06:51.745
No known girlfriend or boyfriend.

00:06:52.538 --> 00:06:55.541
He's a cricketer. His family are Muslim.

00:06:55.624 --> 00:06:58.418
And before going to university,
he attended the local mosque,

00:06:58.502 --> 00:07:00.546
which is not on any of our watch lists.

00:07:00.629 --> 00:07:04.424
He no longer appears to attend,
but his family still go.

00:07:04.508 --> 00:07:07.344
In short, he is nothing other
than what he appears to be.

00:07:07.427 --> 00:07:10.222
A law-abiding, British-Asian student.

00:07:11.682 --> 00:07:14.017
The kidnappers call themselves
the Sons of Albion.

00:07:14.101 --> 00:07:15.686
They've been on our radar
for about a year,

00:07:15.769 --> 00:07:19.273
and there have been murmurs that
something like this was on the horizon.

00:07:19.356 --> 00:07:24.152
Point of order. Murmurs and horizons
are so vague as to seem unhelpful, Diana.

00:07:24.653 --> 00:07:25.654
Sources and methods, Roger.

00:07:25.737 --> 00:07:29.157
Outside of the sphere of this committee,
Roger. You know that.

00:07:29.241 --> 00:07:32.327
-We monitor results, not process.
-And do you have a source in the group?

00:07:32.411 --> 00:07:33.954
That would fall under process.

00:07:34.037 --> 00:07:38.041
What I can say is that
there are 17 such right-wing groups

00:07:38.125 --> 00:07:39.585
on our radar right now.

00:07:40.210 --> 00:07:42.171
We've been saying for some time
that with more resources,

00:07:42.254 --> 00:07:43.964
we could have them all
under proper surveillance

00:07:44.047 --> 00:07:46.550
and stop this kind of thing
from getting off the ground.

00:07:46.633 --> 00:07:47.926
The Home Office will back you.

00:07:48.635 --> 00:07:51.889
But the Treasury may add that you've
already had a considerable increase,

00:07:51.972 --> 00:07:53.390
with little increase in results.

00:07:53.473 --> 00:07:56.435
We have had an increase
to monitor jihadi groups.

00:07:57.186 --> 00:08:00.606
Unfortunately, we were looking one way
when we should have been looking both.

00:08:01.231 --> 00:08:02.566
He's landed, ma'am.

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:06.445
Gentlemen, I need to be somewhere else.
I'm sure you'll understand.

00:08:12.034 --> 00:08:15.954
And immediately after that, I'll need
to contact the Pakistani ambassador.

00:08:16.997 --> 00:08:19.791
It appears this wasn't
the random snatch we thought.

00:08:34.806 --> 00:08:38.352
There's no sign of Cartwright,
and he's not answering his phone.

00:08:44.149 --> 00:08:45.150
What's wrong?

00:08:45.234 --> 00:08:48.237
The fact that you're still here
talking to me, for starters.

00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:50.447
No, it's mid-morning,
and you haven't had a drink yet.

00:08:51.114 --> 00:08:54.952
Why, in the old days you'd be
on your third stomach pump by now.

00:08:55.827 --> 00:08:58.372
That's your first taunt of the morning.
You're slipping.

00:08:58.455 --> 00:09:00.082
Something's definitely up.

00:09:01.041 --> 00:09:05.462
It's a bit late for getting good
at spotting your boss's moods.

00:09:07.005 --> 00:09:08.006
This shouldn't be in here.

00:09:09.716 --> 00:09:12.594
When Cartwright comes back,
tie him to his desk by his bollocks.

00:09:12.678 --> 00:09:16.849
I want my people in here, doing nothing.

00:09:47.421 --> 00:09:48.422
Geez.

00:09:49.506 --> 00:09:50.591
Christ.

00:09:51.842 --> 00:09:55.345
Do you do that thing here
where you burn ear hair out,

00:09:55.429 --> 00:09:58.223
because that is definitely
where I'd focus next.

00:09:58.307 --> 00:10:00.309
That is-- That's a two-week job, that.

00:10:00.392 --> 00:10:01.393
Envy.

00:10:02.352 --> 00:10:05.147
Can't afford places like this
on a Slough House salary, can you, River?

00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:07.941
No, that's true. But then again, I don't
need to come to a place like this.

00:10:08.025 --> 00:10:10.652
-I've learned how to shave myself.
-Then you don't need to be here, do you?

00:10:10.736 --> 00:10:14.198
No, I do, because I want to know
what was on Hobden's USB stick.

00:10:16.074 --> 00:10:17.701
-Gino, I need a moment.
-Of course, sir.

00:10:17.784 --> 00:10:18.785
Thanks.

00:10:22.414 --> 00:10:24.499
What the fuck are you playing at?
That's classified.

00:10:24.583 --> 00:10:26.335
Is it something to do with the kidnapping?

00:10:26.418 --> 00:10:28.837
I refer you to my previous answer.

00:10:29.463 --> 00:10:32.841
Okay, look, I get it.
We're just slow horses. We're grunts.

00:10:33.467 --> 00:10:36.053
It's just good to get feedback
when we've done a nice job.

00:10:36.929 --> 00:10:39.765
Of course you didn't do a good job.
You're slow fucking horses.

00:10:41.892 --> 00:10:43.060
Thank you.

00:10:43.143 --> 00:10:44.269
For what?

00:10:44.353 --> 00:10:46.730
For letting me know
there's nothing useful on the stick.

00:10:46.813 --> 00:10:49.525
-No, I didn't. I didn't.
-Yes, you did. Yes, you did.

00:10:49.608 --> 00:10:52.945
And besides, to me it looked like it was
just pi to a million decimal points.

00:10:53.028 --> 00:10:55.405
You twat! You looked at it!

00:10:55.489 --> 00:10:56.990
Have fun with Sweeney Todd.

00:11:09.294 --> 00:11:10.379
Charles?

00:11:13.966 --> 00:11:15.759
Morning, Charles.

00:11:16.677 --> 00:11:17.678
Charles.

00:11:18.762 --> 00:11:19.763
Charles?

00:11:19.847 --> 00:11:21.348
He's in the bath.

00:11:22.724 --> 00:11:23.851
You are?

00:11:26.895 --> 00:11:27.896
Lamb.

00:11:28.897 --> 00:11:32.276
Morning, Catherine. Think I heard you
shouting about breakfast.

00:11:35.737 --> 00:11:36.738
Jackson.

00:11:38.115 --> 00:11:39.700
I thought you were in Berlin.

00:11:39.783 --> 00:11:41.368
Berlin's blown.

00:11:51.545 --> 00:11:55.299
Steve, there have been
no further statements from the kidnappers

00:11:55.382 --> 00:11:57.509
since their initial broadcast threats.

00:11:57.593 --> 00:12:00.804
Are we any closer
to identifying the man being held?

00:12:01.388 --> 00:12:06.268
My understanding is that the security
services have now confirmed his identity,

00:12:06.351 --> 00:12:08.061
but are not releasing it to the media.

00:12:08.854 --> 00:12:09.938
Catherine, how goes it?

00:12:10.022 --> 00:12:11.398
It goes.

00:12:11.481 --> 00:12:15.360
I wondered if you might wish to partake
of some charity. Raffle tickets.

00:12:15.444 --> 00:12:17.529
It's for a good cause.
It's my daughter's school.

00:12:17.613 --> 00:12:18.739
My purse is upstairs.

00:12:18.822 --> 00:12:24.203
I trust you. It's four for a fiver,
but ten for a tenner.

00:12:24.286 --> 00:12:26.413
-Just four.
-No. You'll want to go to ten.

00:12:26.496 --> 00:12:28.290
First prize is a spa day.

00:12:28.373 --> 00:12:30.250
-You wouldn't want to miss out on that.
-Four.

00:12:35.631 --> 00:12:38.300
-Check something for me.
-On the clock, yeah?

00:12:38.383 --> 00:12:39.384
River.

00:12:40.302 --> 00:12:41.303
Catherine.

00:12:42.387 --> 00:12:43.597
Where were you?

00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:45.182
Just getting some air.

00:12:45.849 --> 00:12:47.309
We have air in here.

00:12:47.392 --> 00:12:50.103
Yeah, well, it's pretty fetid.

00:12:51.438 --> 00:12:53.190
Lamb wants everyone at their desks.

00:12:53.273 --> 00:12:56.944
Sure, yeah. I've just--
I've got a bit of an IT issue

00:12:57.027 --> 00:13:01.198
that Roddy is helping me with.
My emails aren't syncing.

00:13:02.616 --> 00:13:05.202
Well, back to your station,
once that's done.

00:13:06.328 --> 00:13:07.329
Where's Moody?

00:13:07.412 --> 00:13:10.499
-I'm not his--
-Bitch. Yes, got it.

00:13:24.221 --> 00:13:26.640
Right. So, can you get
into Hobden's emails?

00:13:26.723 --> 00:13:29.560
Of course I can. Question is, why would I?

00:13:30.644 --> 00:13:32.855
Because you might help
to save that boy's life.

00:13:32.938 --> 00:13:34.731
Yeah, but I don't know that kid.

00:13:34.815 --> 00:13:38.318
And it's not like the Park will give us
a bonus or a medal for helping out. So…

00:13:38.402 --> 00:13:40.112
Oh, Roddy, Roddy, Roddy.

00:13:40.696 --> 00:13:42.865
Why exactly did you join
the service again, Roddy?

00:13:42.948 --> 00:13:46.368
Because the service wanted me
inside the tent, pissing out.

00:13:48.537 --> 00:13:52.291
This is a bigger ask than checking
a USB stick. Money won't cut it.

00:13:52.374 --> 00:13:55.002
Okay. Well,

00:13:55.794 --> 00:13:58.422
maybe do it
because I have something that you want.

00:14:00.132 --> 00:14:01.967
I know why you're in Slough House.

00:14:02.968 --> 00:14:04.261
No, you don't.

00:14:04.887 --> 00:14:06.180
Yes, I do.

00:14:06.263 --> 00:14:07.264
Impossible.

00:14:07.764 --> 00:14:11.143
The answer to that conundrum
has eluded the finest mind in MI5.

00:14:11.226 --> 00:14:13.979
And the finest mind being you?

00:14:14.062 --> 00:14:15.355
-Right. Of course.
-Yeah.

00:14:15.939 --> 00:14:20.569
Yeah. And if I can't crack that puzzle,
how could you?

00:14:23.071 --> 00:14:26.366
Because you don't have a grandfather
who used to be high-up in the service.

00:14:30.078 --> 00:14:31.496
You better not be bluffing.

00:14:31.580 --> 00:14:33.999
Yeah, 'cause I'm gonna try and bluff you.

00:14:34.082 --> 00:14:37.002
You're Roddy, McRodster, the Hot Rod.

00:14:37.586 --> 00:14:40.214
-You could take me apart online. Come on.
-Take you apart in a way

00:14:40.297 --> 00:14:41.965
-no one could put you back together.
-I know.

00:14:42.549 --> 00:14:43.884
It scares me.

00:14:44.885 --> 00:14:46.261
It should only take a few seconds.

00:14:46.345 --> 00:14:47.888
Good, man.

00:14:47.971 --> 00:14:51.892
My fingers are weapons.
My thumb is more powerful than Nero's.

00:14:51.975 --> 00:14:53.519
Did he have a strong thumb, did he?

00:14:53.602 --> 00:14:56.146
Thumb up or thumb down determined
whether you lived or died in the arena.

00:14:56.230 --> 00:14:58.857
-Right, I didn't know that.
-And in the online arena,

00:14:58.941 --> 00:15:01.610
I am somewhere
between an emperor and a god.

00:15:08.659 --> 00:15:09.660
Yeah, I can't do it.

00:15:10.244 --> 00:15:12.204
You just claimed to be a god, Roddy.

00:15:12.287 --> 00:15:14.164
Well, even gods have blind spots.

00:15:14.248 --> 00:15:16.250
What's the blind spot?

00:15:16.333 --> 00:15:17.626
He's air gapped.

00:15:17.709 --> 00:15:18.836
Right. What's "air gapped"?

00:15:20.254 --> 00:15:21.338
He's not online.

00:15:21.421 --> 00:15:23.715
Right. So he has to be online
for you to hack his emails?

00:15:23.799 --> 00:15:27.135
No, he doesn't use emails.
He's got no online presence at all.

00:15:27.219 --> 00:15:29.179
Nothing in the cloud, no social media.

00:15:29.721 --> 00:15:32.349
He's old-school. He's keeping it analog.

00:15:33.058 --> 00:15:34.142
Keeping it real.

00:15:34.226 --> 00:15:36.061
Right. I know for a fact
he's got a computer.

00:15:36.144 --> 00:15:40.148
He can have a computer, but he doesn't
send email or back it up online.

00:15:41.149 --> 00:15:44.862
Right, so the only way to find out what's
on his laptop is to grab his laptop.

00:15:44.945 --> 00:15:46.238
-Yeah.
-Right, cool.

00:15:46.321 --> 00:15:47.781
Yeah, but you'd have to be quick about it.

00:15:47.865 --> 00:15:50.701
A guy that security conscious
probably has a thermite pot.

00:15:51.326 --> 00:15:52.369
All right, what's that?

00:15:52.911 --> 00:15:54.621
It's a pot filled with thermite.

00:15:54.705 --> 00:15:55.873
Yes, I got that bit.

00:15:56.623 --> 00:15:59.960
Thermite's made up of aluminium,
iron oxide and a thin strip of magnesium.

00:16:00.043 --> 00:16:02.504
You stick it in a clay pot,
set it on top of your laptop or desktop,

00:16:02.588 --> 00:16:04.214
pigs kick the door down,
you ignite the strip,

00:16:04.298 --> 00:16:05.799
mix burns through the hard drive.

00:16:08.844 --> 00:16:10.512
You know that technically we're the pigs.

00:16:10.596 --> 00:16:13.473
I'm from the streets.
Sometimes I talk street.

00:16:14.641 --> 00:16:16.310
-Okay. Thanks, Roddy.
-Hey!

00:16:16.393 --> 00:16:18.812
You're supposed to tell me why I'm here.

00:16:20.189 --> 00:16:23.150
Well, deal was you got me
into Hobden's emails, and you didn't.

00:16:23.233 --> 00:16:25.235
So, next time.

00:16:27.487 --> 00:16:28.697
Fair play.

00:16:41.793 --> 00:16:42.794
River's back.

00:16:44.171 --> 00:16:45.547
Where was he?

00:16:45.631 --> 00:16:48.133
He said he went out for some air.
I didn't push it.

00:16:48.217 --> 00:16:50.511
The rest are accounted for, except Moody.

00:16:52.596 --> 00:16:55.682
You're not just worried
about River though, are you?

00:16:58.227 --> 00:17:02.314
Do you think it's a coincidence
that Diana Taverner

00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:06.693
ran a special op on a right-wing reject

00:17:06.777 --> 00:17:10.571
just as some prick nationalists

00:17:10.656 --> 00:17:12.491
kidnapped a brown kid?

00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:17.329
-Well--
-That was rhetorical.

00:17:26.505 --> 00:17:29.925
I can also tell you
that a multi-agency response

00:17:30.008 --> 00:17:31.635
is being coordinated, involving…

00:17:31.718 --> 00:17:34.805
The kidnappers
have threatened to execute him,

00:17:34.888 --> 00:17:38.725
with the authorities no closer
to identifying his location.

00:17:39.768 --> 00:17:43.230
The number of views of the video
now stands at one million,

00:17:43.313 --> 00:17:45.816
and this figure is rising rapidly.

00:17:45.899 --> 00:17:48.026
We're due to hear shortly
from a spokesperson

00:17:48.110 --> 00:17:51.321
from the Metropolitan Police's
counter-terrorism unit

00:17:51.405 --> 00:17:52.948
on their response to the video.

00:18:01.957 --> 00:18:04.334
I keep checking the news,
but there's no actual news.

00:18:04.418 --> 00:18:06.628
Yeah, well, the Park
will have imposed a blackout.

00:18:06.712 --> 00:18:07.713
Yeah, I know.

00:18:09.047 --> 00:18:11.675
You sorting that into recycling piles or…

00:18:15.596 --> 00:18:16.680
Where'd you go earlier?

00:18:17.306 --> 00:18:20.309
I wanted to find out if what you
downloaded from Hobden's USB stick

00:18:20.392 --> 00:18:21.852
was what the Park was looking for.

00:18:23.228 --> 00:18:24.438
But it wasn't.

00:18:25.230 --> 00:18:27.274
Think you'll find
what they were looking for in there?

00:18:38.702 --> 00:18:40.370
You don't wanna know what I'm doing.

00:18:40.454 --> 00:18:42.039
Probably get me kicked out for good.

00:18:42.122 --> 00:18:43.707
River, is it really worth it?

00:18:43.790 --> 00:18:45.792
I can't just sit around
and do nothing, Sid.

00:18:47.127 --> 00:18:49.296
I've got one lead,
and yes, it might be bullshit.

00:18:49.379 --> 00:18:51.340
But I have to follow it.
Otherwise, what good am I?

00:18:53.091 --> 00:18:55.886
I will clean that up. I promise.
Just don't let anyone touch it.

00:19:17.783 --> 00:19:18.992
Ma'am.

00:19:19.076 --> 00:19:22.788
Mr. Moody. Sit down quickly.
You've seen the news. I'm rather pressed.

00:19:24.706 --> 00:19:27.042
You bothered my head of security
last night.

00:19:27.125 --> 00:19:28.210
Yeah, well, he's an old friend.

00:19:29.002 --> 00:19:30.003
Well, I'm sure he is.

00:19:30.504 --> 00:19:32.589
You told him Jackson Lamb
is running an op.

00:19:33.966 --> 00:19:35.259
Duffy said he knew all about it.

00:19:35.342 --> 00:19:38.887
But I knew he was bluffing 'cause he
didn't know that Sid Baker's a girl.

00:19:38.971 --> 00:19:41.807
She's a woman and twice the agent you are.

00:19:43.141 --> 00:19:44.643
I spent six years as a Dog.

00:19:44.726 --> 00:19:46.186
For God's sake, do shut up.

00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:49.648
What I want to know is,
how did you find out about it?

00:19:51.233 --> 00:19:52.484
About what, ma'am?

00:19:52.568 --> 00:19:55.362
You're mistaking this for a conversation.

00:19:55.445 --> 00:19:58.365
When I ask for information, you give it.

00:19:58.866 --> 00:20:00.409
Don't play dumb.

00:20:00.492 --> 00:20:02.452
Don't lie. Clear?

00:20:05.038 --> 00:20:08.125
I gave Lamb a specific instruction.
Why were you in on the loop?

00:20:08.959 --> 00:20:11.044
Doesn't respect you.
Wouldn't confide in you.

00:20:13.589 --> 00:20:15.424
Do you remember the bit about not lying?

00:20:17.926 --> 00:20:18.927
There's a bug.

00:20:20.888 --> 00:20:23.682
Are you seriously telling me you planted
a bug in Jackson Lamb's office?

00:20:23.765 --> 00:20:25.475
-I never trusted that lazy bastard.
-Jesus Christ.

00:20:25.559 --> 00:20:28.353
-It's not like it was a personal thing.
-Why didn't the sweeps pick it up?

00:20:29.271 --> 00:20:32.566
Don't tell me you do the sweeping.
Jesus Christ.

00:20:33.483 --> 00:20:36.069
What else do you lot get up to
over there in toy town?

00:20:36.153 --> 00:20:38.780
I guess it was force of habit.
I used to be one of the Dogs.

00:20:38.864 --> 00:20:40.157
Really? You didn't mention that.

00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:43.702
And he doesn't give me anything to do.
Or at least anything that matters.

00:20:44.369 --> 00:20:46.079
He's just taking the piss.

00:20:46.163 --> 00:20:48.749
So I wanted to see if I could get
anything on him, and I have.

00:20:48.832 --> 00:20:50.334
The burnt-out twat.

00:20:50.417 --> 00:20:52.669
If he ever wants to get out,
I know exactly how he'll do it.

00:20:52.753 --> 00:20:55.130
I know where he'll go and under what name.

00:20:59.009 --> 00:21:00.093
Here's what's gonna happen.

00:21:00.177 --> 00:21:03.055
You are going to do me a couple of favors
off the record,

00:21:03.138 --> 00:21:06.058
which means that if anything
goes even slightly wrong,

00:21:06.141 --> 00:21:07.351
I'll have never have heard of you.

00:21:07.434 --> 00:21:08.560
Understood?

00:21:09.478 --> 00:21:11.563
Incoming only. And dump the bug.

00:21:11.647 --> 00:21:13.899
Slough House may be a dead end,
but it's part of the service.

00:21:13.982 --> 00:21:15.901
If it gets out it's been compromised,

00:21:15.984 --> 00:21:19.154
your former chums in the Dogs
will tear you apart.

00:21:19.821 --> 00:21:23.617
And, Moody, a word of warning.
Lamb's a burnout for a reason.

00:21:23.700 --> 00:21:27.204
When he was in the field, he had more
to worry about than screwups like you.

00:21:27.746 --> 00:21:31.583
He risked being caught,
tortured and shot, and he survived.

00:21:31.667 --> 00:21:32.876
Might want to bear that in mind.

00:21:35.170 --> 00:21:39.091
Well, I'm joined now by our home security
correspondent Derek Rothery.

00:21:39.174 --> 00:21:42.845
What can you tell us
about the investigation so far?

00:21:42.928 --> 00:21:47.724
West Yorkshire police have now confirmed
they're involved in the investigation.

00:21:47.808 --> 00:21:49.351
-This follows contact…
-Turn it down.

00:21:49.434 --> 00:21:50.602
…with Hassan Ahmed's family.

00:21:50.686 --> 00:21:52.980
Just the same shit over and over again.

00:21:53.063 --> 00:21:55.649
This is our big moment.
We've got the whole world looking for us.

00:21:55.732 --> 00:21:58.443
Do we have any information
on why Mr. Ahmed might have been taken?

00:21:58.527 --> 00:22:00.362
-Fucking--
-We don't. Now, it might be…

00:22:00.445 --> 00:22:03.156
You know you can't say a word
about this once it's done, yeah?

00:22:04.074 --> 00:22:06.326
We never knew each other.
We were never here.

00:22:06.410 --> 00:22:07.411
Yeah.

00:22:07.494 --> 00:22:09.580
-Please.
-Yeah, I'm proud of what we're doing

00:22:09.663 --> 00:22:11.373
-for our country.
-I need the toilet.

00:22:11.456 --> 00:22:13.667
-But I won't say nothing.
-No, you won't.

00:22:13.750 --> 00:22:15.210
'Cause if you do, I'll fucking find you.

00:22:17.171 --> 00:22:18.714
Look, I-I really need to go.

00:22:22.384 --> 00:22:23.677
Let him shit himself.

00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:25.262
-Hey, tell you what.
-Hello?

00:22:25.345 --> 00:22:26.972
He'll be shitting himself in the morning.

00:22:27.055 --> 00:22:28.599
-Please.
-I'll take him to the toilet.

00:22:28.682 --> 00:22:30.309
Just now,
you were getting off on the world

00:22:30.392 --> 00:22:31.894
-wanting to know who we are.
-I really need…

00:22:31.977 --> 00:22:34.188
You want them to know
you leapt up to wipe a Muslim's arse?

00:22:34.271 --> 00:22:35.272
I didn't leap up.

00:22:35.355 --> 00:22:37.149
Go find a bucket or summat.

00:22:37.232 --> 00:22:38.984
He's not using our toilet.

00:22:40.152 --> 00:22:41.153
Go on.

00:23:19.900 --> 00:23:21.026
Where is it then?

00:23:21.109 --> 00:23:22.236
Couldn't find a bucket.

00:23:23.320 --> 00:23:25.697
I think there's a bucket
in the back garden, you know?

00:23:27.366 --> 00:23:30.035
We don't know if this individual
was a person

00:23:30.118 --> 00:23:31.828
known to the police
or the security guards.

00:23:31.912 --> 00:23:34.581
-I'll do it then, shall I?
-But it is quite usual

00:23:34.665 --> 00:23:37.334
in terror-related incidents
for the authorities

00:23:37.417 --> 00:23:41.004
to refrain from sharing information
which they think might jeopardize the…

00:23:45.133 --> 00:23:48.971
But there is a significant police
presence in the area today, which…

00:23:49.054 --> 00:23:50.222
How was he, ma'am?

00:23:50.305 --> 00:23:53.267
If you're talking about Mr. Moody,
it's between him and me.

00:23:53.350 --> 00:23:55.936
Pakistani ambassador was not best pleased.

00:23:56.019 --> 00:23:57.437
I hear there's been a breakthrough.

00:23:57.521 --> 00:24:00.858
Well, not quite a breakthrough, ma'am,
but we think he's being held in London.

00:24:00.941 --> 00:24:03.777
-Because?
-It's London brick, in the basement.

00:24:03.861 --> 00:24:06.488
We presume it's a basement.
No light, bare walls.

00:24:06.572 --> 00:24:08.448
-Built in London brick?
-Yeah.

00:24:08.532 --> 00:24:11.535
So you've narrowed it down to one
in three and a half million houses.

00:24:11.618 --> 00:24:13.370
No, no. Lower than that.

00:24:13.453 --> 00:24:17.457
See, the age and style of the pointing
means we can limit it to certain areas.

00:24:17.541 --> 00:24:19.626
Victorian, before the mass expansion.

00:24:21.420 --> 00:24:24.298
Well, keep going.
I want an address, not a census.

00:24:24.923 --> 00:24:26.383
Anything new on the feed?

00:24:26.466 --> 00:24:30.637
What they did with the original upload
was a quite sophisticated bounce back,

00:24:30.721 --> 00:24:32.848
and the live feed's off-line now.

00:24:33.515 --> 00:24:35.893
When they come back online,
it will be to execute him.

00:24:35.976 --> 00:24:37.811
So find out
where they're broadcasting from.

00:24:37.895 --> 00:24:39.479
I need to update the Foreign Office,

00:24:39.563 --> 00:24:41.523
and I want you to run through
all the extraction options.

00:24:41.607 --> 00:24:43.901
-Yes, ma'am.
-No one goes home,

00:24:43.984 --> 00:24:46.737
and anyone home on leave,
you pull them straight back.

00:25:00.584 --> 00:25:01.919
You can use that.

00:25:03.670 --> 00:25:05.672
-Oh, no.
-Relax.

00:25:05.756 --> 00:25:08.133
Choppy choppy
isn't until tomorrow morning.

00:25:08.717 --> 00:25:12.012
-And then we fight back for our country.
-I'm British.

00:25:12.095 --> 00:25:14.056
What?
'Cause you passed the citizenship test?

00:25:14.139 --> 00:25:16.308
No, no, no. I was born here just like you.

00:25:16.391 --> 00:25:18.060
-My family moved--
-It's not the same.

00:25:18.143 --> 00:25:22.105
Jesus was born in a stable.
That don't make him a fucking donkey. Up.

00:25:26.652 --> 00:25:27.986
Hands together.

00:25:32.991 --> 00:25:34.576
Listen, please.

00:25:35.577 --> 00:25:36.662
Feet together.

00:25:39.039 --> 00:25:40.666
Don't you fucking move!

00:25:43.961 --> 00:25:45.212
There you go.

00:25:46.547 --> 00:25:48.173
You can use your toilet whenever you like.

00:25:52.761 --> 00:25:54.805
You think Churchill would be proud
of what you're doing?

00:25:54.888 --> 00:25:55.889
You what?

00:25:57.099 --> 00:25:58.517
Beheading me in cold blood.

00:25:59.434 --> 00:26:00.435
You're a coward.

00:26:01.728 --> 00:26:03.564
You wanna talk about cowardice?

00:26:04.940 --> 00:26:06.692
You can't even go on a pub stage.

00:26:07.985 --> 00:26:09.236
Was that your dream?

00:26:09.903 --> 00:26:11.321
Well, it's too late now.

00:26:14.741 --> 00:26:15.742
Boo!

00:26:22.749 --> 00:26:24.168
Fuck's sake.

00:26:33.468 --> 00:26:35.762
It's Robert Hobden for Nick Drew.

00:26:36.597 --> 00:26:38.849
Well, when did he leave? No, never mind.

00:26:38.932 --> 00:26:41.476
Can you just put me through
to whoever's on the news desk?

00:26:43.395 --> 00:26:45.397
I'm sorry, I can't leave a number.

00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:46.815
I'll call back.

00:26:48.192 --> 00:26:50.194
Hello, it's Robert Hobden again.

00:26:50.277 --> 00:26:52.696
Is Kate Draper out of her meeting yet?

00:26:53.322 --> 00:26:55.699
It's a bloody long meeting.

00:26:57.659 --> 00:26:59.244
It's a different meeting, is it?

00:27:03.790 --> 00:27:05.751
It's Robert Hobden for Peter Judd.

00:27:06.710 --> 00:27:08.962
No, well, then I'll call again. And again.

00:27:24.811 --> 00:27:26.647
Hey, your change.

00:27:27.272 --> 00:27:29.733
Five years, and he's never left a tip.

00:27:30.317 --> 00:27:31.902
Well, it's your lucky day.

00:30:26.326 --> 00:30:27.327
Standish!

00:30:38.547 --> 00:30:41.550
Yeah, I'd hang back if I were you. God.

00:30:41.633 --> 00:30:44.428
I have just let one rip.

00:30:44.511 --> 00:30:46.221
It's a killer.

00:30:49.683 --> 00:30:51.185
Get me Taverner on the phone.

00:30:51.727 --> 00:30:55.480
Catherine, you said later.
And later it now is.

00:30:56.023 --> 00:30:57.274
Give me a minute.

00:31:01.320 --> 00:31:02.321
Boss man?

00:31:03.071 --> 00:31:04.656
Piss off.

00:31:05.616 --> 00:31:07.284
Will do, shortly.

00:31:07.367 --> 00:31:09.912
After I've collected tax
from Ms. Standish.

00:31:11.997 --> 00:31:13.207
Connecting you now.

00:31:13.916 --> 00:31:15.751
Dickhead, I have a call.

00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:17.961
Diana?

00:31:19.421 --> 00:31:22.299
Who? Who the fuck are you?

00:31:22.382 --> 00:31:25.802
Well, if she can't come to the phone,
take the fucking phone to her.

00:31:25.886 --> 00:31:28.222
-You went for ten after all.
-Yeah.

00:31:28.305 --> 00:31:30.098
The message is,

00:31:30.182 --> 00:31:34.269
"Call me urgently.
I have the results of your test."

00:31:34.353 --> 00:31:36.980
Makes up for River leaving early
without a purchase.

00:31:37.064 --> 00:31:38.899
Yeah. Just get her to fucking call me.

00:31:40.150 --> 00:31:42.236
When exactly did Cartwright leave?

00:31:42.903 --> 00:31:46.323
I don't know exactly. About two hours ago?

00:31:46.406 --> 00:31:47.533
Just before Sid.

00:31:47.616 --> 00:31:50.077
All right. Well, fuck off.

00:32:04.591 --> 00:32:06.218
Jesus, this time tomorrow morning.

00:32:07.094 --> 00:32:09.054
Yeah, we'll be back here.

00:32:09.137 --> 00:32:13.058
Same shit, different--
You mean the hostage.

00:32:13.141 --> 00:32:16.353
Of course, well,
they'll find him before then, won't they?

00:32:16.436 --> 00:32:17.980
I mean, they have to.

00:32:18.063 --> 00:32:19.356
Yeah, let's hope so.

00:32:20.858 --> 00:32:22.568
You doing anything tonight?

00:32:22.651 --> 00:32:24.152
I'm praying for a lottery win.

00:32:25.696 --> 00:32:28.740
But I mean, that's not, you know,
necessarily location specific.

00:32:28.824 --> 00:32:30.784
I could do that on the move.

00:32:31.410 --> 00:32:35.497
Hey, you two flakies.
You forgetting we have a date tonight?

00:32:37.541 --> 00:32:40.752
Shit. Sorry, Struan, I've double-booked.

00:32:40.836 --> 00:32:42.796
I'm meeting a friend tonight now. Sorry.

00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:47.092
You met a friend last night too.
It's good to be popular. Min?

00:32:47.968 --> 00:32:50.220
Clare's texted.
Her sister's having a mare.

00:32:50.304 --> 00:32:52.306
Splitting up with her boyfriend.

00:32:52.389 --> 00:32:55.309
So, yeah, I'm on full-on dad duty tonight.

00:32:56.268 --> 00:33:00.189
Very well. We had such a laugh
last time we went for a drink.

00:33:00.689 --> 00:33:02.316
We must do it again at some point.

00:33:02.399 --> 00:33:03.400
Absolutely.

00:33:03.483 --> 00:33:04.776
Let's do Christmas drinks.

00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:06.570
It's February.

00:33:42.397 --> 00:33:43.815
What the hell are you doing here?

00:33:43.899 --> 00:33:45.150
I could ask you the same thing.

00:33:45.734 --> 00:33:46.902
Thought you might want a coffee.

00:33:46.985 --> 00:33:48.445
You didn't have any in the café.

00:33:49.696 --> 00:33:51.073
Sorry, have you been following me?

00:33:51.573 --> 00:33:52.950
You'd better hope not.

00:33:53.033 --> 00:33:55.369
Because that'd mean I tracked you halfway
across London without you noticing.

00:33:55.452 --> 00:33:57.287
-Jesus Christ.
-I thought you were good at this.

00:33:57.371 --> 00:34:00.541
Maybe that story about you
tailing Taverner is just a myth.

00:34:00.624 --> 00:34:03.877
That-- No. Not a myth, actually.
That really did happen.

00:34:08.632 --> 00:34:12.844
I was assigned to follow the Shadow
Minister for Education as an exercise.

00:34:12.928 --> 00:34:14.638
But then he had a heart attack
the night before.

00:34:14.721 --> 00:34:17.641
So I followed Taverner instead.

00:34:17.724 --> 00:34:20.018
And I watched her do everything.
Everything.

00:34:20.101 --> 00:34:23.647
Gym, breakfast, office,
gym again at lunch.

00:34:24.606 --> 00:34:26.567
I got within 10 feet and she never knew.

00:34:27.150 --> 00:34:30.737
Well, not until I showed her
the photographs the next day.

00:34:30.821 --> 00:34:32.864
And that bit about her applauding you?

00:34:33.614 --> 00:34:36.409
People have made more of that than
it warranted. It was just three claps.

00:34:36.493 --> 00:34:39.371
You should be applauding me. I kept an eye
on Hobden while you went to get your car.

00:34:39.454 --> 00:34:40.539
I should be applau--

00:34:41.623 --> 00:34:43.833
I would have stuck out,
standing around on the street.

00:34:43.917 --> 00:34:44.960
Well, I didn't.

00:34:45.043 --> 00:34:48.338
But then, as we've established,
I am better at surveillance than you.

00:34:48.422 --> 00:34:51.216
That's just-- Depends how you look at it.

00:34:51.717 --> 00:34:52.717
Come on.

00:34:53.510 --> 00:34:54.844
Unbelievable.

00:34:54.928 --> 00:34:56.513
You love it when I'm hard on you.

00:35:00.601 --> 00:35:03.812
So, what did you find in Hobden's rubbish
that put you in spy mode?

00:35:05.439 --> 00:35:08.984
Ho predicted that Hobden would've made
something called a thermite pot,

00:35:09.943 --> 00:35:12.905
which is basically a geek way
for the clinically paranoid

00:35:12.988 --> 00:35:14.364
to burn the computer to ash.

00:35:14.865 --> 00:35:19.620
And I found some steel wool
and rusting coffee filters in his rubbish.

00:35:20.204 --> 00:35:23.957
He'd been making iron oxide.
It's one of the ingredients for thermite.

00:35:24.541 --> 00:35:27.336
So he's got something on his hard drive
he doesn't want anyone to find?

00:35:31.298 --> 00:35:32.299
That is disgusting.

00:35:32.382 --> 00:35:33.967
That'd be the arsenic.

00:35:35.636 --> 00:35:36.595
How'd you get Ho to help?

00:35:38.847 --> 00:35:40.974
I promised I'd tell him
why he's in Slough House.

00:35:41.058 --> 00:35:44.186
-Do you know?
-I do, yeah. Do you?

00:35:45.479 --> 00:35:47.648
Well, anyway,
he couldn't do what I asked him,

00:35:47.731 --> 00:35:50.317
which was to hack into Hobden's email,
so I didn't have to tell him.

00:35:50.901 --> 00:35:51.944
Would you have told him?

00:35:52.027 --> 00:35:53.612
Yeah, he wants to know.

00:35:53.695 --> 00:35:56.198
-How would you have told him?
-I don't know. With words.

00:35:57.282 --> 00:36:01.078
Okay. Pretend I'm Roddy Ho,
and you tell me that the reason

00:36:01.161 --> 00:36:04.915
I've been shipped out to Slough House
is because I'm an insufferable prick.

00:36:04.998 --> 00:36:06.083
-I got moved…
-I'd sugarcoat it.

00:36:06.166 --> 00:36:09.461
…from every department I worked in in MI5
and Slough House was the only place left.

00:36:09.545 --> 00:36:11.088
But if he had gotten me
into Hobden's emails,

00:36:11.171 --> 00:36:13.215
-can we agree that would've been useful?
-That--

00:36:13.298 --> 00:36:14.967
He once put someone
on the sex offenders register

00:36:15.050 --> 00:36:16.593
because they nicked his seat on a bus.

00:36:16.677 --> 00:36:17.719
I didn't have to tell him.

00:36:17.803 --> 00:36:19.930
-Imagine what he'd do to you.
-So why are we arguing about this?

00:36:23.016 --> 00:36:27.020
Do you think Roddy could find out
why Lamb is in Slough House?

00:36:27.104 --> 00:36:29.356
No. Otherwise he would've already done it.

00:36:40.659 --> 00:36:44.496
Why are you here, Sid?
Not in the car, at Slough House.

00:36:44.580 --> 00:36:46.540
I thought Slough House was like prison.

00:36:46.623 --> 00:36:49.459
You're not supposed to ask
what you're in for.

00:36:49.960 --> 00:36:51.295
Well, you know why I'm there.

00:36:52.045 --> 00:36:54.131
Yeah, but everybody knows
why you're there.

00:36:55.382 --> 00:36:57.467
I was gonna give you a compliment,
but you can shove it now.

00:36:57.551 --> 00:36:59.678
Suit yourself.
I get enough flattery from Lamb.

00:37:00.345 --> 00:37:01.430
But that's what I mean.

00:37:03.682 --> 00:37:05.684
He can see that you're not
like the others.

00:37:06.435 --> 00:37:07.853
Because you're not.

00:37:09.146 --> 00:37:11.523
I mean, Min,

00:37:12.065 --> 00:37:13.066
Struan,

00:37:14.026 --> 00:37:15.027
Roddy,

00:37:16.028 --> 00:37:19.990
maybe not Louisa, but definitely Moody,
they were always headed for the skids.

00:37:20.073 --> 00:37:21.450
They're useless, but you're…

00:37:22.826 --> 00:37:24.870
You know, it just doesn't make sense.

00:37:27.039 --> 00:37:29.875
But whatever the reason
for being put in Slough House,

00:37:29.958 --> 00:37:33.086
it must've come out of nowhere, right?

00:37:36.298 --> 00:37:37.299
Yeah.

00:37:38.884 --> 00:37:40.469
Yeah, it did, and it's just…

00:37:42.304 --> 00:37:43.972
just none of your business.

00:37:45.641 --> 00:37:46.642
Okay.

00:37:48.268 --> 00:37:50.938
-So how long are you gonna sit here for?
-Just until Hobden goes to sleep.

00:37:52.147 --> 00:37:53.524
Then I'm gonna go in there and find out

00:37:53.607 --> 00:37:56.026
what's on that laptop
he's been carrying around all day.

00:38:32.020 --> 00:38:33.397
-Hiya.
-You all right, love?

00:38:33.480 --> 00:38:36.525
-Yeah, can I get a vodka soda, please?
-Yep, ice and slice?

00:38:36.608 --> 00:38:37.609
Yes, please.

00:38:41.029 --> 00:38:42.739
I'm just gonna be round there.

00:38:43.907 --> 00:38:45.158
All right.

00:38:49.162 --> 00:38:50.747
Thought you were babysitting.

00:38:52.833 --> 00:38:54.334
Thought you were meeting a friend.

00:38:55.836 --> 00:38:57.087
Poor Struan.

00:38:58.088 --> 00:39:00.132
Yeah, if he saw us here, I think he'd cry.

00:39:00.716 --> 00:39:01.967
You're not going home, then?

00:39:02.676 --> 00:39:05.596
Well, no. I thought I'd just
decompress a bit first, you know.

00:39:05.679 --> 00:39:06.930
Yeah. Fair enough.

00:39:07.014 --> 00:39:10.684
It's been one hell of a day
protecting the nation.

00:39:11.351 --> 00:39:13.896
Imagine the consequences
if I didn't turn up for work, eh?

00:39:13.979 --> 00:39:15.105
Thanks.

00:39:15.189 --> 00:39:17.774
Well, then I'd be left alone with Struan.
So please keep showing up.

00:39:17.858 --> 00:39:19.610
You should get danger money for that.

00:39:23.071 --> 00:39:26.366
So I'm assuming you didn't have a friend
around last night either, then?

00:39:30.454 --> 00:39:32.372
You know,
I don't actually have any friends.

00:39:35.709 --> 00:39:37.628
No, I mean that I have--

00:39:37.711 --> 00:39:39.004
I have people that I know,

00:39:39.087 --> 00:39:41.548
but, like, no one that I can talk to.

00:39:41.632 --> 00:39:43.592
Not about work anyway.

00:39:44.635 --> 00:39:47.054
Do you not stay in touch with any
of your old colleagues from the Park?

00:39:48.138 --> 00:39:49.890
No, they kinda shunned me.

00:39:50.641 --> 00:39:52.059
Well, I wasn't just shunned.

00:39:52.142 --> 00:39:55.979
I was shamed by everyone

00:39:56.063 --> 00:39:58.565
after… you know.

00:39:58.649 --> 00:40:00.400
You left a top secret file on a train.

00:40:00.484 --> 00:40:01.902
Yes.

00:40:01.985 --> 00:40:03.237
That.

00:40:09.785 --> 00:40:13.455
I was shaving in the bathroom,
listening to the radio,

00:40:13.539 --> 00:40:15.040
when it hit the headlines that…

00:40:15.999 --> 00:40:18.544
well, the file had been found
by a member of the public.

00:40:19.962 --> 00:40:24.132
And Clare just said, "What fool did that?"

00:40:26.218 --> 00:40:28.053
And I just started crying.

00:40:29.596 --> 00:40:31.598
I thought maybe she'd hug me.

00:40:31.682 --> 00:40:33.559
But nah. She didn't.

00:40:33.642 --> 00:40:37.729
She just said, "Min, you fucking idiot."

00:40:37.813 --> 00:40:39.690
Wow. That's…

00:40:42.442 --> 00:40:46.822
-And are things okay now between you two?
-Oh, God, yeah. I'm getting divorced.

00:40:49.658 --> 00:40:51.869
I guess she saw me differently after that.

00:40:54.621 --> 00:40:56.248
And you let us all think
you had a home life.

00:40:56.331 --> 00:41:00.919
Well, yeah. I mean, I keep up the lie
partly because I don't want to accept it.

00:41:01.003 --> 00:41:03.964
Partly because I do not wanna give Lamb
any more ammo.

00:41:04.840 --> 00:41:06.925
And, well, perhaps most importantly,

00:41:07.009 --> 00:41:09.428
because it stops me
having to go to the pub with Struan.

00:41:10.179 --> 00:41:12.139
I mean, oh, my God.

00:41:14.266 --> 00:41:16.560
-He makes me yearn for Alan Black.
-Yeah.

00:41:16.643 --> 00:41:19.188
Black was like Struan with depression,
but at least he didn't, you know,

00:41:19.271 --> 00:41:21.106
wanna try and continue talking after work.

00:41:21.190 --> 00:41:23.192
He's just so freaking keen. He's like…

00:41:23.275 --> 00:41:25.527
-Yeah.
-…you know, "Let's do a monthly dinner."

00:41:25.611 --> 00:41:26.987
"Let's go paintballing." "Let's…"

00:41:27.070 --> 00:41:29.823
So I guess we'd say
to those who have taken him…

00:41:29.907 --> 00:41:33.994
Please, he's done no harm to you.
Just let him go.

00:41:35.287 --> 00:41:36.496
The police are now saying

00:41:36.580 --> 00:41:38.749
the threat to Leeds University student
Hassan--

00:42:05.526 --> 00:42:06.902
Get me Ho.

00:42:09.029 --> 00:42:10.489
I think he's gone.

00:42:12.032 --> 00:42:13.659
Then get him back.

00:43:43.207 --> 00:43:44.958
Who was Hobden trying to call?

00:43:45.042 --> 00:43:48.629
Just a bunch of right-leaning editors
and journalists,

00:43:49.254 --> 00:43:51.173
but none of them took his calls.

00:43:52.257 --> 00:43:54.426
But he rang Peter Judd seven times.

00:43:55.052 --> 00:43:56.595
Judd is the worst.

00:43:58.013 --> 00:43:59.223
Yeah.

00:44:05.687 --> 00:44:06.813
Hello?

00:44:09.066 --> 00:44:10.609
I can't talk at the moment.

00:44:12.402 --> 00:44:14.488
-No, I'm watching him right now.
-Update me later.

00:44:14.571 --> 00:44:16.573
I will, but I have to go.

00:44:17.366 --> 00:44:18.408
Okay.

00:44:19.993 --> 00:44:21.495
Who's Aunt Zadie?

00:44:27.626 --> 00:44:28.627
There is no Aunt Zadie.

00:44:28.710 --> 00:44:31.672
I put that in
so if anyone got into my phone,

00:44:31.755 --> 00:44:33.298
they wouldn't know
who I'd been talking to.

00:44:33.382 --> 00:44:34.842
Wait, well, who were you talking to then?

00:44:35.634 --> 00:44:37.386
Someone who knows
you're watching Robert Hobden?

00:44:38.554 --> 00:44:39.555
That's not what I said.

00:44:40.180 --> 00:44:42.307
Yes, you did.
You just said, "I'm watching him now."

00:44:42.391 --> 00:44:45.727
Listen… There's a reason I didn't
tell you why I'm in Slough House.

00:44:45.811 --> 00:44:49.648
No, no, no. Sid, really, seriously,
you don't have to tell me why.

00:44:49.731 --> 00:44:53.318
It's not for something you did in the
field, because you're a brilliant agent.

00:44:54.653 --> 00:44:55.779
Kind-of-brilliant agent.

00:44:55.863 --> 00:44:58.115
So it's obviously something to do
with your personal life,

00:44:58.198 --> 00:45:00.826
-which is none of my business.
-No. River, it is your business. I…

00:45:03.203 --> 00:45:04.830
I didn't just follow you here today.

00:45:07.165 --> 00:45:08.375
That was Taverner,

00:45:09.209 --> 00:45:10.836
and I wasn't telling her
I was watching Hobden.

00:45:10.919 --> 00:45:12.880
I was telling her I was watching you.

00:45:18.093 --> 00:45:19.094
Are you being serious?

00:45:21.305 --> 00:45:23.348
You're watching me for Taverner?

00:45:23.891 --> 00:45:24.892
Wha--

00:45:26.185 --> 00:45:27.728
Why would she want you watching me?

00:45:27.811 --> 00:45:31.148
Look, I don't know, but it's the reason
why I've been sent to Slough House.

00:45:31.231 --> 00:45:33.150
To keep an eye on you.

00:45:35.777 --> 00:45:36.778
You're kidding, right?

00:45:38.530 --> 00:45:39.698
No.

00:45:40.866 --> 00:45:41.950
No, I'm not. I'm--

00:45:46.622 --> 00:45:47.831
Shit.

00:45:49.666 --> 00:45:50.834
Shit. Look.

00:45:53.378 --> 00:45:55.047
I'll cover the front.

00:46:19.488 --> 00:46:20.864
Stop it!

00:46:23.825 --> 00:46:25.577
Please. Please.

00:46:28.872 --> 00:46:32.459
Get him off me. Get him off me!

00:46:33.585 --> 00:46:34.795
Listen to me.

00:46:34.878 --> 00:46:37.506
Let him go and put the gun down.
Armed response are two minutes out.

00:46:37.589 --> 00:46:40.133
If they see you with a gun,
they're just gonna kill you.

00:46:40.759 --> 00:46:42.302
-Did you hear me?
-What do you want?

00:46:42.386 --> 00:46:43.637
Put the gun down.

00:47:00.529 --> 00:47:01.530
Sid.

00:47:04.074 --> 00:47:05.534
Sid, are you hit?

00:47:06.410 --> 00:47:08.579
Sid? Shit, shit, shit, shit.

00:47:08.662 --> 00:47:12.249
All right. Okay, okay, okay.

00:47:12.958 --> 00:47:15.419
Sid, stay with me. Sid.

00:47:15.502 --> 00:47:16.879
Yeah, I need an ambulance.

00:47:16.962 --> 00:47:19.590
NW1, Maythorpe Road.

00:47:19.673 --> 00:47:21.675
Yeah, gunshot wound to the head.

00:47:22.342 --> 00:47:24.511
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
You'll see me, you'll see me.

00:47:24.595 --> 00:47:26.471
Just hurry up. All right.

00:47:26.555 --> 00:47:27.556
Sid?
