WEBVTT

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:03.636
Oh yeah.

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:04.511
- Yeah!
- Phew.

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:05.277
Oh!

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:06.799
Oh, look at me!

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:09.280
I want to see those tiny things again.

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:11.749
Eh. Huh.

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:15.430
Stay sexy. Always stay sexy.

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.153
Those tits. Uh.

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:18.270
Ooh.

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:19.469
Oh.
- Ah, yes.

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:21.431
So... fucking tiny.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.070
May I, er...

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:26.395
oh, yeah.

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:33.120
Um...

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:37.395
Oh God.

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.640
There's always a stage when someone's
falling in love with you

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.353
that they lose their erection.

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.989
They get confused. They panic.
The stakes get too high

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:49.836
the blood rushes from
their dick to their heart.

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:50.676
Oh Jesus.

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:53.712
And everything is fucked!

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:04.280
What?

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.270
Ah, no, I don't think Hilary's
gonna wanna hear this.

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:09.320
No, go on.

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:12.320
No.

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.360
No, go on.

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.356
OK. An 11-year-old boy
was put in juvenile prison

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.394
for repeatedly sticking rubber ended
pencils up the school hamster's arsehole.

00:01:21.976 --> 00:01:22.976
What?

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Yeah.

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:25.554
Why would they do that?

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.040
Apparently he liked it when
their eyes popped out.

00:01:28.064 --> 00:01:30.738
No, why would they send him away?
He needs help.

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.159
She was a surprising person.

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.200
They shouldn't have
just looked him up.

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.958
He pencil fucked a hamster.

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.400
Yeah, but he's obviously not happy -
happy people wouldn't do things like that!

00:01:41.424 --> 00:01:42.151
Fair point.

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.114
And anyway, that's the very reason why
they put rubbers on the end of pencils.

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:47.719
What, to fuck hamsters?

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:50.639
No. Because people make mistakes.

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:54.480
Hey.

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.280
Hey.

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:01.960
Hey.

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:04.995
Look, about last night.

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:06.600
Uh oh.

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.031
I don't usually connect with women.

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.112
I know,
that's what I like about you.

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:17.273
Yeah. OK. Um... I, er...

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:21.600
Wow.

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:25.840
This must be what insecure feels like.

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.440
Actually, can we speak about this later?

00:02:29.464 --> 00:02:31.899
I want to find the right words for you.

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:33.600
I'll see you at the sexhibition?

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:35.400
Yeah, see you there.

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.075
I'm gonna go to yoga.

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:38.360
OK.

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.479
Ooh. Marvellous.

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:51.431
I'm so relieved you're here.

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:52.480
Hi.

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:57.992
- And hello, good looking.
- Hi.

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:59.040
Hello.

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:00.680
Thank you.

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:02.875
Thank you.

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:04.920
Well clung to.

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:06.560
Thank you.

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.040
Does it get very boring

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:11.549
everybody telling you how
gorgeous you are all the time?

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.039
Er... a little.

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:15.555
Should we, er...

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:17.837
Oh, yes, I won't forget this, I promise.

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.040
Oh, sure. Is Claire here yet?

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.159
No, not yet.
You're an angel for being here.

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:25.470
Would you just hold onto that

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:28.911
and there are bottles for topping up
on the little bar just inside.

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.159
I'm the luckiest thing to have you.

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.798
And erm... there.

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:38.715
You're a natural.

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:52.953
No, really though, this sexhibition isn't
about me trying to get you all aroused

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:55.516
it's about the beauty of sex

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.278
and how it brings us all together.

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:00.240
How it excites and connects

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:02.352
how it opens people's minds.

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:04.678
After all, sex got us all here.

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.475
Sex brings life.

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:14.438
I've been building this sexhibition
since I was 11 and a quarter

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:16.876
which is when I first climaxed

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:19.871
by accident on a bidet.

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:23.508
The bidet is, of course,
exhibited here as are

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:26.159
all the pieces from my
first ever sexhibition.

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:28.200
All apart from one.

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:30.154
A few weeks ago

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:34.839
one of my most delicate pieces
was stolen from my studio.

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:39.072
But in a sense it was a blessing.

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:42.760
In fact, her brutal
snatching made me think of

00:04:42.772 --> 00:04:45.071
all the women of the world
who have been robbed

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:48.433
of their freedom, of their happiness

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:51.037
and, in the saddest of
cases, of their bodies.

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:54.429
So in many ways I have to thank the thief

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:58.196
for creating my most profound
piece of work to date.

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:00.240
A woman robbed.

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:08.276
Now I would ask you all to leave
your genitals at the door

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:10.914
and bring your minds to these pieces.

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:15.433
I don't believe people always think
about sex when they see a naked body

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:18.359
I believe they think
about their own minds

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:21.280
their own bodies and their own power.

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:25.199
And that's what this show is really about.

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:27.155
It's about power.

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:30.320
Thank you.

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:40.314
Beautiful. Beautiful.

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:46.869
Claire, it's me.
Just wondering where you are

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:52.916
'cause I am very much here
and waiting for you. OK, bye.

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:55.475
- Damn it, Claire.

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:58.400
Have you seen a sort of stressed
out version of me anywhere?

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:01.510
Is it weird that my mouth's watering?

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:09.232
It's really fantastic work,
honestly. It's amazing.

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:10.600
Thank you so much.

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:13.155
Yes, extraordinary.

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:16.314
Really, really moving and present.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.360
I'd love one of these on my floor.

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:20.315
Like a rug with perks.

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:22.909
I'm sure you would

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:25.270
but it's very securely nailed
to the wall this evening.

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:29.000
Have you found your father yet?

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:30.520
Oh yes, I think he's by the coats.

00:06:30.544 --> 00:06:33.297
Oh, no, no.
Have you found your father yet?

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:37.118
It's just so very obvious to me.

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:48.760
Yeah.

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:52.196
Er... Oh, Connor.

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:53.640
Oops.

00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:58.392
Look, about this morning.

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:02.320
God, listen, what I was trying to say is...

00:07:02.344 --> 00:07:03.414
Oh, here we go.

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:08.353
I didn't realise this until we were
having sex earlier and I lost my...

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:09.754
Erection.
- Erection.

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:10.676
One more time.

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:11.720
Erection.

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:16.235
But it made me realise

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:17.960
I'm in love.

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:20.960
Oh...

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:23.633
OK. I mean,
I don't really know what to...

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:26.035
And I don't want to
have sex with anyone else

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:28.477
and that's never
happened to me before.

00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:35.640
I'm in love.

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:40.719
And I need to tell her.

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:45.080
Her? - Yeah, we've been together
for a couple of months

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:48.397
and physically she just
never satisfied me.

00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:53.355
She has these really
massive bouncy tits

00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:55.960
that really don't do anything for me
and you just kept turning up

00:07:55.984 --> 00:07:59.579
like this sexy plank

00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:01.953
and it confused me.

00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:05.960
I just don't think I should be
fucking around behind her back anymore

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.277
but I just thought
that I should say that I am

00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:13.315
sorry if I have led you on.

00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:16.313
Oh. No.

00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:21.114
Oh God, no. My, um, my ex is
due back any day now anyway

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:23.879
so that's, um... I'm happy for you.

00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:28.829
Yeah... I I knew you wouldn't give a shit.

00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:30.075
Yeah, well, what can I say?

00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:33.839
I'm sorry. I don't give a shit.

00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:41.440
Cool.

00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:46.673
Never wear padding, OK?

00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:56.992
Claire, where are you?

00:08:57.040 --> 00:09:00.112
I can't survive much longer
in this sea of penises

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:01.992
and I don't know anyone and so...

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:05.440
Harry?

00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:08.480
Harry?

00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:11.960
Hi.

00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:13.400
Hi.

00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:15.874
What did she do to you?

00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:17.755
Well just, you know

00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:20.561
covered me in plaster and left me in
the garden for a couple of hours.

00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:24.712
Oh God, hi. Oh.
It's so good to see you.

00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:26.320
Oh.

00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:28.720
Hi.

00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:30.080
Hi.

00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:33.280
Hi.

00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:35.560
Hi.

00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:36.640
Um...

00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:38.353
I'm just gonna go and browse around.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:40.320
It was really nice to meet you.

00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:41.475
You too.

00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:45.269
That's Elaine.

00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:46.355
Hm.

00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:47.470
Hello darling.

00:09:49.336 --> 00:09:50.336
We're...

00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:53.000
Hey, did you see that really good
looking guy that <i>came</i> in with me?

00:09:53.024 --> 00:09:56.071
No, but I saw a really good looking
guy on his motorbike outside...

00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:56.837
Why?

00:09:56.880 --> 00:10:00.077
Oh, yeah, that's... he, um,
well he and I and...

00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:01.394
Oh, great.

00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:02.999
Yeah, he just dumped me, you know.

00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:05.873
Oh. Eh... um I'm sorry.

00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:09.710
This is very you.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:14.870
Yeah. Yeah... she, er, she said
you were cool with us doing... that.

00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:25.158
Yeah, I don't know why she... erm...

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:27.559
where's my penis?

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:28.880
Oh, it's on the wall over there.

00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:30.475
Second from the left.

00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:38.400
I should probably go and find Elaine.
She doesn't like being left on her own so

00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:40.113
You've still got some stuff at the flat.

00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:43.896
I've been rolling around
in my lingerie all over it

00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:45.480
waiting for you to come and collect it.

00:10:45.504 --> 00:10:46.230
Yeah, I...

00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:49.193
Just your, your Tupperware and
your TV and your dinosaur plate.

00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:50.833
Oh... I got a new dinosaur plate

00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:51.880
erm

00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:56.719
yeah... thank you.
But you can, you can keep those.

00:10:57.960 --> 00:10:58.960
Hey...

00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:01.593
do you still wank
about me sometimes?

00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:05.240
No.

00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:16.634
Elaine.

00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:20.755
Oop.

00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:28.600
Claire! My God, it's been hell.
Where have you been?

00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:30.510
. Erm.

00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:35.634
All parked up.

00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:37.600
Hello, you.

00:11:38.856 --> 00:11:39.856
Erm...

00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:41.359
We almost didn't make it but...

00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:44.437
We didn't wanna let the old boy down.

00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:49.160
But I thought that... - We're just gonna
do a quick whizz round to show our faces.

00:11:49.184 --> 00:11:50.354
OK I... but...

00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:52.000
We're just gonna do
a quick whizz around.

00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:02.600
Sorry, could you just... could you just do
something with those. Thank you, darling.

00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:55.709
Don't!

00:12:58.320 --> 00:12:59.674
Don't!

00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:06.912
The joys of butterfingered staff.

00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:11.319
Stop making a spectacle of
yourself and clean that up.

00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:13.280
You clean that up.

00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:17.675
Apologise.

00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:21.189
I'm sorry.

00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:25.077
Turns out I'm not such
a natural after all.

00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:31.238
Oh, fuck off.

00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:34.280
I'm just going to say this once.

00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:37.632
I deserve to be happy.

00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:40.835
I am allowed to move on.

00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:42.757
I have a good life

00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:44.313
and I am happy, alright?

00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:46.875
Alright?

00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:53.873
If you don't mind, I'm going to
go and get my cardi from the car.

00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:56.639
It's a little chilly.

00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:07.872
I'm sorry you had to hear that

00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:11.198
but you did have to hear it.

00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:14.071
No, no. She'll do it.

00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:26.440
What the fuck was that?

00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:27.915
What is he doing here?

00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:33.029
You're not going to Finland?

00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:37.029
Oh God.

00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:39.269
What are you doing here?

00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:40.355
I'm helping.

00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:44.432
He is...
- He didn't try to kiss you.

00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:46.120
He did.

00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:48.440
He says it was more like
the other way around.

00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:51.800
What?

00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:55.233
But that's just not true.

00:14:55.880 --> 00:14:56.880
Huh.

00:14:57.640 --> 00:14:58.835
No, fuck you.

00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:00.359
Claire...
- Please don't.

00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:02.357
No, Claire, he came
out into the garden...

00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:03.595
I don't wanna hear it.

00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:04.880
Claire, you have to believe me.

00:15:04.904 --> 00:15:06.075
How can I believe you?

00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:07.440
Because I'm your sister.

00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:09.232
After what you did to Boo!

00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:25.517
He slept with someone else. He said...

00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:28.800
He told me he fucked someone else.

00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:37.597
I'm sorry but you just have to
see it from my point of view.

00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:43.640
Come on.

00:15:58.920 --> 00:16:00.479
I think I love him.

00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:19.030
I'm gonna hurt myself.
I'm gonna get hit by a bike.

00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:22.240
I'm gonna hurt my finger and then he's
gonna have to come and see me in hospital

00:16:22.264 --> 00:16:24.733
and be really sorry for what he did.

00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:09.159
I don't know where you came from.

00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:12.951
What, you don't think we're the same?

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.037
You've got the same lines
on your forehead as me.

00:17:17.320 --> 00:17:18.958
Thank you for fixating on them.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:20.195
And you're stubborn.

00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:21.240
Snap.

00:17:21.896 --> 00:17:22.896
And sad...

00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:24.194
Not born sad.

00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:25.240
Some people are.

00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:26.280
You weren't.

00:17:26.320 --> 00:17:28.152
No. I guess not.

00:17:34.840 --> 00:17:38.629
Jesus, why do daughters get to say
that they're fucked up by their fathers

00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:40.717
when it's so often
the other way round?

00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:54.873
Why do you do that to yourself?

00:17:56.720 --> 00:17:57.720
Looks cool.

00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:04.312
I think your mother would have admired
your little performance up there.

00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:10.629
Do you ever think about her?

00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:13.880
Yeah.

00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:17.119
Do you think about your friend?

00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:20.040
All the time.

00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:21.400
Well.

00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:27.790
I'm sorry.

00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:45.589
Think you should go.

00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:13.832
Hi, this is Boo.
I can't come to the phone right now

00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:17.157
but please leave me a messiagio
and I will get back to you.

00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:24.838
Hi, this is Boo.
I can't come to the phone right now

00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:27.269
but please leave me a messiagio
and I will get back to you.

00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:20.880
You OK?

00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:25.600
Big night then?

00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:32.640
Hmm...

00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:34.880
What?

00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:40.910
I thought in the application for
your loan it said you ran a café

00:20:41.320 --> 00:20:42.674
for guinea pigs.

00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:46.273
That's why I thought it was funny. I...

00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:49.113
never thought guinea pigs needed...

00:20:49.160 --> 00:20:50.400
It's guinea pig themed.

00:20:51.816 --> 00:20:52.816
OK.
- Yeah.

00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:54.274
That makes sense.
- Yeah.

00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:04.310
Can I get you a cup of tea?

00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:06.280
Run out.

00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:08.120
Coffee?

00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:10.600
Run out.

00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:19.036
Well, I should probably be
heading back to the office.

00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:26.629
Cafés are a very difficult business.

00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:30.037
You certainly made this one very...

00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:33.280
. unique.

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:37.752
I also fucked it into liquidation.

00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:40.760
OK.

00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:44.272
And I fucked up my family.

00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:46.914
Did you?

00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:50.114
And I fucked my friend
by fucking her boyfriend.

00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:52.760
Right.

00:21:54.600 --> 00:21:58.639
And sometimes I wish I didn't
even know that fucking existed

00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:01.672
and I know that my body, as it is now

00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:03.518
really is the only thing I have left

00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:06.871
and when that gets old and
unfuckable I may as well just kill it.

00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:12.357
And somehow there
isn't anything worse

00:22:13.480 --> 00:22:15.949
than someone who
doesn't want to fuck me.

00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:19.358
I fuck everything.

00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:23.797
Except for when I was in
your office, I really

00:22:23.809 --> 00:22:25.996
wasn't trying to,
that was an accident.

00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:34.273
Either everyone feels like this a little
bit and they're just not talking about it

00:22:35.240 --> 00:22:37.629
or I am completely fucking alone.

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:42.593
Which isn't fucking funny.

00:22:52.280 --> 00:22:53.634
Right, well, er...

00:22:55.480 --> 00:22:57.517
I should probably, um...

00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:01.678
I should probably, um...

00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:06.069
I should probably...

00:23:40.120 --> 00:23:41.872
People make mistakes.

00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:51.676
That's why they put rubbers
on the ends of pencils.

00:23:53.880 --> 00:23:55.109
Is that a joke?

00:23:56.800 --> 00:23:57.800
I don't know.

00:24:01.880 --> 00:24:04.269
I think we should start
your interview again.

00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:08.200
Here?

00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:09.720
Yeah.

00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:11.280
Go on.

00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:12.960
OK.

00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:16.550
Well, thank you for coming in.

00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:19.635
No problem.

00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:24.559
I've read through your application form.

00:24:25.960 --> 00:24:28.873
Says you run a café for guinea pigs.

00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:32.629
Told you it was funny.
