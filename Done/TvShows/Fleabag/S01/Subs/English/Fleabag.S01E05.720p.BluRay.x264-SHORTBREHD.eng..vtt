WEBVTT

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:09.558
I mean we're all being very
grown up about this but...

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:11.273
Let me know if you feel any discomfort.

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:13.231
Oh no, it's lovely, thank you.

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:17.514
Your father informed me
of your family history.

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.279
Yeah, evil boobs everywhere.

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:20.800
Arm up, please.

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:28.669
Wa-he-hey... stop it!
I'm sorry, I'm just ticklish.

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:32.158
I examined your sister this morning.

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.272
Did you? Did she... is she alright?
Did she seem alright?

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.072
Yes. Why?

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.070
Just can't get hold of her.

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.033
She seemed very busy.

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:44.150
Mmm, sure.

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.278
Dad books us boob
appointments once a year

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.709
to make sure our tits don't
turn on us like mum's did.

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:53.277
It's a bit of a hassle but at the
end of the day it's nice to be touched.

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:57.799
Bet you look forward to seeing Claire.

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.961
A lot more to touch, if you
know what I mean. - SHE LAUGHS

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:05.077
I'm sorry, it's just that
there are worse jobs.

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:07.559
Look...

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.598
I check for cancerous
lumps in mammary glands.

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.554
Now, any pleasure I derive from that

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.389
is entirely dependent upon whether
or not I am about to save your life.

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:22.275
Of course, Doctor.

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.233
You can put your clothes back on.

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.799
Hey... hey... she's here.

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:38.416
I've been waiting out here
for nearly ten minutes.

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.351
Well, you left me
on the fucking silent hill.

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:41.595
Yes, well, I had to.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.150
Did you get back OK?
God this is so stressful.

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:45.349
Mum's memorial lunch.

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:46.720
I should have worn my other coat.

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.117
Visiting Dad is hell for Claire.
I see it more as a sport.

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:52.117
It's so inappropriate
that she should be here.

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:53.230
Have you spoken to Martin?

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.640
No, it's fine, everything's fine.
Everything's totally fine.

00:01:55.664 --> 00:01:56.779
Sounds like it's fine.

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.158
Can you please just gimme some space!
You're standing so close to me!

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:04.509
Ready?

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:11.680
Don't tell Dad about Finland
and don't provoke her.

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.956
Let's just get out of this alive, OK?

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:18.640
Girls...

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:20.675
Gotta hand it to her.

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:21.391
Hi.

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:22.475
Oh, you shouldn't have!

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.952
Oh, they're actually for Dad.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.320
Oh, are they Freesias?

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.120
Yeah, they were sort
of a favourite of our...

00:02:28.144 --> 00:02:29.896
Oh gosh, how special.

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:31.719
How lovely.
Aren't they stunning?

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:38.314
Oh, let's just leave them... there.

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.997
Lovely. Come in.

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:51.998
Who's Dad sawing in half?

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:53.040
Oh, just the tree.

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:54.349
Sorry?

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:55.356
The tree in the back garden.

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:56.720
Why are you taking the tree down?

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.958
Oh, Felicity tried to use it to get out.
She's very expensive.

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:03.240
This is nice.

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:04.920
Oh, thank you.

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:06.553
Oh, this is beautiful!

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.598
I hope you don't mind my being here
but my Pilates fell through so...

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.160
Oh, of course.
- Gosh, no, it's lovely.

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:17.035
It's a sad day. Sad, sad day.
I'll get the champagne.

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:29.159
This is my favourite bit.

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:35.553
Wonder who's going to...

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:36.920
That's a lovely cushion.

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.273
Thanks, it's an original.

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:41.080
Gosh.

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:46.835
I love your hat.

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:48.235
It's a hair scarf.

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:49.920
Looks like a hat.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.593
Well, it's a hair scarf.

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:55.920
OK.

00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:59.320
Is Martin coming?

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:01.358
Oh, no, he's away.

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:05.677
I'm very excited to meet
your new chap.

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:07.880
Is he...

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:09.639
Oh no, he's a different one.

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:12.674
Ooh. You do turn over fast.

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:19.277
Dad'II come in with some
weird canapes in a second.

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:20.920
Girls!

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:25.872
Hello.
- How are you?

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:27.638
- Hi.
- Hello, yeah...

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:32.554
yeah, I'm really sorry about all
that noise, it... you got a drink?

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:33.760
Oh.

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:36.275
Oh sorry. I forgot your glass.

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:41.155
Well, you're both looking
very healthy, very...

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:44.713
good and healthy and...

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:49.670
did you talk to
Dr Samuels about your...?

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:51.800
Yep.
- Yes.

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:57.032
And they're happy,
they're getting along alright?

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:59.478
Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah. Great.

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:00.794
Good. Excellent.

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:03.877
You are my...

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:06.920
daughters...

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:12.232
Yep.
- Yes. Yeah, we are.

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:15.120
Sit down.

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:20.835
I think I should say a few
words about your mother.

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:23.269
Ignore me. Ignore me.
Ignore me.

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:24.640
This day is not an easy one...

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:29.278
- Sorry. Cheers.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.000
To Mum.

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:32.440
To Mum.

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:33.960
To Margaret.

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:35.795
Dearest Margaret.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.274
Just the most generous woman.

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:40.400
Yeah, well, she certainly was.
- Yeah, she was great.

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:49.632
It was the voices
she used for the pigeons.

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:51.956
She always made them so, so rude

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.514
you know, but very, very funny.

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:58.591
She used to take the girls round
the park and point at the...

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:00.756
Oh, the squirrel voices were the best.

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:01.915
Run!

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:04.474
Run, fucking run!
- Run, run, run, run, run...

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:06.909
Run, run, run, run, run...

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:10.271
Yes, yes, my ex did a similar thing,
voices and fun.

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:12.678
Really, really funny man.

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:14.634
Really funny.

00:06:16.656 --> 00:06:17.816
Can I help you with the food?

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:19.911
Yes, yes, I should, yes.

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:20.995
And take that off.

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:22.040
Alright.

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:36.199
So are you going to Finland?

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:39.240
You're gonna have to
talk to me eventually.

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:48.355
Plaits...

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:51.878
either she's got her period
or some serious shit's gone down.

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:55.120
She always does something slightly
different around her period.

00:06:55.144 --> 00:06:57.260
She gets really bad PMT.

00:06:57.480 --> 00:07:01.394
Mum used to call it her monthly
confidence crisis but it's PMT.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.834
The only way she can get through it is
to reinvent herself in some small way.

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:14.560
What?

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:16.400
I'm doing a wee on this cushion.

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:17.440
What!

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:21.599
Sort of wish you were.

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:30.560
What are you doing?

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:32.432
Just put it back
where you got it from, OK?

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:33.197
No!

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:35.954
Just do it.
I don't want it in my house.

00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:39.796
I'm doing you a massive favour. She could
really go to town on you for this.

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:42.232
Come on, what's she gonna do, draw me?

00:07:42.576 --> 00:07:43.576
Go!

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:44.600
No.

00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:48.233
OK, OK, OK... Jesus.

00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:56.839
Why are we sneaking?

00:07:57.880 --> 00:07:59.075
We're not allowed upstairs.

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:00.120
Of course we are.

00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:13.591
God, I keep forgetting that
she's actually talented.

00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:15.199
I know, it's infuriating.

00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:17.360
Go on then.

00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:19.595
Where's her head?

00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:21.560
Well, she's got your boobs,
she doesn't need one.

00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:23.280
OK...

00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:29.920
OK. Hey...

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:33.720
is everything OK with Martin?

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:37.640
You've invited someone today?

00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:40.798
Yeah. Yeah, he's horrifically hot.
You're gonna puke when you see him.

00:08:41.696 --> 00:08:42.696
Are you on your period?

00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:43.720
Why would you ask that?

00:08:44.136 --> 00:08:45.136
The plaits.

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:46.160
No reason.
- Say it.

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:47.200
The plaits.

00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:51.991
Hey... do you think she's
ever painted Dad naked?

00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:55.993
I think you should take your nose
out of other people's marriages.

00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:00.476
Ooh, sneaking a preview, are we?

00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:05.517
Sorry, I spilt my champagne and...
I got distracted on my way to the bathroom.

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:08.230
Me too.

00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:12.113
It's really beautiful work.

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:14.276
Thank you.
Let me show you to the loo.

00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:17.233
Oh, that's alright,
grew up in this house.

00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:18.754
It's all change now though.

00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:23.995
Your father's in the kitchen.

00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:26.556
Oh great. I'll go and torment him.

00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:35.719
He hates being alone in
a room with me. Watch this.

00:09:37.136 --> 00:09:38.136
Hi, Dad!

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:39.434
Oh! Um...

00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:45.314
Um, I just need some...

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:46.960
What do you need?

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:48.991
Need some salt.

00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:50.560
There it is.

00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:53.309
Oh, here it is, yeah.

00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:57.991
So... how are you darling, you alright?

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:03.629
Have you got enough clothes?

00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:05.400
Oh, could never have enough clothes.

00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:07.432
Right. And how's the café?

00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:10.599
Erm. Well, the lease is up
in a couple of days and...

00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:12.233
I don't think I can really afford to...

00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:15.238
I think I'm just gonna
have to accept that it's...

00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:18.200
I'm sorry about that, darling,
but of course we're just a little bit tight

00:10:18.224 --> 00:10:19.355
in the purse strings too.

00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:21.311
Oh no, no, I wasn't asking you for any...

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:23.720
We've just been keeping it quiet,
we haven't been able to...

00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:25.393
buy anything or do anything and...

00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:30.234
Oh... what's that?

00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:37.509
Oh that, that's just a tiny little
house we're buying in... France.

00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:39.840
Lovely.

00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:43.990
Yeah. I... I just wanted to talk to you

00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:47.350
about this exhibition.

00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:48.674
What exhibition?

00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:52.632
- Oh no!
- Jesus, Dad, OK!

00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:56.230
Pick it up! Pick it up! Help me, please...
- Jesus, Dad, OK.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.435
She mustn't see it. She mustn't find out!
- OK!

00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:02.839
Mmm, five second rule.

00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:05.872
No, I have never bought into
that rule, that's disgusting!

00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:12.320
What are you doing?

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:15.400
Oh, just a little family tradition.

00:11:15.424 --> 00:11:18.064
Oh... what odd fun.
What are the rules?

00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:21.871
Oh... thank God,
that'll be your man.

00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:28.790
I mean I didn't wanna show off but...

00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:34.194
Gosh... you really are...

00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:37.240
So how did you two meet?

00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:38.760
Fucked me up the arse.

00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:44.034
I used to manage a bar and... I just found
her crying in the toilet one night.

00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:48.557
How about you two,
how did you two meet?

00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:49.760
Through our mother, actually.

00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:54.717
How is work, Claire?

00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:58.076
Oh... fine, nothing new.

00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:00.080
She used to be our Godmother.

00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:03.911
Still am. But then their parents split up.

00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:04.960
Mum died.

00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:07.033
And we just became even closer friends.

00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:10.869
Do you know... and I can say
this because I'm an artist

00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:13.833
but you really are very good looking.

00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:15.240
Thank you.

00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:16.920
Very.

00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:19.120
Thank you.

00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:20.280
Very.

00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:21.600
Thank you.

00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:23.915
I mean almost...

00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:27.557
too good looking.

00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:32.393
Well, if you'll excuse me I'm gonna
go and do that old human thing.

00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:40.672
How's the exhibition going?

00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:45.478
Ah yes, yes... I wanted to
talk to you about that.

00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:46.520
Talking about me?

00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:50.237
All good things, all good things, I swear.

00:12:51.576 --> 00:12:52.576
Oh and again.

00:12:56.600 --> 00:12:57.715
Have you found a venue?

00:12:57.760 --> 00:12:58.760
What exhibition?

00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:00.474
Thank you so much for asking.

00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:01.999
We have actually found a...

00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:07.274
There are some elements of the work that I,
you know, I wanted to talk to you about.

00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:08.833
It's a sexhibition.

00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:10.320
But don't panic, it's nothing scary.

00:13:10.344 --> 00:13:13.636
It's simply a journey through
my physical and sexual life

00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:17.639
climaxing in a few pieces inspired
by and moulded on your father.

00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:19.915
And there are photos.

00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:23.840
I've taken a photo of my naked body
every year for the past 30 years.

00:13:24.376 --> 00:13:25.376
Why?

00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:29.075
Well, I think it's important for women
of all ages to see how my body has changed

00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:30.269
over the years.

00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:34.798
I think we have to have a healthy
perspective on my body, don't they?

00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:36.395
Oh, absolutely.

00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:38.120
I mean, I don't need to tell you

00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:42.115
but your father is
a deeply sexual man.

00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:44.154
No, you don't.

00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:45.520
Just did.

00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:46.720
Knew it.

00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:51.397
I'm just very lucky.
I will be touched until the day I die

00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:52.510
and so will you, Claire.

00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:59.476
I mean, it's really all that humans want,
is to be loved and to be touched.

00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:16.000
Tell Dad about your promotion, Claire.

00:14:17.336 --> 00:14:18.336
There's nothing to tell.

00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:19.395
What promotion?

00:14:20.016 --> 00:14:21.016
Finland.

00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:22.792
Oh, odd place.
- Any news?

00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:24.319
No.
- She got it.

00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:26.078
- Oh!

00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:27.190
Fuck's sake.

00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:28.959
Congratulations, Claire.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:30.149
Thank you.
- Clever girl.

00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:31.031
Can we not.

00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:33.117
This is so exciting.

00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:34.195
She's turning it down.

00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:36.800
- Why?
- Why?

00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:38.816
- Why... why not, why Claire?
- Claire, are you pregnant?

00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:41.229
Why aren't you getting on a plane
to your cold rich future?

00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:43.400
Oh, Claire!
- This is everything you'd ever hoped for.

00:14:43.424 --> 00:14:45.954
You can't just fuck off on aeroplanes

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:50.392
and leave your weird stepson and
broken sister to fend for themselves, OK?

00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:05.590
Excuse me.

00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:22.280
She's your sister,
it's your job to annoy her.

00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:23.920
No, no, I'm just so annoyed with myself.

00:15:23.944 --> 00:15:28.859
I wish I could just meet myself and just...
have a go at myself!

00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:48.520
Do your worst.

00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:52.115
Come on, Bitch!

00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:56.039
You don't take yourself seriously.

00:15:56.520 --> 00:15:58.397
Oh pussy.

00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:01.351
You need to reach out to your family.

00:16:01.376 --> 00:16:03.456
You need to stop provoking your sister.
Just grow up!

00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:05.416
You do not take yourself
seriously as a businesswoman.

00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:08.080
You need to pay your fucking bills!
You need to be nicer to Hilary.

00:16:08.104 --> 00:16:09.299
You need to get a new hat!

00:16:10.016 --> 00:16:11.016
Is that better?

00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:12.269
Yeah, it's better.

00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:54.149
OK. Off you go.

00:16:58.440 --> 00:17:01.000
The artwork in this house is stunning.

00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:03.600
Who is it?

00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:06.309
If I tell you will you promise
to come to my sexhibition?

00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:08.400
It's not your work?

00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:10.320
Will you come?

00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:12.314
It would be an honor.

00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:15.954
How's your little restaurant?

00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:17.680
It's a cafe'.

00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:19.433
Oh, don't do it a disservice.

00:17:19.840 --> 00:17:21.911
I'm not. It's a café.

00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:23.629
Oh, sorry.

00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:27.429
It's fine. It's fine.

00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:32.237
Your father tells me you're struggling.

00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:33.873
Well... I think we all are.

00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:36.753
Oh, well, yes. But I mean,
now there's only one of you...

00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:38.600
God, I can't imagine
what you've been through.

00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:42.320
Sorry, have I missed something?

00:17:42.344 --> 00:17:44.954
Well... her dear little friend died

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.196
and left her to run the cafe on her own.

00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:48.240
Jesus.

00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:50.752
Oh God, that is truly awful.
How did she die?

00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:51.631
Oh, she killed herself.

00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:52.750
It was an accident.

00:17:54.680 --> 00:17:58.958
Well... maybe it's time to let the
little restaurant go, give it up.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:00.798
Sell it, have a little holiday.

00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:05.629
We did this.

00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:07.640
Mm-hmm.

00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:11.153
And whatever happens,
we never let it 90, OK?

00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:19.550
Excuse me.

00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:33.394
Have you seen Felicity?

00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:35.400
Oh no, sorry.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.480
Gosh, all sorts of things go
missing in this house, don't they?

00:18:38.504 --> 00:18:39.111
Big house.

00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:40.230
Yes, lovely house.

00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:41.995
Oh, the sculpture turned up.

00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:45.040
Did it?
- Yes. Must have just toppled off the side.

00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:47.591
Well... if you rid a woman
of her head and limbs

00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:49.560
you can't expect her to do
anything other than...

00:18:49.976 --> 00:18:50.976
roll around.

00:18:57.960 --> 00:18:58.960
What?

00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:01.754
Oh, your father and I often say

00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:04.792
when you've had a few drinks
you're so like your mother.

00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:18.593
Oh, whoops... look at these.

00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:23.111
So the party's moved to the hallway,
always a good sign.

00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:25.470
Does anyone mind if I leave,
I've got a dicky tummy?

00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:26.520
So swift.

00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:28.120
Thanks.

00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:30.760
I'm not going to kiss you
because I'm probably very ill.

00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:32.634
You too, come on.

00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:36.594
Goodbye then, my... my daughters.

00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:38.720
Goodbye.

00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:48.910
What a lovely occasion.

00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:52.118
Yeah, see you at the sexhibition.

00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:54.879
No, there's absolutely no need...
- Yes, lovely.

00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:57.639
No, no, we'll definitely be there.
I will definitely be there.

00:19:58.040 --> 00:20:01.032
Hold up... Yeah,
trying to keep me overnight?

00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:03.117
- Very good looking.

00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:07.360
I might never see you again.
You're very good looking.

00:20:07.384 --> 00:20:09.341
Yes, yes, very good looking.

00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:21.600
Thanks, I owe you.

00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:23.519
No, I owe you.

00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:26.280
It's been really nice to spend
the day with a normal family.

00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:28.840
I actually feel quite emotional.

00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:31.880
Will you stay with me tonight?

00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:33.840
Sure.

00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:36.074
I'm gonna go warm up the bike.

00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:39.120
Lovely to meet you, Claire.

00:20:39.144 --> 00:20:40.144
You too.

00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:42.394
Um, what's his...

00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:43.350
Fucked me up the arse.

00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:44.435
Oh that's...

00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:46.795
I totally see that now.

00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:55.029
I'm sorry if I was a...

00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:56.235
Listen to me...

00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:00.474
I'm going to leave Martin.

00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:03.192
I'm going to give you
the money for the cafe

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:05.673
and I'm gonna go to fucking Finland.

00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:08.149
OK.

00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:11.349
Oh and...

00:21:19.160 --> 00:21:20.840
That is the coolest thing
you've ever done.

00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:22.080
I know.

00:21:24.120 --> 00:21:25.120
Thanks, Claire.

00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:29.629
Shall we...?

00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:32.600
We can try.

00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:47.640
I'll see you at the sexhibition?
- Yeah.
