WEBVTT

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:24.719
Jogging.

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:32.591
I did a fart the other day
that was exactly like Mum's.

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.836
A door opening or suspicious duck?

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:36.279
Door opening.

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:38.194
Mean's your getting mum's bum.

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:39.992
God, I'd be lucky.

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:41.951
My bottom dropped ages ago.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.116
My farts used to be like, pah.

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.393
Now they're just sort of
fighting their way out.

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.314
I haven't farted in about three years.

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.155
Happy Birthday.

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:59.074
She won't eat it.

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:00.315
Thanks.

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:09.950
So, it's a 7pm arrival tonight
for a 7:30 surprise, OK?

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.354
Yeah, I got your email.

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.959
It's really a business birthday thing.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.356
It won't be much fun
so just don't expect a party party.

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:17.629
I won't.

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:21.594
And maybe just wear trousers.

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.039
And don't drink too much.

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:24.957
There's this huge promotion in Finland.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.517
So this party is quite a serious...
I mean, it's basically a business meeting.

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:31.437
Sounds like a blast.

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:32.675
Can I bring a date?

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:34.199
Harry?

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:35.240
Who?

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:37.752
Oh, I don't know yet.

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:44.394
It's really inappropriate
to jog around a graveyard.

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:45.475
Why?

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.075
Flaunting your life.

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:54.790
God, I can't wait to be old.

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.313
If it's any consolation,
you look older than you are.

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.353
Sorry. Sorry.

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.470
Hello, Claire speaking.
- Mum died three years ago.

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.750
She had a double mastectomy
but never really recovered.

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.714
It was particularly hard
'cause she had amazing boobs.

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.754
She used to tell me I was lucky
'cause mine would never get in the way.

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.871
My sister's got whoppers.

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.230
But she got all of Mum's good bits.

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:26.474
What's Martin given you?

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.955
Oh, cursory stroke'd be nice.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.513
What? No bang bang?

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.554
He say's he's still got
that thing on his...

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:36.200
What?

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.319
On his...

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.029
Come on, you can do it.

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:41.673
I don't have to say.
- Yes, you do.

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.960
No, not here. No.
- Come on, little one, come on, please.

00:02:43.984 --> 00:02:45.577
Penis.
- Thank you.

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:51.912
He says he still has
that thing on his penis, sorry.

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.752
Christ. Look at that man, tragic.

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:01.474
Nah, he's a con.

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:04.911
You can't call someone
who is grieving a con.

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:06.633
That is shit grieving.

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.896
Look at him. He is properly keening.
- No one grieve-s like that...

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:10.856
Who are you to pass judgement on his grief?
- Unless you're in a film or from Italy.

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:14.032
Trust me, he's at a different grave
every day. He can't get enough of it.

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:19.314
What?

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:21.431
You come here every day?

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:29.314
Don't do a jumpy-outy surprise thing

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:32.193
and don't sing happy birthday,
I couldn't bear it.

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:34.514
I'm, erm...

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:38.069
I'm actually looking forward to it.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.116
Hi, Harry, it's me...

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:43.520
Um, listen, I know we're broken up

00:03:43.544 --> 00:03:46.138
but it's Claire's birthday tonight
and I thought that, um...

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:53.194
Er, I thought that maybe, erm...
you'd like to come to her...

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:56.393
birthday party.

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:00.513
Um, anyway, give me a call
and hope you're OK. Bye.

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:09.753
Can't go outwith a dog.

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:23.952
My boyfriend before Harry

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.992
used to make me send him pictures
of my vagina wherever I <i>was.</i>

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.792
Ten or eleven times a day.

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:31.150
One day when I was temping,
he asked me to...

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:32.634
3:1“

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:39.198
3:1“

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:48.279
3:1“

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:54.799
3:1“

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:08.352
Time to throw the net out.

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:13.993
I am so in trouble.

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:15.474
Jesus Christ.

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:16.476
What am I gonna get Claire?

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:18.318
I am meant to get her
the perfect present.

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:19.919
I am not drunk.

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:20.960
Always drunk.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.037
I am not drunk.
- Oh.

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:25.117
Which is odd
because Claire's so straight.

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:27.037
Smack me in the face. Really hard.

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:28.718
Really?
- Yeah.

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:31.110
Oh. OK.

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:35.920
Fuck. Think you've given me a semi.

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:40.711
Can I eat a water
or a sandwich or something?

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:42.592
I mean, the man's got a problem.

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:45.109
Oh, speak to me. Speak to me.

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:46.840
But no one wants to admit
there's a problem

00:05:46.886 --> 00:05:49.806
because then they don't get to have
crazy nights outwith fun drunk Martin.

00:05:49.846 --> 00:05:51.590
Chicken, are you chicken? No.

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:55.679
He's one of those men who is explosively
sexually inappropriate with everyone

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:59.839
but makes you feel bad if you take offence
because he was just being fun.

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:03.032
Honestly, you could tell him you're
gonna pop to the loo and he'll say...

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:05.071
Yes, you pop to the loo

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:09.318
pull down your kickers and then
I will come in and fuck you.

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:16.038
I mean, this place is ridiculous.

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:17.832
Does anyone ever come in here?

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:20.440
I mean, it is creepy as fuck.

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:23.154
Why don't you get her a guinea pig?
It was a surprise hit here.

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:26.315
What? Do you think she'd like a pig?
Can I take this one?

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:27.509
No, not that one.

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:29.999
Christ, woman.

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:32.640
There's something wrong with that one,
it's got death in its eyes.

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:35.230
Yeah. Vet says she's depressed.

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:36.156
Oh.

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:38.237
Aren't we all, girl?

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:41.913
You know, guinea pigs
can die of loneliness.

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:43.754
Can they?

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:45.799
Hold her.

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:47.433
She needs it.
- No.

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:49.235
Ssh.

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:51.234
I have an idea.

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:53.715
Ah, he's sexually inappropriate
and he eats raw sausages

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:56.036
but no one's made her laugh like he does

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:57.639
so, I guess I have to give him that.

00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:00.559
Right, just put your, wait,
what are you doing, what are you doing?

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:01.556
No.
- All right, stop it.

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:05.116
No, no, no, there. There we go.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.071
I'm an innocent man.

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:10.794
I bought her a necklace
with her name on it

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:12.911
that she found
and told me not to buy.

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:16.112
I bought her a book,
that she already has.

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:18.913
And she says not to buy her any clothes

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:21.679
because she probably won't wear them.
She scares me.

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:25.755
Oh, this sandwich is so good.

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:27.234
Look, this is London.

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:29.999
Just fuck off and buy something
weird and expensive.

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:32.793
No, no. It's gotta be good,
all right? Help me.

00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:35.116
Pay me and I'll help you.
- Fuck off.

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:36.639
How much?

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:38.478
£60.
- 70.

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:39.874
Done.
- Yeah.

00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:46.756
I don't know who she is.

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:48.355
Is she...?

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:50.829
No.

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:53.718
What about...?

00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:55.475
No.

00:07:57.280 --> 00:08:00.432
Just... get whoever you are.

00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:02.679
Who are you?

00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:06.398
I don't know, I... wanna be that person.

00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:09.356
I have been that person.

00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:10.400
Hot.

00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:13.673
But most of the time I'm that person,
like everyone else.

00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:16.795
They're good, right? Chic?

00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:19.275
Chic means boring.
Don't tell the French.

00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:20.674
What about these?

00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:22.313
No. God.

00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:28.396
Look, stop checking, all right?
Nobody loves you. Help me here.

00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:33.000
Who is this person?

00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:35.316
Oh, fuck no.

00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:37.957
This is perfect!

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:39.991
Get her something
she'd never get herself.

00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:41.189
Surprise her.

00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:42.799
She'll think I've gone nuts.

00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:45.195
No, she'll think you see her
as this person.

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:47.675
And everyone wants to be this person.

00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:48.949
I don't know.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.310
Aren't these for children?

00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:52.360
No.

00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:55.074
Let's keep going.

00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:57.350
I saw some more stuff
she'll hate over there.

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:09.709
My neighbour is really fit.

00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:11.512
Which one?
- The fit one.

00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:13.119
The one with the sexy big belly?

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:14.878
No, no, he's the other neighbour.

00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:17.355
He's like, he's like, OK.

00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:20.798
I'm gonna hold his face in my head
so you can see him.

00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:21.989
OK.

00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:28.597
I'm not getting anything.

00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:31.029
Make your face his face.
- Yeah, OK.

00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:36.836
Is he mixed race? I'm getting mixed...

00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:38.154
Yes!

00:09:39.336 --> 00:09:40.336
That's him.

00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:41.589
Go on...

00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:42.710
(30. Yes.

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:50.954
Jesus.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.355
I'm really sorry, we're really high.

00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:56.199
We just really wanted to know
what you look like.

00:09:57.200 --> 00:09:59.350
She thinks you're lovely.

00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:12.679
Oh my God, look at my elegant feet.

00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:23.915
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey. Hello? Hey. Hey!

00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:27.317
What's your problem? Who was that?

00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:31.149
Er... Oh, no one, it was, er, what?

00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:34.989
No, no one, I just need to, I just need
to go and get a drink, or something.

00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:36.595
OK.

00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:38.836
Cool. Excellent.

00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:40.837
Can I go get my shoes?

00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:43.030
Yeah. OK.

00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:53.589
Whoa! Easy, tiger.

00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:57.799
Coming from you.

00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:02.238
So, come on,
who is that heartbreaker, hmm?

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.116
He used to go out with 800.

00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:09.280
And then he slept with
someone else and then she...

00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:13.638
Yeah, yeah. I know, OK. Fuck.

00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:17.917
I've never really said how sorry I was.

00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:19.519
You should get the trainers.

00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:21.959
She'll say I don't know her.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:23.035
You don't.

00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:24.798
You're just as bad.

00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:28.674
It's never clear what she wants.
I should just get her some perfume.

00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:31.633
Jesus. Just fuck her.

00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:33.717
Please, for the love of a good woman

00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:36.036
just wrap your willy up in a bow
and just screw her.

00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:37.559
She's going insane.

00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:42.479
What is it?

00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:44.959
You having an affair?

00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:52.119
Think you're a clever little puss,
don't you?

00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:55.191
Little marital poke isn't gonna kill you.

00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:57.550
Would it kill her to take me out to dinner?

00:11:57.600 --> 00:11:59.273
You girls, Jesus.

00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:01.152
Anyone said that to her,
they'd be hung.

00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:03.400
If they were hung, she probably
wouldn't be complaining.

00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:17.669
Little advice, from a married man.

00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:18.790
Oh.

00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:21.880
You should probably
get yourself out there, sweetie.

00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:25.993
You're just tipping your prime.

00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:32.553
Another drink, hmm?

00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:34.637
- Bingo.

00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:38.234
Excuse me, I have a date.

00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:41.839
Get the trainers, shop closes in an hour.

00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:47.959
Whoa, God, I was not
expecting to see you again.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:49.070
Shut up.

00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:51.120
I mean don't get me wrong,
I am chuffed to my boots

00:12:51.144 --> 00:12:53.832
but yeah, oh, and thank you
for the text. Saucy.

00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:56.440
- Oh, and sorry I'm late.

00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:57.993
Oh no, it's fine, it was last minute.

00:12:58.040 --> 00:13:00.509
No, no, no, I am such a tool box.

00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:02.736
You know, I'd like to say I was
trying to save a puppy or something

00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:05.521
but I just got my coat caught on
someone else's coat outside the Tube.

00:13:05.562 --> 00:13:07.618
You know, we had to separate ourselves,
it was fucking intense.

00:13:07.642 --> 00:13:09.477
I had to give him my coat.

00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:10.590
What are we doing?

00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:12.480
Well, it's my sister's
surprise birthday party.

00:13:12.504 --> 00:13:13.794
I love surprises, go on.

00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:16.200
Yeah, but I just thought,
I need to get her a present first.

00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:17.760
Oh my God, what are you gonna get her?

00:13:17.784 --> 00:13:19.398
I know this beautiful soap shop.

00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:22.717
I mean, this stuff just
gets you straight in the bath.

00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:25.115
Oh, I was thinking more like...
- Yeah?

00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:32.557
Oh yeah, these places,
all the time, so yeah.

00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:35.480
You OK?

00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:36.520
Yeah.

00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:38.312
Sorry. I won't be long.

00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:39.634
Oh...

00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:44.240
Hi.

00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:45.230
- Hi!
- Hi.

00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:46.509
- Hi.
- Hey.

00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:48.312
What are you craving?

00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:50.670
Oh, just a really, really cheap thrill.

00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:51.630
For you?

00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:53.671
Ooh. Hello.

00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:55.677
No, it's for her sister.

00:13:55.720 --> 00:13:58.280
Yeah, it's for my very
sexually frustrated sister.

00:13:58.320 --> 00:13:59.680
Just a basic bunny would be great.

00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:03.076
OK. Well, I'll see what I can dig out
and you go browse.

00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:05.153
Thanks.

00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:13.398
Oh.

00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:16.671
Oh, I think you just
do it at the bottom.

00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:23.038
It's always a twist.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:28.035
Ooh.

00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:32.393
Whoa.
- I know.

00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:34.909
Yeah. You should totally
get one of those.

00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:36.439
A vagina?
- Yeah.

00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:37.800
Oh, I've already got one.

00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:41.597
Really? You have?
No, you've got one?

00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:43.119
I take it with me everywhere.

00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:44.753
Look, no, you lie.

00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:46.518
You don't have one on you now?

00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:48.039
Yeah. Never gonna get it.

00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:49.354
Where?

00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:50.754
Where's my vagina?
- Yeah.

00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:53.236
Where's my vagina?
- Yeah.

00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:56.075
Ha, you got me!

00:14:56.120 --> 00:14:58.714
I don't carry a vagina around with me.

00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:01.513
That'd be way too provocative.

00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:04.833
Didn't get it.

00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:06.678
OK, so this one's really great.

00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:09.553
It's half price because
it's quite relentless.

00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:11.193
It's called The Burrower.

00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:14.358
Basically it doesn't stop
until you've come.

00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:16.038
Excuse me

00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:18.356
Oh, don't worry about him.

00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:19.595
He'll be fine in a minute.

00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:22.758
Oh my god,
I love surprise parties.

00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:25.269
I love them, I love them,
I love them, I love!

00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:27.200
Will your parents be there?
- My dad might be...

00:15:27.224 --> 00:15:28.737
Oh, intense.

00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:30.554
Parents adore me.

00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:35.037
Um, I want you to be totally in love
with me by the end of the night.

00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:36.559
OK?
- OK.

00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:39.394
Who's that?

00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:43.589
Oh, it's my sister.
- Wow! No. No, no.

00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:45.560
We're going to ruin the surprise.
- No, no, we...

00:15:45.584 --> 00:15:47.197
No, no, no. - No, really.
- Get down.

00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:48.116
It will be fine.

00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:49.594
Surprise!

00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:51.074
Oh my God.

00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:53.873
Thank you so much.
I'm so surprised!

00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:55.354
She's very good.

00:15:55.400 --> 00:15:57.630
How divine,
what a lovely husband you have.

00:15:58.440 --> 00:15:59.839
Where is he then?

00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:03.197
Ah, busy.

00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:07.680
I'm blown away,
I had absolutely no idea.

00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:11.080
Oh, Hildegard, can I just
talk to you for a second?

00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:13.431
Hello.
- Hello.

00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:16.720
Er, Dad. Hi.

00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:21.551
Thank you for asking, yeah.
I'm essentially a documentary maker.

00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:22.600
Docs.

00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:26.999
Oh really?
What is your latest project?

00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:30.158
Well, sir, I'm interested in life.

00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:35.957
And how it affects lots of people
in all sorts of different ways.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:37.832
Yeah. It's awesome.

00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:39.757
How did you two meet?

00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:41.438
Oh, I met her on a bus.

00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:43.153
So easy to pick up girls these days.

00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:45.350
I was like, hi, and she's like
oh take my number.

00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:47.277
- I was like yeah.

00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:50.555
I'm just gonna see if there are
any other wines to try.

00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:52.760
It's lovely, I'm just gonna see
if there's some others.

00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:57.310
Excuse me. Can't resist.

00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:02.878
Find anything nicer?

00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:06.390
Oh, I was so sorry
to hear about Harry.

00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:08.113
Lovely Harry.

00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:09.798
Love Harry.

00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:12.157
Exciting news about his new job.

00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:15.437
Yes. Very exciting.

00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:18.552
I was so pleased that you
found someone else so fast.

00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:19.670
Mm.

00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:24.069
I just can't stop conjuring an image
of you sitting around that café.

00:17:24.120 --> 00:17:27.272
Just all alone.
Feeling so terribly lonely.

00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:30.115
I just can't stop picturing it.

00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:34.070
I don't think you have to be
alone to be lonely.

00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:36.236
Dad always taught me that.

00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:40.193
Did your father tell you that
one of my pieces has gone missing?

00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:43.392
He did. That's awful, I'm so sorry.

00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:46.754
So sweet of you. Very sweet.

00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:48.793
May I cut in?

00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:50.594
Yes, of course.

00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:54.599
Do you know, you are
the most perfect-looking pair.

00:17:57.400 --> 00:17:58.879
Such a great gang.

00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:00.638
Do you want some normal food?

00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:02.193
No. No.

00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:06.359
Erm, what I really want to do is this.

00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:08.552
Whoa!

00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:10.591
Oh sorry, nothing happened!

00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:12.438
I was trying to be sexy.

00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:14.596
So... no, it <i>was,</i> it was really sexy.
- Was it?

00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:16.039
What broke, what broke? Show me.

00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:19.516
Nothing, I just slipped.
Claire, this is my friend...

00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:21.676
Yes, yes. We've already met.

00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:26.510
My wife, my wife, my wife.

00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:32.151
All of your desires
are wrapped up in here.

00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:34.679
OK.

00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:35.790
Open it.

00:18:40.040 --> 00:18:43.635
Well, gold has always...

00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:48.357
Wow! Er...

00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:52.116
That's really rather wonderful.

00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:55.915
Thank you. What is it?
Is it a paper weight or...?

00:18:55.960 --> 00:18:58.520
It is a shrine to your body.

00:18:59.320 --> 00:19:00.833
Because I love your body.

00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:03.518
- Thank you.

00:19:03.560 --> 00:19:06.916
Wow! Wow. This is really...

00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:10.635
Can I, can I see, it's,
it's really quite something, yes.

00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:12.273
Wow, I think it's really...

00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:16.632
Might be a bit inappropriate
for your guests to see your body at this...

00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:18.360
I'm just... Shall I put it somewhere safe?

00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:19.674
OK.

00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:40.635
Smooth.

00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:43.479
Well, I told you I'd find you a buyer.

00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:52.032
Your boy, he is hilarious, smart, funny...

00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:53.639
Fuck off.

00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:56.751
You'd fuck anything, wouldn't you?

00:19:58.680 --> 00:20:01.433
Just don't tell her you got
the statue from me, OK?

00:20:01.480 --> 00:20:03.915
Oh. How much do you want for it?

00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:06.395
Finger up the ass? Nipple tickle?

00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:11.834
Come on. Lighten up.

00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:17.235
She's gonna leave you one day.

00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:23.076
Looking forward to that?

00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:42.672
You're an asshole.

00:20:57.680 --> 00:20:59.114
Hey!

00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:02.560
Hey.

00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:09.960
I think you took my coat.

00:21:10.336 --> 00:21:11.336
Oh.

00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:13.510
I'm sorry. This is my coat.

00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:15.278
Oh, sorry.

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:17.638
Why you leaving so early?

00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:22.197
Oh, I have to give Hilary some earl grey.
She's not feeling well, so.

00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:24.632
Oh, got you this.

00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:26.876
Oh, I wasn't expecting anything.

00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:35.396
It's called The Burrower.
It basically won't stop until you come.

00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:37.592
Sounds horrendous.

00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:38.960
Thank you.

00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:42.036
Good birthday business?

00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:43.753
Oh, huge.

00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:48.075
You know, I don't wanna
jinx anything, but huge.

00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:49.793
Could be life-changing.

00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:51.554
Great.

00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:53.999
OK, happy birthday.

00:21:54.040 --> 00:21:55.519
Thanks.

00:21:56.680 --> 00:21:58.114
Are you OK?

00:21:58.840 --> 00:21:59.989
Yeah.

00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:02.113
Tell the truth.

00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:05.674
Are we leaving?

00:22:06.696 --> 00:22:07.696
Yes.

00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:09.154
Birthday girl.

00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:12.397
Awesome party, thank you so much,
we had such a great night.

00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:13.589
Oh. Whoa.

00:22:13.640 --> 00:22:15.950
Oh, what's that? Oh.

00:22:18.096 --> 00:22:19.096
Goodnight.

00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:20.838
Goodnight.
- Night.

00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:31.720
Shall we?

00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:38.918
Surprisingly bony.

00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:42.078
I've nearly finished, I've nearly finished.

00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:43.997
It's like having sex with a protractor.

00:22:44.040 --> 00:22:46.236
I'm finishing, I'm finishing.

00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:50.513
I'm, I'm done, I'm done. I'm done.

00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:52.198
Oh OK.

00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:54.559
Whoa! Yeah.

00:22:54.600 --> 00:22:56.318
Are you done?

00:22:56.360 --> 00:22:58.556
Oh yeah. Yeah.

00:22:58.600 --> 00:23:00.477
Amazing, that was amazing.

00:23:00.520 --> 00:23:02.318
That was amazing.
- Yeah. Yeah

00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:07.480
That was amazing.
- Yeah.

00:23:11.320 --> 00:23:13.072
For fuck's sake.

00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:14.190
What?

00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:17.994
OK, you don't go through life
with teeth like these

00:23:18.040 --> 00:23:21.032
and not know when
someone's pretending.

00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:28.396
What the fuck is that?!
I'll kick it, I'll kick it.

00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:29.396
No. no.

00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:31.795
I'll kick it, I'll kick it. What?

00:23:34.040 --> 00:23:35.872
Did we catch that, or is that yours?

00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:37.797
That is a rat.
- It's a guinea pig.

00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:39.035
That is a rat.
