00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:27.313
Just don't... talk too much

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.416
or try to pretend you know anything
about the company.

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:31.750
OK.
- And don't be funny or clever or...

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:33.456
Just don't be the centre of attention.

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:34.856
These people are very important to me

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:36.155
so just don't...
- OK.

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.714
...don't be yourself.

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:40.190
I won't.

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.276
Fuck's sake.

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.638
I know people in this building.

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:52.680
Anyone could come...

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:54.640
Hi, Claire.

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:55.760
Hello, Leslie.

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:05.794
Ooh, that's lovely.

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:07.235
What is that?

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:11.279
We have a load of vegetarians

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.216
so make sure it's clear
which ones have meat in them.

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:14.496
Loves a crisis.
- We have a couple

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:15.576
of waitresses for the drinks

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.056
so if you could hand round the food.
- Mm-hmm.

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:18.376
Put her in a quiet room
with a nice breeze

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.176
she'll have a panic attack.
- Where is everyone?

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:21.200
She's so happy.

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:22.874
God, this is stressful.

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:25.560
Don't be weird
about how big my office is.

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:27.834
What the fuck?

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.355
- I know.
- Are you a...

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:31.756
It's over the top. I know. OK.

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:33.553
Put them on the table.
Not that table.

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.275
Oh. You OK?
- Of course. It's just

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.510
it's just, it's a big night

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.760
and the Finnish partners are here,
so it's all a bit...

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:42.551
- Oh, check the award.
- Why?

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:45.216
Just to make sure it's not pink
or anything horrifically female.

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.240
She'll loathe that.

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.078
Be careful with it.
It's worth thousands.

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:49.760
It's not pink.
- Good.

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:51.480
It's perfect.
It looks like a sperm.

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.000
Your hair looks nice.
- Shut up.

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:55.393
OK, don't sit on that.

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.034
OK, put those on the posh plates.

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:59.640
Put the award
behind the microphone.

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:00.910
Oh, and, um...

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:07.880
Thank you.

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.316
You've really, uh...

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Thank you.

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.513
Don't play with that.

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:21.675
Oh, that's heavy. Argh!

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.355
Oh, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck,
fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:29.830
My God.

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:10.113
Where have you been?
- Oh, sorry.

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:11.696
I just had to get the vegetarian bites.
But it's all fine.

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.916
You're gonna love them.
- You're sweating so much.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.559
Sorry.
- It's attention-grabbing.

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.757
It's only on one side.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.515
Um, sorry, this is, uh, Sylvia.

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:22.256
She's going to be
presenting the award

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.715
so when you hear me
introduce her, get her onstage.

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:26.678
Hi.
- Has this got shellfish in it?

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.439
No.
- Fine.

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:31.520
Four CEOs have been fired.
Two are being taken to court.

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:32.755
I mean, it's just sad.

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:34.195
We felt like a family.

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.576
Yeah. Especially sad
when you have to tell your family

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.592
not to touch each other up
by the photocopier.

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.353
Stop making jokes.

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:43.880
I'm sorry. I can't help it.
- You can.

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:46.711
Oh, Belinda's coming.
Don't speak to Belinda.

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.920
Hello, Claire.
- Hello, Belinda.

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:51.839
God, you're tasteful.
- Mm.

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:53.310
Ooh, are these meaty?

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:00.109
Say something.

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:01.336
Um, no,
I think they have courgette in them.

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:02.874
Oh, I love courgette.

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:06.279
You can treat them appallingly
and they still grow.

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:12.598
She seems lovely.
- Yeah, she's great.

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:14.760
So who are you so nervous about?

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:17.156
I'm not nervous.
I'm being completely...

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:18.793
Claire!
- Oh!

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:20.435
Hi. Oh!
- Oh, wow.

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:23.080
Oh, sorry. I-I'm-I'm so glad
you could come.

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:24.879
- Of course. It's my job.
- Ah.

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:26.718
This is my catering.
She's the sister.

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:27.955
Hi.
- Ah.

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:30.396
I ate a sausage over there,
thinking it was a prune.

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:31.440
Oh.

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:33.278
Fifteen years of vegetarianism, gone.

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:34.356
Like bang, bang.

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:35.470
Oh.

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:36.896
We do actually call them "bangers."

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:38.673
Ah! That's funny!

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:39.950
Yes, it was.

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:42.920
So, how do you two know each other?

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:44.873
Uh, we're partners.
- Uh, we are partners.

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:47.096
Um, business partners in, um...
- Yes. She's been working with me

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:48.600
- in Finland, and, uh...
- Yes.

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:49.720
We don't get to see each other

00:04:49.721 --> 00:04:51.120
that much, but I'm...
- No, exactly.

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:52.480
I'm a huge...
- I'm a big fan.

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:54.552
Thank you. Admirer.

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:59.716
I'm going to get a drink.
Do you want anything?

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:01.678
Oh. Uh, champagne, please.

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:03.296
Oh, off the wagon?

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:04.515
Oh, just when I'm with you.

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:08.273
Let's go fucking crazy tonight, then.

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:09.914
Hmm?

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:11.720
What did you say?

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:13.793
No, no. I, um, I was...

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:15.439
No, what did you say?
- Oh, just, uh

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:16.760
uh...

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:18.872
I just said,
"Let's go fuck like crazy tonight."

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:21.400
Oh, God. Uh...

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:23.996
OK!

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:33.800
Shut up.

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:35.240
Oh, my God.

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:38.119
He is a very good businessman.
He's just socially sort of...

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:39.714
And what's, um...
- Shut up.

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:42.077
Claire.
- Please don't. Please don't.

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:43.039
I can't cope. OK?

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:44.076
OK.

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:46.120
What's his name?

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:49.360
What's his name?

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:51.960
Klare.

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:55.320
What?

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:57.675
His name is Klare.

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:00.314
Don't.
- Mm.

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:03.552
Oh, God, I have to announce.
OK, mingle.

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:04.995
But don't talk to anyone.
- OK.

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:06.355
I'm not in love with him.

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:07.680
OK.

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:15.553
Hi, everyone.

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:18.155
I am very proud
to announce the nominees

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:20.152
for the Women in Business Awards

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:22.160
sponsored by us here at Hurbots.

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:24.393
Amongst our exceptional women

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:26.751
we have Georgina Franks.

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:31.235
Belinda Friers.

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:35.596
And another extraordinary woman

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:37.475
Klare Korhonen.

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:42.309
Oh, uh, sorry. I-I think
there's been a mistake here.

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:44.472
I... and, uh, Elizabeth Sawkin.

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:51.030
Congratulations to you all.
Have a wonderful evening.

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:53.271
We will be presenting the award
very soon.

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:55.030
I'm gonna introduce Sylvia

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:56.176
who's gonna introduce Belinda.
- Uh-huh.

00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:58.056
When you hear me introducing
Sylvia, get her onstage.

00:06:58.080 --> 00:06:59.799
It has to go like "cockwork."
- Like what?

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:01.640
"Cockwork."

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:03.056
Claire, your brain
is somewhere else right now.

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:04.639
Just... Sylvia. Go.

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:06.950
Sylvia.

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:14.155
Crap.

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:17.599
A huge thanks to Matthew,
Mark Luke and John

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:18.955
for coming up with this award

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:22.431
and to Linkedln for connecting
us all this evening and beyond.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.118
I am so excited
to introduce Sylvia Hamber

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:28.311
this year's winner
of Women Who Work...

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:30.520
...who will announce this year's

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:32.671
Best Woman in Business. Sylvia.

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:34.800
What an entrance!

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:45.720
I'll do it.

00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:48.516
I can do it.

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:51.476
Um, I'm sorry.

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:53.671
It appears that Sylvia is busy

00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:56.434
which shouldn't come
as a surprise, really.

00:07:57.280 --> 00:07:58.280
Uh...

00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:01.080
It's-it's been a big year
for business.

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:03.799
Particularly women in business.

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:06.874
Men have been pretty hands-on
the past few decades.

00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:12.639
I'd like to thank
all the brilliant men and women

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:14.553
for supporting each other
here at Hurbots.

00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:16.472
We're a... a family, really.

00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:18.696
And if we've learned anything
during the past 12 months

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:20.951
it's that family really
shouldn't touch each other up

00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:22.040
next to the photocopier.

00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:27.076
Funny!

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:29.550
I am honoured to present this award

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:32.872
to this year's
Best Woman in Business...

00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:35.675
Belinda Friers.

00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:37.520
Fuck's sake!

00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:02.832
Thank you, thank... thank you.

00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:05.320
Well, um...

00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:09.496
Well, I was going to say this is a bit
on the nose

00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:11.751
but she doesn't seem to have one.

00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:13.759
What were you thinking?
- It'll be fine.

00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:16.952
It's not fine. I awarded her
with a pair of tits.

00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:19.120
Chase her down.

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:21.955
Chase her down?
- It's a stolen piece of art.

00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:23.416
I will deal with the photographer.

00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:24.760
- Claire!
- Oh!

00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:26.792
Oh, my God, you were brilliant.

00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:29.036
Thank you, Klare.
- I loved the joke.

00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:31.511
Ah.
- Oh, well, I didn't think it was that funny.

00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:33.280
Can you go, my love?

00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:34.993
Oh, I'm just gonna...
- Take the stairs.

00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:36.794
OK.

00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:57.994
I'm trained in martial arts.

00:09:58.160 --> 00:09:59.720
It's just the basics, but it is enough.

00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:01.240
I work at Harbots.

00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:02.520
Hurbots.

00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:05.832
Yes, I ate a courgette off your tray.

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:07.550
Yeah.
- It was delicious.

00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:09.239
Thank you.
- What do you want?

00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:11.600
That.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.196
I-I need to take your award back.

00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:17.832
Why?
- It's a stolen piece of art.

00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:20.240
It's not really an award.
It's all my fault. I can explain.

00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:21.750
Is it a long story?

00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:23.720
Sort of.

00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:27.520
And she still doesn't
know you have it?

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:29.910
That's glorious.

00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:31.840
I think you did exactly the right thing.

00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:33.992
I think you're the only person
who thinks that.

00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:37.831
God. Women's awards.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:39.000
Congratulations.

00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:41.231
Oh, it's infantilising bollocks.

00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:43.993
Well, don't you think it's good that...

00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:45.912
No. No. It's ghettoising.

00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:47.872
It's a subsection of success.

00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:51.470
Ah, it's the fucking
children's table of awards.

00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:53.836
Why did you go?

00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:56.153
Because I'd be an arsehole not to.

00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:57.320
Ms Friers.

00:10:57.600 --> 00:10:58.600
Thank you, darling.

00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:01.240
Gosh, she's hot.

00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:02.600
Yeah.

00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:04.320
Are you a lesbian?

00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:06.199
Not strictly. You?
- Mm.

00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:09.160
Mm. Do you like old films?
- Some.

00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:11.153
And what's your favourite period film?

00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:13.840
Carrie.

00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:17.995
God.

00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:20.513
God, you are a tonic.

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:23.238
What do you do?
Are you a "woman in business"?

00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:24.760
I run a café.
- Oh.

00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:26.400
Oh, good for you.

00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:28.955
Did you make the canapés?

00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:31.790
Uh, no, actually, I stole them.

00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:35.440
How old are you?

00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:37.233
Fifty-eight, and you?
- Thirty-three.

00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:39.875
Oh. Well, don't worry.
It does get better.

00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:42.471
You promise?
- I promise.

00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:45.352
Listen, I was in an aeroplane
the other day

00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:49.075
and I realised... well, I-I mean

00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:51.072
I've been longing to say this
out loud, so...

00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:56.474
Women are born with pain built in.

00:11:57.600 --> 00:11:58.920
It's our physical destiny.

00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:03.120
Uh, period pains, sore boobs,
childbirth, you know.

00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:07.672
We carry it within ourselves
throughout our lives.

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:09.160
Men don't.

00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:10.715
They have to seek it out.

00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:12.911
They invent all these gods
and demons and things

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:14.719
all so they can feel guilty
about things

00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:17.520
which is something we do
very well on our own.

00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:19.917
And then they create wars
so they can

00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:21.999
feel things and touch each other

00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:24.096
and when there aren't any wars,
they can play rugby.

00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:27.830
And we have it all going on
in here, inside.

00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:31.750
We have pain on a cycle
for years and years and years.

00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:36.551
And then, just when you feel you
are making peace with it all, what happens?

00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:38.480
The menopause comes.

00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:41.638
The fucking menopause comes,
and it is...

00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:45.553
...the most

00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:49.759
wonderful fucking thing in the world.

00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:52.958
And yes, your entire pelvic floor crumbles

00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:55.470
and you get fucking hot,
and n-no one cares

00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:56.800
but then...

00:12:57.640 --> 00:12:58.640
you're free.

00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:01.400
No longer a slave

00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:04.319
no longer a-a machine with parts.

00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:07.958
You're just a person, in business.

00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:10.200
Oh.

00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:12.755
I was told it was horrendous.

00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:14.673
It is horrendous,
but then it's magnificent.

00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:16.840
Something to look forward to.

00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:23.720
You better get back
to that party.

00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:26.998
Your party.
- Mm. It is not a party

00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:28.795
until someone flirts with you.

00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:31.600
And that's the only really
shit thing about getting older

00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:34.036
is that people don't flirt
with you anymore.

00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:36.352
Not really. Not with danger.

00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:39.035
I miss walking into a room
and not knowing

00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:42.392
and there's a sort of energy,
a dare.

00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:44.871
And do not take that for granted.

00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:50.191
There is nothing more exciting
than a room full of people.

00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:52.400
Yeah, except most people are...

00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:54.120
What?

00:13:56.240 --> 00:13:57.240
Shit.

00:13:57.520 --> 00:13:58.520
Oh.

00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:00.280
Look at me.

00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:02.350
Listen.

00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:05.234
People are all we've got.

00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:10.237
People are all we've got,
so grab the night by its nipples

00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:12.039
and go and flirt with someone.

00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:15.155
Mm. No, that's not what I meant.

00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:20.990
Mm...

00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:23.959
Oh. I wish you were my type.

00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:27.910
You take this tart back to my party

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:29.856
and go and find someone
to actually do that with.

00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:31.439
I want to do it with you.
- No.

00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:32.920
Why not?

00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:34.076
Honestly?
- Yeah.

00:14:34.760 --> 00:14:35.910
I can't be arsed, darling.

00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:40.510
I'm gonna go back to my room
and have one more martini

00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:41.880
and if you need anything

00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:43.439
call me.

00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:44.440
Anything.

00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:48.715
You can have whoever you want
at your age.

00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:50.200
Except the Best Woman in Business.

00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:53.313
Well, that's just cos she's... exhausted.

00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:55.709
33 isn't exactly...

00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:57.871
And what had Jesus done by 33?

00:14:58.240 --> 00:14:59.119
Died?

00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:01.271
Exactly. So get out there and flirt.

00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:12.760
Here you are.

00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:15.031
Oh, hi.
- Thought you might be snogging Finland.

00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:16.639
Ha. No, I, uh...

00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:18.154
Just, uh, sorting a few things.

00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:19.840
I got her.
- Oh.

00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:23.039
And Belinda gave me her card.
- Oh, that's great.

00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:25.675
What?
- Nothing.

00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:27.560
She's furious.

00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:29.520
Really?
- Yes.

00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:30.790
It was a great night.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:32.639
Everything went smoothly
in the end

00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:34.677
and everyone loved the canapés.

00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:35.956
Really?
I'm a dead woman.

00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:37.639
Really?
- Yes.

00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:39.200
Really?

00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:40.879
Yes. It was a great night.

00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:42.880
She's gonna blow.
I just have a feeling...

00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:44.758
I would have come up
with my own joke

00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:46.473
if you hadn't put that one
in my head.

00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:48.712
I have my own jokes.

00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:51.156
I am funny, I am interesting.

00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:53.392
I knew I shouldn't have
brought you here.

00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:55.136
What do you mean "interesting"?
- You just think you can do

00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:57.391
whatever you like,
say whatever you like

00:15:57.760 --> 00:15:59.831
steal whatever you like,
kiss whoever you like.

00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:01.877
He kissed me!
- Oh, I know!

00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:03.956
You know?

00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:06.336
Then why have we been spending the entire...
- Because you're fine.

00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:09.000
You'll always be fine,
you'll always be interesting

00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:11.800
with your quirky café
and your dead best friend.

00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:13.998
You just make me feel
like I've failed.

00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:18.359
Claire...

00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:21.239
If you mention the size
of my office, I will scream.

00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:24.756
It's huge.

00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:30.234
I just thought
we were hanging out.

00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:32.836
Just as friends.

00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:35.476
We're not friends.

00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:37.235
We are sisters.

00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:40.956
Get your own friends.

00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:03.193
Oh, hi.
- Oh, sorry.

00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:04.936
I didn't have your number,
and you just said

00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:06.280
come round anytime with G&amp;Ts.

00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:08.399
Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure.
I just, uh...

00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:10.936
This is a bit embarrassing,
but recently I've been

00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:13.475
really enjoying
going to bed at 9:30.

00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:15.200
Oh, shit.
- No, it's fine.

00:17:15.560 --> 00:17:16.789
I can see G&amp;T...
Are you OK?

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.640
Yeah, yeah, I just-just fancied
a drink and a priest

00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:20.836
and a chat, maybe.

00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:22.350
Oh, that's my whole job.

00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:24.136
We'll have to be quiet though

00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:25.160
because Pam's a bit of a

00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:27.471
sound tyrant in the evenings.

00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:28.600
Pam lives here?

00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:30.074
Yeah, Pam lives here.

00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:36.031
- So, I read your book.
- OK, great.

00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:37.680
Well, it's got some great twists.
- True.

00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:39.439
Uh, but I just, I couldn't help

00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:40.576
but notice...
- Come on, just spit it out.

00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:42.637
...just one or two
little inconsistencies.

00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:43.880
OK, sure.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:45.878
So, the world was made
in seven days

00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:48.073
and on the first day,
light came

00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:50.720
and then, a few days later,
the sun came.

00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:53.636
Yeah, that's ridiculous.

00:17:53.800 --> 00:17:55.439
But you believe that.

00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:58.593
But it's not fact.
It's poetry, it's moral code.

00:17:58.760 --> 00:18:00.479
It's for interpretation
to help us work out

00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:01.875
God's plan for us.

00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:03.916
What's God's plan for you?

00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:07.160
I believe God meant for me
to love people

00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:09.433
in a... different way.

00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:11.910
I believe I'm supposed
to love people as a father.

00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:13.960
We can arrange that.

00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:16.078
A father of many.

00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:18.080
I'll go up to three.
- It's not gonna happen.

00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:19.634
Two, then.
- OK, two.

00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:25.474
Oh, shit, Pam.
She's not happy.

00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:27.074
We should go outside.

00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:32.256
Do you think I should become a Catholic?

00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:33.350
No, don't do that.

00:18:33.560 --> 00:18:35.870
I like that you believe
in a meaningless existence.

00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:38.237
And you're good for me, you make me

00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:39.670
question my faith.

00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:42.312
And?
- I've never felt closer to God.

00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:44.279
Fuck you.

00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:45.800
What was that?

00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:47.736
It wasn't a fox, was it?
- I don't know.

00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:49.877
Was it a fox?
Shine something. Boo! Baa!

00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:52.000
- Oh, God, I bet it's a fox.
- Oh, God.

00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:54.549
No, I'm not being funny,
foxes have been after me for years.

00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:56.240
It's like they have a pact or something.

00:18:56.400 --> 00:18:58.596
I'm not kidding. I was on a toilet

00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:00.672
a toilet of a train,
and when the train stopped

00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:02.256
a fucking fox tried
to get through the window.

00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:04.556
Of a train!
Its face was in the window.

00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:06.911
And once,
when I was at a monastery

00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:08.536
I woke up just feeling a bit weird

00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:10.870
like there might be a fox about,
and a fox was sitting

00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:13.429
underneath my window,
looking at me like this.

00:19:13.960 --> 00:19:16.600
Pointing at me like,
"You... we're watching you.

00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:17.800
We're having you."

00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:21.830
Lucky God got there first.

00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:24.157
Well, yeah.
- You could be a fox boy by now.

00:19:24.280 --> 00:19:26.280
And we all know what happened to them.

00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:30.875
You OK?
- I'm OK.

00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:34.356
Do you think I'm mad?

00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:36.760
Because of the fox thing
or cos of the God thing?

00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:38.713
You're obsessed.

00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:41.800
Do you ever have doubts?

00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:45.554
Yes, of course. Every day.
It's part of the deal.

00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:48.160
I just don't think
I could do it.

00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:50.480
Especially as a...

00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:54.720
What?

00:19:55.240 --> 00:19:56.469
Celibacy and...

00:19:56.560 --> 00:19:57.560
Oh, it's a fucking fox!

00:19:57.640 --> 00:19:58.790
Chill out about the fox.

00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:01.759
Oh, sorry. I just don't know
what they want from me.

00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:05.116
Sorry.

00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:07.280
Celibacy.

00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:08.640
Go.

00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:11.040
I just...

00:20:12.520 --> 00:20:14.273
I couldn't give up sex forever.

00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:16.836
It's just too...

00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:19.320
too...

00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:21.880
Celibacy...

00:20:22.760 --> 00:20:25.116
is a lot less complicated than...

00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:27.360
romantic relationships.

00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:29.714
What if you meet
someone you like?

00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:34.033
I talk and drink and laugh
and give them Bibles

00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:35.793
and hope they eventually
leave me alone.

00:20:37.080 --> 00:20:38.480
What if you meet
someone you love?

00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:43.350
We're not gonna have sex.

00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:51.720
I know that's what you think
you want from me, but it's not.

00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:55.031
It won't bring any good.

00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:57.193
- Well, it might.
- It won't.

00:20:58.280 --> 00:20:59.760
I've been there many times...

00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:01.796
before I found this.

00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:02.990
Many, many times.

00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:04.790
How many times?

00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:10.676
Many.

00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:23.598
I'd really like to be your friend, though.

00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:26.000
I'd like to be your friend, too.

00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:29.680
We'll last a week.

00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:32.600
What was that?

00:21:34.840 --> 00:21:35.876
What?

00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:38.159
Where'd you...
where'd you just go?

00:21:39.320 --> 00:21:40.320
What?

00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:43.191
You just... went somewhere.

00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:46.120
There. There.

00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:50.440
Where'd you just go?

00:21:51.640 --> 00:21:52.640
Nowhere.

00:21:58.240 --> 00:21:59.310
OK.
