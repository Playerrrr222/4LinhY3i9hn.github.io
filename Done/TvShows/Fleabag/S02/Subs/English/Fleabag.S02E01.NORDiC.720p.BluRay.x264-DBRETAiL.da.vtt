00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:09.673
I opened a café with my friend Boo.

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:11.759
Yeah, she's dead now.

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:12.896
Thank you for coming in today...

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:15.230
That kind of thing won't get you
very far here anymore.

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:17.880
I suppose you should meet Hilary.

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:20.396
She's beautiful!

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:21.869
Mum died three years ago.

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:23.800
Loo, doo, ooh, badoo!

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:24.840
Alright, Dad?

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:27.236
Dad's way of coping
with two motherless daughters

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:28.936
was to buy us tickets to feminist lectures

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.160
start fucking our Godmother
and eventually stop calling.

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:33.040
Did you take the sculpture?
- What sculpture?

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:36.760
Martin's being lovely.

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:38.997
I am not drunk.
- Always drunk.

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:40.873
Jake's her step-son, he's really weird.

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.196
Probably clinically
but no one really talk about that.

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:44.319
No!

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:45.549
I go the Finland promotion.

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.034
That's amazing!
- Thank you.

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.280
People make mistakes.

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.154
Your husband tried to kiss me
on your birthday.

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:54.235
I've just got to say this once.

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:55.714
He didn't try to kiss you.

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:57.576
He says it was like more like
the other way around.

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.956
You have to believe me!
- How can I believe you?

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.480
Because I'm your sister.

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.000
After what you did to Boo?

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.878
I'm sorry.

No, thank you.

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:51.756
They've gone.

This is a love story.

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.358
You know when you've done everything?

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:19.914
When you've been all...
- Squat!

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:21.394
Squat!
- Squat!

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:22.440
And...

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:25.360
You've even...

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:26.960
Do you wanna have sex?

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:28.560
No.

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.234
Can I at least go down on you?

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:32.480
No!

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:34.877
You've done everything

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.559
and you feel great.

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:38.679
You're not even thinking about...

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:40.389
You don't even think about...

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.600
And even though your sister
still hates you...

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:44.917
Thank you.
- You're pretending to be friends

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:45.960
because your dad is...

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.831
I'm joking, he's just there.
- Here's to love.

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:51.160
And engaged.

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.237
To love!
- To love.

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:54.953
Ayyy!

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.000
Eugh.

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.078
Congratulations, you assholes.

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:13.237
So, uh, it means a great deal to both of us

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:16.079
that, uh you... that we...

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:18.431
the family, are... are... uh...

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:20.280
are all...

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:21.994
together here for, uh...

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.480
For a very special family...

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:27.990
gang bang.

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.311
It's just, you know, being here...

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.438
You know, I know we've had our...

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:39.110
Cos I-I...

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:41.232
I have the feeling, um...

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:42.840
in...

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:44.750
here.

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:46.833
Th-That... So, I just want to...

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:48.720
say...

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:52.280
Very much.

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:56.520
And that's it.

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:57.639
Oh, darling.

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:58.790
Aww!
- Congratulations, Dad!

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:00.354
Congratulations.
- Cheers.

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.039
May these be the worst of our days.

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:04.670
Don't know who this guy is.

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:07.235
Happy for you, old boy.
Best decision a man can make.

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:08.600
Ugh.

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:10.759
You look well.
- Thank you.

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:12.473
Right, wine, everyone?

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:14.976
We'd love some wine, please.
- Oh, you'll adore it, I chose it.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.320
Not for us, thanks.

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:18.916
Off the sauce!
- Six months and counting.

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:21.031
Why would you do that?
- We just...

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:23.400
Don't wanna miss a thing.
- Enjoy each other more this way.

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:26.230
Haven't seen her since...

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:28.756
Except for...

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:31.399
Nice jumpsuit.
- Thank you.

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:32.960
You look well, where've you been?

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:34.160
Boots.

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:35.920
It's lovely there this time of year.

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:40.114
Oh, you look fantastic.

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:43.119
Oh, well, you both look gorgeous!
- Oh, thank you.

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:44.160
Is that fur?

00:04:44.161 --> 00:04:47.073
Yes, but it's OK because it had a stroke.

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:48.190
Oh, lovely!

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:52.391
I can't go to hell for that, can I, Father?
- No.

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:55.109
Not as long as you confess.
- Oh, God, he's their priest.

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:56.496
Then you've nothing
to fucking worry about!

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:57.795
Their cool, sweary priest.

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:59.991
Love the Catholics!
You can get away with anything.

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:01.315
A lot of them did!

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:05.070
It's an honour to be marrying you two.
Thank you.

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:07.919
I didn't realise you were allowed out
without your little doggy thing.

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:11.239
Oh, sorry, have I disappointed you?
- Of course not.

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:12.400
Devastated.

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:13.795
Can I get you another bottle?

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:15.599
Needy waitress.
- Ah, no, it's alright.

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:17.996
We've already ordered wine.
- Oh, no, really?

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:19.720
I'll have another tequila.

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:21.080
I'll have a tequila.

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:22.200
Great, thank you so much.

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:25.399
Can I get a glass of sparkling water
with a dash of lime, please?

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:27.558
Oh, yes, I'll have the same.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.559
Dream team.

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:32.794
You know, the most fascinating thing
about Father here

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:35.197
is that his mother was originally a lesbi...

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:46.752
- Is everyone OK?
- You do look tired.

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:49.240
Oh, it's not as exhausting
as I thought it would be, actually.

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:50.875
She's commuting from Finland.

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:54.795
She has narrowed down her packing
to a ten-minute turnaround, it's...

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.514
It's fabulous!
- It's all about...

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:58.433
Rolling it up, rather than...
- Folding it.

00:05:58.480 --> 00:05:59.800
I read about that.

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:02.230
Are you sure you don't want any wine?

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:03.430
No, thank you.

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:06.712
It really is delicious.
I admire you both so much.

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:08.736
Well, it's really turned us around,
hasn't it, honey?

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:10.194
Oh, so much more energy.

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:11.280
You know, in Finland...

00:06:11.281 --> 00:06:13.576
Is there a reason that you're not drinking?
- He's an alcoholic.

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:15.239
Oh, fun, my parents are alcoholics.

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:16.199
Oh, great.

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:18.112
We thought it'd be easier
if we did it together.

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:20.880
And I don't really like the taste.
- And we are trying for a baby.

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:25.550
Oh, Claire!
We thought you couldn't have them.

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:27.398
What, why?
- Well, you just seem a little...

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:31.190
Well, they say a lifestyle change can help,
so here we go.

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:33.436
That is so exciting, darling.

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:35.000
Oh, thanks, Dad.
- Good luck.

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:36.110
That's wonderful.

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:37.816
Something's up.
- And now you have the money

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:38.840
to pay for proper help.

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:40.998
Ghastly without help, I imagine.

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:42.876
Tell us about Finland.

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:44.475
Oh, well, it's, um...

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:47.156
Cold and beautiful and dark.

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:48.830
I think she might be happy.

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:50.519
It's a lot of pressure but I love it.

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:53.456
I have this amazing new partner out there,
he's really pushed the company forw...

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:55.696
D'you know, I can't remember
the last time we went away.

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:57.951
Weren't you both in Japan recently?

00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.320
Japan, wow.

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:01.160
Oh, yes, but that was just
a little fortnight.

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:03.158
- Don't ask her.
- Why were you in Japan?

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:04.880
Well, the...
- I was... Oh, sorry, darling.

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:06.276
Oh, no, no. No.

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:07.640
Thank you. Erm...

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:09.956
They flew us over with the Sexhibition.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.416
Yes, really made it...
- And... sorry, darling.

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:12.920
Do you want to...?
- No, no, no.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.435
No? Oh. You see, you think of the Japanese

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:17.736
as a very prudish people...
- Well, we're not to generalise.

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:20.878
But actually they have a very deep
interest in sex in their culture.

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:23.776
It's just hidden in the underbelly,
it's not allowed to come to the surface.

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:25.536
- Fair enough.
- They really appreciate...

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:27.216
The honesty of the Sexhibition,
whereas the...

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:28.560
The Americans.
- The Americans...

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:29.856
Well, they just took me in their stride.

00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:32.793
But the Japanese were deeply moved
by my work ethic

00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:34.000
weren't they, darling?
- Yeah.

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:36.277
It caused quite a cultural wave.
- Ripple.

00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:38.549
Rip... w-wave.

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:39.559
Wave.

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:42.195
No one's asked me a question in 45 minutes.
- So what do you do?

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:48.310
Er, I run a café.

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:50.035
Oh, wow!

00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:51.510
It's going well, is it?

00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:54.673
Yes, it is. It really is.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:56.000
It actually is.

00:07:58.640 --> 00:07:59.640
It is.

00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:04.433
Can I get anyone any ice?

00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:24.520
Fellow smoker.

00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:26.518
Do you have a spare one?
- Sure.

00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:37.318
So, do your family get together much, or...?

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:40.200
Fuck you, then.

00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:54.280
We should wait.

00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:56.720
OK.

00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:03.280
Mm.

00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:09.760
He's such a lovely man.

00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:11.439
Yes.

00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:12.480
Did you have a cigarette?

00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:14.352
Yeah.
- I just wish you could've seen him...

00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:16.198
Yeah, they can't even masturbate.

00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:18.038
- Shit alive, man.
- Oh, sorry.

00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:19.680
- No, no.
- Hey!

00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:23.276
We were just saying, it's fascinating,
the notion of a calling.

00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:26.394
Yeah, well, marriage is a calling too,
of course.

00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:29.035
Did you always want to join the priesthood?
- Oh, fuck, no.

00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:33.073
Sorry.

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:34.079
No, no, no.

00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:37.710
I came quite late to it, actually,
but it's been a really good life to me.

00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:40.275
I've really found peace in it.

00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:43.836
Is anyone in your family in the Church?
- Actually, both my parents are lawyers

00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:45.720
and my brother
is a long-distance lorry driver.

00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:48.351
How unusual! Are your parents successful?

00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:50.797
They were very successful alcoholics, yeah.

00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:54.118
Better than you, anyway.
- Ha-ha!

00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:55.390
No, but beyond them

00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:59.594
my family's literally crawling with nuns,
so it wasn't too much of a leap.

00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:00.950
Must be hard on the balls.

00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:02.600
Martin!

00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:05.520
Not as hard on them as trying
to make a baby for five months, I imagine.

00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:08.759
- Food good?
- This sauce is disgusting.

00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:11.316
Is everything OK?
- Oh, it's delicious, thank you.

00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:12.760
- Thank you.
- Lovely, lovely.

00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:17.356
Um, darling?
- No, no.

00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:19.517
We'll just pour our own wine, please.

00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:21.797
Oh, I actually love doing...
- Thank you.

00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:23.752
You can pour me some.
- Oh, thank you.

00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:27.076
So, do you do a lot of older weddings?

00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:28.474
I don't think that's how we...

00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:30.716
No, this is my first ever wedding, actually.

00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:31.989
Oh!

00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:35.953
D'you know, I've always been so suspicious
of religion but I must say

00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:39.438
I think there's something rather chic
about having a real priest at a wedding.

00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:41.440
Are you a real priest?

00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:44.040
Yeah.

00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:48.555
D'you know, it's so nice spending time
getting to know the man

00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:50.398
who's going to marry us.
- Is that usual?

00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:54.119
No, but I'm new to the parish

00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:55.799
and I guess I'm just...

00:10:56.880 --> 00:10:59.031
I'm really fucking lonely!

00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:00.520
So...

00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:02.392
So I appreciate this.
Thank you very much.

00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:03.510
New to the parish?

00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:08.113
Father Patrick sadly died, so I got the gig.

00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:12.110
What did he die of?
- Just, um, time.

00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:13.840
Oh.

00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:16.879
But he was a dedicated man,
he was a brilliant priest.

00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:18.160
Sounds like a riot.

00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:20.877
He was, actually.

00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:26.880
Do you know how we met?

00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:28.439
No.

00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:29.440
Through Jake.

00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:30.880
Creepy step-son.

00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:32.952
- He plays the flute.
- The bassoon.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.834
In the church band. Just adorable!

00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:38.760
And Claire introduced us
and we just hit it off.

00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:40.594
Didn't we?
- We did, yeah.

00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:41.640
They did.

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:45.676
She's donating a painting for the fete,
it's gonna cause quite the stir.

00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:47.313
Oh, it's just an old one, but...

00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:50.914
Now, listen, um,
we don't want gifts at the wedding.

00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:54.671
I mean, it's enough that people slog it over
without then expecting a gift.

00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:57.680
So we've decided to ask people
to make a small donation

00:11:57.960 --> 00:12:00.316
to a charity of their choosing, in our name.

00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:01.640
That sounds lovely.

00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:04.856
Do you want to know what gift
I'm giving your father?

00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:06.394
Oh, God.
- It's a portrait.

00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:08.353
Oh, God.
- Of you girls.

00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:09.716
Oh, God. Erm...

00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:12.832
Do you mean...?
- Together, or, erm...?

00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:14.594
I'd only need a couple of sittings.

00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:16.279
Right. Can't you use photos?

00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:18.073
No, because the lighting's
never good enough

00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:20.589
and if you're not very photogenic
then it does you no favours.

00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:22.479
And besides, the only photos there are

00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:24.557
of you two together
are of when you were children

00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:26.120
and you looked like a boy, so...

00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:30.194
You never told me you had a sister, Claire.
- Oh, well, we, um...

00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:32.472
We don't get to see each other much.

00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:35.277
Do you see your brother?

00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:38.757
Oh, I don't really speak to my brother.
- Oh, God, how desperately sad!

00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:39.800
Why is that?

00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:42.719
Oh, erm, well...
- You don't have to...

00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:43.679
No, no, it's OK.

00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:45.496
Does he not approve of what you do,
of your choices?

00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:47.776
No, it's not that, it's not that.
- Is he not in the Church?

00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:50.235
No, he's not in the Church.
- Oh, it must be so hard!

00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:52.256
Well, it's mainly hard...
- Is it cos he's Mummy's favourite?

00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:53.555
Because he's a paedophile.

00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:57.160
Oh.

00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:05.120
I'm aware of the irony of that.

00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:23.475
Just a... just a breath of air, eh?

00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:26.549
Interesting man.

00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:27.960
Mm.

00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:30.960
No, thanks.

00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:37.592
Darling, I, uh...
I'm sorry I missed your birthday

00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:38.960
so I just...
- Oh, that's OK.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.390
No, no. I just... In case you're struggling.

00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:45.394
Oh, Dad, the café's going well.
- No, no, this is not for work.

00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:47.120
It's just for you.

00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:50.920
Thanks.

00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:55.630
You look, er...

00:13:57.560 --> 00:13:58.560
strong.

00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:00.519
Thanks.
- Are you?

00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:04.916
Are we gonna have a fight?
- No, no! I'm sorry, no.

00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:09.034
I just want to check that that you're...
that you and I are...

00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:13.312
Well, you're being very...

00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:16.514
You're not being naughty.

00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:19.350
No!
- Why?

00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:23.117
Oh. Because, I guess...

00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:24.280
Yeah?

00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:26.560
It doesn't matter.

00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:33.280
Oh.

00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:36.359
OK.

00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:37.360
Is that right?

00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:42.836
I'm happy for you, Dad.

00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:47.240
Thank you.

00:14:56.640 --> 00:14:58.677
Ah! Thank you.

00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:00.120
You're an exceptional waitress.

00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:01.800
Apple juice?

00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:04.040
Yeah.

00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:08.317
I... I just wanted to say

00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:14.831
I am so intrigued to see how you're going to
make this whole evening about yourself.

00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:19.800
Oh, no.

00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:23.231
We probably shouldn't arrive
at the table together.

00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:29.638
A lot of people would say praying
is just talking to yourself in the dark.

00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:32.320
I guess it could look like that, but...

00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:36.157
No, it's more just about connecting
with yourself at the end of each day.

00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:39.238
It takes a bit of effort, but...
- Yes, yes, I completely agree.

00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:40.794
Positive energy takes work.
- Yes.

00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:42.718
In the last six months, I've excelled.

00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:44.194
I take all the negative emotions

00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:46.560
and just bottle them and bury them
and they never come out.

00:15:46.680 --> 00:15:48.680
I'm not sure...
- I've basically never been better.

00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:51.275
Us neither.
- I feel fantastic!

00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:53.816
- You're a very positive family, I must say.
- Oh, absolutely.

00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:55.320
I think it's all about positivity.

00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:57.192
It takes real commitment to be this happy.

00:15:57.240 --> 00:15:59.550
It's not just about
eating and drinking well, either.

00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:01.816
Putting pine nuts on your salad
doesn't make you a grown-up.

00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:03.513
Fucking does.
- It's about...

00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:07.158
Well, in Finland, we, um...
they have this saying

00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:09.556
which I can't quite remember now,
it's, um...

00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:13.476
It's about opening yourself up
to the people who want to love you.

00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:16.036
And she is wide open lately.

00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:18.596
What do you do?
- Oh, I work in finance.

00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:19.676
What?
- What?

00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:21.632
Across two firms,
one in Finland and one here.

00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:22.680
No, no, she's a lawyer.

00:16:22.681 --> 00:16:24.000
I thought you were a lawyer?
- No.

00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:25.040
What?

00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:27.232
I work with lawyers, I'm not a lawyer.

00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:28.999
Darling, you are a solicitor.

00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:30.759
I went to business school.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:32.639
You're being so quiet!

00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:34.080
Why aren't you saying anything?

00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:41.156
What do you want me to say?
- Anything!

00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:43.230
What's that in your hand?

00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:45.576
She doesn't need to tell you.
- Birthday present from Dad.

00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:46.670
It's a good thing, Claire.

00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:47.999
Chunk of change?

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:49.320
No, it's, er...

00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:50.476
- What is it?
- Dunno.

00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:52.989
You don't need to...
- I love presents, I never get presents.

00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:55.350
Well, it's because you might...
- It's a voucher.

00:16:55.760 --> 00:16:56.955
For a counselling session.

00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:01.353
Thanks, Dad.

00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:03.717
So thoughtful!
- I'd kill for one of those.

00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:05.496
I don't believe you can pay
your problems away

00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:08.274
I think you have to face who you are
and suffer the consequences.

00:17:08.320 --> 00:17:09.600
It's the only road to happiness.

00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:12.600
Maybe happiness isn't in what you believe
but who you believe.

00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:23.760
Fuck. Excuse me.

00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:29.756
- Oh! Do you think she needs anything?
- No.

00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:37.397
That was meant to be a bedroom present.

00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:38.559
A what?

00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:41.513
A present that you open
in your bedroom, alone.

00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:43.871
All my presents are bedroom presents,
aren't they?

00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:46.237
Do you want some more wine?

00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:47.320
Oh, yes.
- No.

00:17:56.520 --> 00:17:57.520
Claire?

00:17:58.200 --> 00:17:59.200
You've been ages.

00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:01.520
Are you pissed off
or are you doing a poo?

00:18:02.840 --> 00:18:03.840
Fuck.

00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:05.240
Fuck it.

00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:07.150
Claire, can we just...?

00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:10.434
Have you got a sanitary towel?

00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:14.430
Oh, no, but I know a waitress
who would jump on that request.

00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:15.960
Do you want me to ask her?
- No!

00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:19.631
OK, well, there are some
sturdy hand towels here.

00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:22.798
Could try and fashion something
with wings out of these.

00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:24.640
Yes, fine.

00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:26.080
Open the door.

00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:29.997
The fuck! Just give it! Fuck!

00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:33.317
Give it to me! Don't come in!
- It's a period! It's not gonna bite me!

00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:36.440
Don't look at it!
- I'm not looking at your period!

00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:37.550
Just take this...

00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:39.474
Oh, God.
- It's not a period

00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:40.920
it's a fucking miscarriage, OK?

00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:46.360
Jesus, Claire!

00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:47.989
It's OK.

00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:49.576
No, it's not OK,
you need to go to a hospital!

00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:51.478
It's fine, I just need...

00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:52.590
Let me just...
- No!

00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:55.519
Just get your hands off my miscarriage!

00:18:58.440 --> 00:18:59.440
It's mine.

00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:02.590
It's mine.

00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:22.200
OK.

00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:25.080
Claire.

00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:28.080
It's OK.

00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:29.400
It's OK.

00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:31.394
OK, we need to go to a hospital now.

00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:33.880
Now.

00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:38.680
Yes.

00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:41.273
OK.
- OK.

00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:43.550
OK.
- OK.

00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:48.790
Come on.
- It's...

00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:50.470
It's all good.
- OK.

00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:53.794
Don't tell anyone.
- OK.

00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:56.936
Let's get the coats, I'll get a taxi.
- I'll tell them I don't feel right.

00:19:56.960 --> 00:19:57.879
OK.
- Thank you.

00:19:57.880 --> 00:19:58.880
OK.

00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:01.776
I've never been there,
I get antiques from there all the time.

00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:02.759
I still haven't gone.
- Oh, really?

00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:04.736
I can understand, it's a wonderful
place to buy things like that...

00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:10.640
I don't like all the water, I'd love it if...
- Fuck it, I'm having some.

00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:14.954
Sorry, darling.
- Oh, good girl! Have one night off.

00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:17.118
Oh, wow! What did you say to her?

00:20:17.560 --> 00:20:20.758
I, um...
- Oh, nothing. I just, er, just sit down.

00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:21.870
Come on, it's a party.

00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:22.920
Can I have some?

00:20:22.921 --> 00:20:25.913
Oh, someone's suddenly getting
into the party spirit now!

00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:26.960
Sit down!

00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:28.880
What did you take in there?

00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:31.435
Your sister is finally
a good influence on you.

00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:34.678
No, we just suddenly realised
what a monumental fucking day this is!

00:20:35.080 --> 00:20:36.039
Drink.

00:20:36.040 --> 00:20:37.616
Honestly, just leave them in there
two minutes

00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:39.996
and they're suddenly being teenagers again.

00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:41.554
Shall I get another bottle?
- Yes!

00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:42.600
OK!

00:20:42.601 --> 00:20:44.990
Where's the waitress?
- We were just talking about Venice

00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:46.440
and this wonderful trip we had.

00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:48.736
I mean, how many times have we said
we have to go to Venice?

00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:51.070
I've always wanted to go there.
Top of my list.

00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:52.600
It's great.
- Yeah, I know.

00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:54.871
Oh, for fuck's sake, stop it!

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:01.000
Are you OK?

00:21:02.560 --> 00:21:03.710
Yeah, I'm, er...

00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:07.715
Er...
- Is, um... is it?

00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:09.196
No, I'm sorry, I just...

00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:10.920
Here we go.

00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:12.216
Sorry, I just...
- What's happened?

00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:13.536
Nothing's happened.
- What's happened?

00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:14.596
Something's happened.

00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:16.793
Come on! Come on.

00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:18.672
Well, spit it out.
- No secrets here.

00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:21.280
I just had a little... I just had...

00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:23.478
This is a safe space.
- I just...

00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:26.592
I had a little miscarriage.

00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:33.559
Oh, my God.

00:21:33.560 --> 00:21:34.914
What?
- Um...

00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:36.676
What the fuck?

00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:38.837
Er...
- How far gone were you?

00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:40.496
You should go to the hospital.
- Whose was it?

00:21:40.520 --> 00:21:42.496
Maybe leave that for later.
- Was it the tooth man?

00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:44.591
Hospital, now.
- What about the bill? Sit down.

00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:45.736
No, I'll cover her, I'll cover you.

00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:47.399
She doesn't want to go!
- Why?

00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:49.016
Cos I'm stubborn,
and for some inexplicable reason

00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:51.416
I'd rather stay here
and have a passive-aggressive party, so.

00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:53.716
How far gone were you?
- Oh, it was very early stages.

00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:56.036
You knew?
- I really think she should see a doctor.

00:21:56.080 --> 00:21:57.912
Yeah, so do I.
- I thought you hadn't spoken?

00:21:57.960 --> 00:22:00.680
She's fine. She's absolutely fine!

00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:01.679
Drink.

00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:02.830
If it's gone, it's gone!

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:05.354
Claire...
- What if it's not gone?

00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:06.720
It's gone.

00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:08.712
- Darling, please...
- Probably ectopic.

00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:10.640
Awful.

00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:12.996
I'll pay you back.
- D'you need someone to go with you?

00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:15.256
No, I think I'll just deal with this
in my own insane, irrational

00:22:15.280 --> 00:22:16.316
anal way, if that's OK.

00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:18.839
That's probably for the best.

00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:21.277
What'd you say?
- Ignore him, he's been drinking.

00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:22.880
What?
- Just, you know...

00:22:22.920 --> 00:22:25.196
it's like a goldfish out the bowl,
sort of thing.

00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:27.296
If it didn't wanna be in there,
it didn't wanna be in there

00:22:27.320 --> 00:22:28.436
something wasn't right.

00:22:31.560 --> 00:22:32.560
What?

00:22:32.760 --> 00:22:35.992
It's the kid's choice
if it wants to jump ship, right?

00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:38.316
- No, Martin, just...
- Either way...

00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:41.155
she got her spotlight.

00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:48.559
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
- What the fuck?

00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:50.991
Fuck! Oh, fuck!

00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:54.319
Jeez... Jesus Chr...!
- Is there anything I can do?

00:22:57.440 --> 00:23:00.080
Fuck! Argh!
- Oh, for God's sake!

00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:15.670
Can I do anything?

00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:17.800
No, thank you.

00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:20.400
They've gone.

00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:22.600
So...

00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:29.640
Thank you.

00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:34.760
Fucking hell.

00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:36.719
Oh, hey.

00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:38.473
Uh, I got your stuff.

00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:39.720
You OK?
- Thanks.

00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:41.360
Yeah, you OK?
- Yeah, yeah.

00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:46.318
If you ever need someone to talk to,
or, you know, be there...

00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:49.800
I'm always there.

00:24:08.040 --> 00:24:09.040
Hey!

00:24:09.840 --> 00:24:10.840
Hey!

00:24:25.960 --> 00:24:26.960
Thank you.

00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:29.960
Just tell him where you live
and we'll talk about this tomorrow.

00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:33.136
Can you take us
to the nearest hospital, please?

00:24:33.160 --> 00:24:34.160
Yeah.

00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:52.749
The priest is quite hot.

00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:53.800
So hot.
