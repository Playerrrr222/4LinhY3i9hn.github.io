WEBVTT

00:01:13.156 --> 00:01:14.449
Baby?

00:01:14.449 --> 00:01:15.700
Sorry, Dad.

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:01.871
Can I?

00:02:05.625 --> 00:02:08.711
I was looking at your COGS.
You're right.

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.422
Check average gets killed at night.

00:02:12.841 --> 00:02:15.593
Price is too low. Barely covers labor.

00:02:16.594 --> 00:02:17.804
Sandwiches at night.

00:02:17.929 --> 00:02:19.556
- Killer.
- Total killer.

00:02:22.392 --> 00:02:24.018
We need a new dinner menu.

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:25.520
Hundred percent.

00:02:28.731 --> 00:02:33.570
For the new menu, I was thinking,
maybe a play on "Tongue and Cheek?"

00:02:34.445 --> 00:02:35.530
Ox tongue?

00:02:35.864 --> 00:02:40.827
Or braised beef, maybe short rib.
And risotto.

00:02:42.662 --> 00:02:44.414
Well, maybe.

00:02:44.914 --> 00:02:47.458
Man, this book is wild.

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:49.127
Yo, you just get here?

00:02:49.127 --> 00:02:51.921
Nah. Chefs, we got any non-iodized salt?

00:02:52.005 --> 00:02:53.882
Yeah, in the walk-in.
How we doing on cakes?

00:02:53.882 --> 00:02:56.509 line:20%
- About to fire 'em up.
- Please hustle on that, all right?

00:02:56.593 --> 00:02:57.594 line:20%
I got you.

00:02:58.928 --> 00:03:00.638 line:20%
Sorry, just, scissors.

00:03:00.722 --> 00:03:01.890 line:20%
For what?

00:03:02.432 --> 00:03:05.935 line:20%
One side looks like shit.
Both sides look like shit in here.

00:03:06.561 --> 00:03:07.812 line:20%
Yes, Chef.

00:03:13.026 --> 00:03:14.027
The fuck was that?

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:27.749
I know what this is. Fuck!

00:03:28.458 --> 00:03:31.169
This is fucked.
We need to close for lunch.

00:03:31.169 --> 00:03:33.880
No. No, no, no, we lose one service,
it will kill us.

00:03:34.756 --> 00:03:38.176
You don't think this is putting it
at risk for losing a service? No?

00:03:38.176 --> 00:03:40.053
- No, this is fine.
- Cool. Good.

00:03:40.053 --> 00:03:43.723
Yo, Fak, yo, we need here ASAP, bro.
The toilet is fucked.

00:03:43.723 --> 00:03:46.309
Yo, what is good,
you fucking replicants?

00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:47.685
Toilet exploded.

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:50.313
- Yeah, what's up?
- Is that funny? Is that good?

00:03:50.313 --> 00:03:52.315
Tina, Sydney, Ebra,
you guys with me in the kitchen,

00:03:52.315 --> 00:03:54.317
we're gonna go over that
new menu still, okay?

00:03:54.317 --> 00:03:56.569
Marcus, desserts.
Please, thank you, Chef.

00:03:56.653 --> 00:04:00.490
Manny, Angel, cousin, just lock this
shit down, get it dried off.

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:02.116
Fak's bringing a shop-vac, okay?

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:03.576
Fak's mouth is a shop vac.

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:06.371
Oh, my God, you're so funny, Richie.

00:04:06.746 --> 00:04:09.249
All right, guys,
this is some next level shit.

00:04:09.249 --> 00:04:11.501
I'mma check out ground zero.

00:04:13.962 --> 00:04:18.091
Okay, so, see the shallots
and garlic starting to caramelize?

00:04:18.508 --> 00:04:22.303
All right, so we're gonna add a little
bit of capers and cook that.

00:04:22.387 --> 00:04:24.681
- Many components, Carmen.
- I know, just hear me out.

00:04:24.681 --> 00:04:26.808
We gotta get a new dinner menu,
we can hire more cooks

00:04:26.808 --> 00:04:28.184
and get more help around here.

00:04:28.268 --> 00:04:32.563
Okay, we're gonna add little bit
of white wine. Let that reduce.

00:04:33.022 --> 00:04:37.151
And then you got some hot stock,
let that deglaze the bottom of the pan.

00:04:37.235 --> 00:04:39.696
Okay, that's looking good.
You can turn the heat off now

00:04:39.696 --> 00:04:40.780
and we're going to <i>monter</i>

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:45.868
or we're going to whisk in about
two tablespoons of butter.

00:04:46.327 --> 00:04:48.204
You see it's starting
to get kinda glossy.

00:04:48.288 --> 00:04:50.206
That's that sauce that's
starting to happen.

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:55.295
And a little bit of pepper, salt,
squeeze of lemon, parsley.

00:05:00.383 --> 00:05:04.595
And now we're gonna spoon it out.
Nice and easy, take your time.

00:05:05.096 --> 00:05:06.806
T, you wanna try this?

00:05:06.931 --> 00:05:08.933
- Yeah, you know it, Jeff.
- Here you go.

00:05:17.608 --> 00:05:18.735
Good?

00:05:19.986 --> 00:05:21.821
- Good? Yes, Jeff.

00:05:22.113 --> 00:05:25.742
It smells so good in here. Fak Attack.
Yo, LaTrina?

00:05:25.742 --> 00:05:26.826
- Yo. LaTrina.
- LaTrina.

00:05:26.826 --> 00:05:29.912
Okay, okay, okay. Well,
we're gonna fix it. It's okay.

00:05:31.039 --> 00:05:34.792
And this one time when I was a kid,
I thought I saw a dragon.

00:05:34.876 --> 00:05:37.337
Just pay attention.
Don't strip the thread.

00:05:37.337 --> 00:05:39.547
I'm not stripping the thread.

00:05:43.009 --> 00:05:45.678
- Stop trying to fuck me.
- I'm not trying to fuck you, bro.

00:05:45.762 --> 00:05:48.806
Dude, that's a human resources
offence, dude.

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:51.184
Yeah? Guess what?
You're looking at human resources.

00:05:51.184 --> 00:05:52.477
- Really?
- Yeah.

00:05:56.356 --> 00:05:58.691
Carmy says he's down a couple of cooks.

00:05:59.108 --> 00:06:02.653
Do you think that I can apply
for that job application?

00:06:06.199 --> 00:06:10.620
"Yeasts in stasis, their microbiol..."
Yo, I really love science.

00:06:10.995 --> 00:06:12.246
Yo, is this warm enough?

00:06:12.789 --> 00:06:14.374
- Think so.
- Yo, check this shit.

00:06:14.374 --> 00:06:16.501
- What's up?
- Take a whiff.

00:06:17.502 --> 00:06:20.463
Oh, my God. Yo, should we do a bakery?

00:06:20.463 --> 00:06:22.173
Yeah. Just finish the instructions.

00:06:23.257 --> 00:06:27.178
"There are two ways to go about
lacto-fermentation." Facts.

00:06:27.804 --> 00:06:30.223
Yo, we need to go to Copenhagen
and fuck that place up.

00:06:30.223 --> 00:06:32.266
- What are the two ways?
- Okay.

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:34.352
"You can ferment
the raw product in either

00:06:34.352 --> 00:06:37.230
"a vacuum sealed plastic bag or..."

00:06:37.438 --> 00:06:38.856
- Yo, Carmy.
- Yo.

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:40.900
Can I borrow
a sous vide bag, Chef?

00:06:41.234 --> 00:06:43.277
- The fuck you doin'?
- Fermenting.

00:06:43.611 --> 00:06:45.696
- You know how to seal it?
- No, Chef.

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:47.073
We can learn.

00:06:47.532 --> 00:06:48.866
Okay, above the locker.

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:51.661
- Thanks, Chef Carmy.
- Welcome, Chester.

00:06:51.661 --> 00:06:52.870
My guy.

00:06:52.954 --> 00:06:55.248
Yo, what time you home tonight?
Should I save <i>Bachelorette?</i>

00:06:55.248 --> 00:06:58.209
I'mma be late. Just watch it without me.
But, hey, don't ruin that shit again.

00:06:58.209 --> 00:07:00.253
I didn't ruin shit.
You asked me what happened.

00:07:00.253 --> 00:07:02.505
Yeah, and you told me every detail
of the whole episode.

00:07:02.505 --> 00:07:04.090
Then don't ask me what happened.

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:06.634
Marcus, we good on cakes, Chef?
Please don't get lost in that shit.

00:07:06.634 --> 00:07:08.052
- We good, Chef.
- I trust you.

00:07:08.136 --> 00:07:11.055
Marcus is Minnie Minoso
of Illinois Fermentation.

00:07:11.139 --> 00:07:12.306
Who's Minnie Minoso?

00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:13.683
- Mr. White Sox.
- Mr. White Sox.

00:07:13.808 --> 00:07:15.017
I guess he was good.

00:07:15.101 --> 00:07:16.894
First Black player for the White Sox.

00:07:17.103 --> 00:07:22.066
Stole 167 bases, 195 home runs,
and 1100 RBIs

00:07:22.483 --> 00:07:25.278
and a career batting average of 300,
so, not bad.

00:07:25.278 --> 00:07:27.738
- Two hours to service, Chefs.
- Yes, Chef.

00:07:27.822 --> 00:07:29.949
- Hey, how we looking up front?
- Shitty but better, Chef.

00:07:29.949 --> 00:07:31.033
I'll take that.

00:07:31.117 --> 00:07:32.910
Jeff, look at
the coloring on this.

00:07:33.411 --> 00:07:34.704
You wanna take that a bit darker.

00:07:34.704 --> 00:07:37.665
You see that brown spot? We wanna see
that everywhere on the bottom.

00:07:37.665 --> 00:07:40.084
That way when the stock hits,
you're gonna scrape up all that,

00:07:40.168 --> 00:07:41.961
that's gonna give that flavor,
the onion.

00:07:41.961 --> 00:07:43.588
When did Mikey make that for you?

00:07:43.588 --> 00:07:45.298
- Christmas.
- At my mom's?

00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:47.300
- Mmm-hmm.
- Still full psycho?

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:49.719
She wasn't calm, but the food was great.

00:07:49.844 --> 00:07:52.972
All right, looks good. Two more minutes,
add that stock. Okay, Chef?

00:07:52.972 --> 00:07:54.557
- All right, got it, Jeff.
- Thank you.

00:07:55.641 --> 00:07:57.560
- I graduated high school.
- Good start.

00:07:57.560 --> 00:07:59.937
- Be serious, man.
- I'm being serious.

00:08:00.021 --> 00:08:02.523
What might you bring to
The Beef as a new employee?

00:08:03.232 --> 00:08:05.026
- I got hearth.
- What's hearth?

00:08:05.026 --> 00:08:07.778
Heart... I'm nervous, man. I got heart.

00:08:07.862 --> 00:08:09.489
Ah. You're gonna need brain.

00:08:09.489 --> 00:08:12.492
Now, do you have any special skills
or abilities,

00:08:12.492 --> 00:08:13.951
asides from being a fuckin' stroke?

00:08:14.035 --> 00:08:17.747
Well, A, I'm not a fuckin' stroke,
and B, I'm really good on the keyboard.

00:08:17.747 --> 00:08:20.333
No, A, you are, and B, no, you're not.

00:08:20.333 --> 00:08:24.712
Well, A, yes, I am and B, I joined
a jazz fusion class. So, in your face.

00:08:24.712 --> 00:08:27.340
A, I've heard you fuckin' play
and you're fuckin' terrible,

00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:28.841
and C, it's a fuckin' restaurant.

00:08:28.925 --> 00:08:31.135
Why do I give a fuck that
you play the keyboard?

00:08:31.219 --> 00:08:34.430
I'm a hard worker. I'm a nice guy,
I got a great vibe...

00:08:34.514 --> 00:08:36.599
- Fuck your vibe.
- Don't ever fuck my vibe.

00:08:37.642 --> 00:08:40.269
I swear to God,
I will fuck anything I wanna fuck.

00:08:40.603 --> 00:08:43.648
You are not being nice,
and you will not fuck me. Mmm-mmm.

00:08:52.114 --> 00:08:54.033
Prick! Jesus fucking Christ.

00:08:54.033 --> 00:08:56.160
Stop shouting! Fuck!

00:08:56.244 --> 00:08:57.662
Get...

00:08:57.787 --> 00:08:59.080
Should I break it up?

00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:00.623
What's the point?

00:09:00.623 --> 00:09:02.416
Yo, yo, should I break this up?

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:04.460
- Yes! Yes!
- No. Say "Matae."

00:09:04.544 --> 00:09:06.170
No way! Never!

00:09:06.546 --> 00:09:07.547
That's cool.

00:09:07.547 --> 00:09:09.465
- I'm winning. You're such a bitch.
- Fuck!

00:09:09.549 --> 00:09:12.885
- Say "Matae."
- You're so mean. My nipple!

00:09:12.969 --> 00:09:14.303
- Yo, should I break this up?
- Yeah!

00:09:14.387 --> 00:09:15.930
- No!
- Yes!

00:09:17.598 --> 00:09:20.351
Hey! What the fuck, Carmy?

00:09:20.351 --> 00:09:22.311
Hey, guys, can you
shut the fuck up, please?

00:09:22.395 --> 00:09:26.607
He's mean. He is fucking not nice.
He is a fucking asshole.

00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:29.694
I wasn't even gonna say this.

00:09:29.694 --> 00:09:32.655
He is selling fucking coke
in the back alley of The Beef.

00:09:32.655 --> 00:09:36.158
Wait, wait, wait, what?
Stop! What? Fak!

00:09:36.242 --> 00:09:39.704
He is selling coke around the fucking
alleyway, man. I didn't wanna say it.

00:09:39.829 --> 00:09:42.832
Are you happy now that you told Mom,
you fucking stroke?

00:09:42.832 --> 00:09:45.876
Mommy knows now.
Fuck you. You're such an asshole.

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:49.088
I see you. I fuckin' see you, Neil Jeff.

00:09:56.178 --> 00:09:57.555
Okay. All right.

00:10:08.983 --> 00:10:10.610
- Oh, shit.

00:10:27.376 --> 00:10:28.419
Cool.

00:10:35.217 --> 00:10:36.594
Oh, shit.

00:10:41.349 --> 00:10:42.683
It's not that big a deal.

00:10:42.767 --> 00:10:44.393
I shouldn't have fuckin' said anything.

00:10:44.477 --> 00:10:46.562
Just shut the fuck up, narc.

00:10:47.063 --> 00:10:50.483
Look, I don't deal deal like that,
you know. Like,

00:10:52.401 --> 00:10:55.655
I distribute, just little bits
here and there,

00:10:55.655 --> 00:10:57.365
when I'm holdin', you know.

00:10:57.365 --> 00:10:58.491
Out of my restaurant.

00:10:58.491 --> 00:11:02.244
Out of the alley behind your
brother's restaurant to help it.

00:11:03.913 --> 00:11:05.581
Wasn't my idea, by the way.

00:11:09.210 --> 00:11:10.252
Whose idea was it?

00:11:10.336 --> 00:11:13.172
Come on, man.
Think you can guess, Cousin.

00:11:13.756 --> 00:11:15.174
Let me ask you somethin'.

00:11:15.549 --> 00:11:19.762
How the fuck do you think we made it
through COVID, huh?

00:11:20.304 --> 00:11:21.430
Side hustle.

00:11:21.806 --> 00:11:23.891
And that's the kind of stick-to-it-ness,

00:11:23.891 --> 00:11:26.352
and ingenuity
and out of the box thinking

00:11:26.352 --> 00:11:27.687
that we look for in employees.

00:11:28.437 --> 00:11:30.231
But that ship has sailed, my friend.

00:11:34.985 --> 00:11:38.239
I should... I should call
the fucking police on you.

00:11:38.239 --> 00:11:40.825
I should call the police on you
for being a naive pussy.

00:11:40.825 --> 00:11:42.535
No, we're done with this bullshit, okay?

00:11:42.535 --> 00:11:44.954
We're done with your stupid friends.
We're done with Nico.

00:11:44.954 --> 00:11:47.790
Nico's got nothing to do with this.
There's something else.

00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:49.875
Richie, I swear to God! I swear to God!

00:11:49.959 --> 00:11:51.877
All right, relax.
Don't blow a fuse, all right?

00:11:58.008 --> 00:11:59.093
Fuckin' A.

00:12:02.388 --> 00:12:03.556
Fuck me.

00:12:05.683 --> 00:12:07.101
- Kitchen?
- Out.

00:12:07.101 --> 00:12:08.227
Up front?

00:12:08.519 --> 00:12:10.229
- Off!
- Walk-in?

00:12:10.438 --> 00:12:12.314
- Kitchen works!
- Walk-in's toast.

00:12:12.398 --> 00:12:13.441
The fuck!

00:12:15.609 --> 00:12:17.611
That's every bag of ice in River North.

00:12:18.487 --> 00:12:19.572
Fak, how we lookin'?

00:12:19.572 --> 00:12:21.282
- Good news and bad news, Carmy.
- Sure.

00:12:21.282 --> 00:12:24.744
Yeah, condenser is fried.
It's gonna cost a couple racks to fix.

00:12:24.744 --> 00:12:27.413
But I got a connect on a condenser guy.

00:12:27.413 --> 00:12:28.539
What's good news?

00:12:28.539 --> 00:12:29.623
The connect.

00:12:29.707 --> 00:12:30.875
Okay.

00:12:32.626 --> 00:12:33.878
Actually, change of plans.

00:12:33.878 --> 00:12:37.089
We're gonna take everything, just take
it outside, all right? Take it outside.

00:12:37.173 --> 00:12:41.802
What do you want with it?
All right, let's go, let's go.

00:12:42.303 --> 00:12:46.182
Yo, my guy. Yeah, can I ask you a favor?

00:12:51.187 --> 00:12:52.938
Glad I was working from home today.

00:12:53.022 --> 00:12:54.356
Dude, you're a lifesaver, Pete.

00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:56.692
- Yeah, you're a real stud, Petey.
- Thanks, Cousin.

00:12:56.776 --> 00:12:58.027
I ain't your cousin.

00:12:58.027 --> 00:13:00.988
- Very well.
- Sorry, he's not my cousin either.

00:13:03.491 --> 00:13:04.950
- Hey, everyone.
- Hey.

00:13:05.034 --> 00:13:06.160
Dum-dum-dum.

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:09.079
- Nice to see you guys. What's going on?
- Nothin'.

00:13:09.163 --> 00:13:12.166
Hey, it's all right. We asked Pete's
permission here. Right, Pete?

00:13:12.166 --> 00:13:14.043
Oh, you asked Pete.

00:13:14.043 --> 00:13:17.379
Yeah, honey, I said it'd be cool
if they were to use the...

00:13:17.463 --> 00:13:19.507
Okay, well, if you said
it would be cool...

00:13:19.507 --> 00:13:21.509
- Nat...
- Gonna let her talk to you like that?

00:13:21.509 --> 00:13:23.886
- Go fuck yourself, Richard!
- Yeah, I will.

00:13:23.886 --> 00:13:25.638
Could we do this later?
I got a lot going on.

00:13:25.638 --> 00:13:27.389
Yeah, I also have a lot going on.

00:13:27.473 --> 00:13:29.850
Did you know I recently had
a brother die too?

00:13:29.934 --> 00:13:31.018
Dark.

00:13:33.938 --> 00:13:35.272
That was dark.

00:13:37.066 --> 00:13:39.985
Yeah, of course you're a Cubs fan.

00:13:40.236 --> 00:13:41.612
Who doesn't love the Cubs?

00:13:42.238 --> 00:13:44.073
I bet you can't name the first baseman.

00:13:44.573 --> 00:13:45.783
Alfonso Rivas.

00:13:49.078 --> 00:13:51.038
Hey, Nat, straight up,
that was fucking gnarly.

00:13:51.038 --> 00:13:53.040
- You're such a soft, shitty bitch.
- What?

00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:56.710
You called Pete 'cause you're too scared
to call me. That's weak, bro.

00:13:56.794 --> 00:13:58.629
No, I called Pete
'cause every time I call you,

00:13:58.629 --> 00:14:00.589
you talk shit and I don't want a fight.

00:14:00.673 --> 00:14:02.758
You only call me when
you're freaking out!

00:14:02.842 --> 00:14:05.386
And since I know you're low on time,
here are the bullet points.

00:14:05.386 --> 00:14:07.179
You only appear when you need something,

00:14:07.263 --> 00:14:09.139
you never got back
to me about the thing,

00:14:09.223 --> 00:14:12.101
you spend every minute since you've
been back in that restaurant,

00:14:12.101 --> 00:14:14.019
and now you're taking advantage of Pete?

00:14:14.103 --> 00:14:16.438
And you know how much I hate
Richie being here.

00:14:16.522 --> 00:14:19.525
I'm fine with all that,
except I do kinda like Pete now and...

00:14:19.525 --> 00:14:22.236
- Man, you have such a fucking attitude!
- I went to the thing.

00:14:25.281 --> 00:14:26.782
You went to a meeting?

00:14:29.785 --> 00:14:31.412
Yeah, I go three times a week.

00:14:33.247 --> 00:14:34.290
Where?

00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:35.499
River North.

00:14:36.667 --> 00:14:37.960
Al Family?

00:14:38.335 --> 00:14:39.420
Al Family, yeah.

00:14:46.635 --> 00:14:48.470
Will you fight with me tomorrow?

00:14:48.971 --> 00:14:49.972
Yeah.

00:14:51.891 --> 00:14:53.809
We have one hour
to service, Chefs.

00:14:53.893 --> 00:14:56.520
- Chef, there's no light out front.
- There's no more space.

00:14:56.604 --> 00:14:59.148
Okay, that's fine. That's okay.

00:14:59.148 --> 00:15:01.692
Angel, I want you to take every single
stock pot that we have

00:15:01.692 --> 00:15:02.985
and put it on the stove.

00:15:02.985 --> 00:15:06.071
Ebra, just get all the beef,
put it in gravy,

00:15:06.196 --> 00:15:07.907
- cover it, warm it up for service.
- Yes, Chef.

00:15:07.907 --> 00:15:09.533
Tina, switch to potato prep.

00:15:09.617 --> 00:15:11.368
Manny, we're gonna take
all the vegetables

00:15:11.452 --> 00:15:12.661
that don't fit in the low boy,

00:15:12.745 --> 00:15:16.457
all the chicken, put 'em in the pots,
cover 'em, stock it all, okay?

00:15:16.832 --> 00:15:19.501
- So, you done this before?
- Some kind.

00:15:23.589 --> 00:15:24.632
<i>Ingles?</i>

00:15:24.632 --> 00:15:26.258
The pilot light is out!

00:15:26.342 --> 00:15:27.635
- Let me check that.
- Okay.

00:15:28.093 --> 00:15:29.345
Try it now.

00:15:30.220 --> 00:15:31.472
Still nothing.

00:15:32.139 --> 00:15:33.307
Neil!

00:15:33.307 --> 00:15:35.059
What now?

00:15:35.059 --> 00:15:36.769
Gas line down.

00:15:38.687 --> 00:15:39.939
Son of a bitch.

00:15:41.398 --> 00:15:43.067
Chef, we can't open.

00:15:44.234 --> 00:15:46.904
Yeah, no gas.
Gary, getting greasy in here.

00:15:46.904 --> 00:15:48.572
Are they still building
across the street?

00:15:48.656 --> 00:15:49.782
Very dangerous.

00:15:49.782 --> 00:15:51.659
<i>Let it crash down low</i>

00:15:52.117 --> 00:15:55.079
<i>See my house down there
But I lost it</i>

00:15:56.288 --> 00:15:57.581
<i>Long ago</i>

00:16:13.931 --> 00:16:17.726
<i>Well, I let the rock roll on down
To the town below</i>

00:16:19.603 --> 00:16:21.772
<i>We had a house down there
But I lost it...</i>

00:16:21.772 --> 00:16:22.982
Okay. I got it.

00:16:26.068 --> 00:16:27.695
- Hey!
- Yo.

00:16:27.695 --> 00:16:29.029
Yo, what's goin' on?

00:16:29.655 --> 00:16:33.826
Gas line is still down.
Power's out, so outdoor lunch service.

00:16:34.576 --> 00:16:37.788
That's good. That's rad, Chef.
I'mma grab some, I'll give you a hand.

00:16:37.788 --> 00:16:38.956
Thanks.

00:16:41.417 --> 00:16:44.837
Yo, let me get 10 cheese for the day,
six hot, four sweet. Thank you.

00:16:44.837 --> 00:16:46.338
Don't have enough pepper, Chef?

00:16:46.422 --> 00:16:49.008 line:20%
Yes, we do.
Yo, Sweeps, let me get

00:16:49.008 --> 00:16:50.843 line:20%
- a full line restock here.
- Got ya.

00:16:50.843 --> 00:16:53.387 line:20%
And also, a towel for Tina.

00:16:53.387 --> 00:16:56.515 line:20%
Yes, 'cause it's flamy.
Yo, Chef, it's a fire.

00:17:10.279 --> 00:17:13.240
Chef, you all right?

00:17:14.533 --> 00:17:15.617
Fucked up.

00:17:16.910 --> 00:17:18.370
I was behind on cakes,

00:17:18.454 --> 00:17:20.789
tried to speed it up,
and I blew the fuse.

00:17:22.041 --> 00:17:23.208
This job's insane.

00:17:25.544 --> 00:17:27.504
It could go from
chill to unchill in a second

00:17:27.588 --> 00:17:30.340
but you gotta stay ahead on your work,
that's just that.

00:17:30.424 --> 00:17:31.467
Heard.

00:17:32.718 --> 00:17:35.721
My first job was McDonald's.
And you don't get to be creative.

00:17:35.721 --> 00:17:39.391
You just work with robots,
and everything's automatic,

00:17:39.475 --> 00:17:40.809
and fast and easy.

00:17:42.895 --> 00:17:44.646
I won't make a mistake again.

00:17:45.230 --> 00:17:48.067
Yeah, you will.
But not 'cause you're you,

00:17:48.067 --> 00:17:49.985
just 'cause shit happens.

00:17:52.905 --> 00:17:54.531
I started a fryer fire,

00:17:54.615 --> 00:17:56.784
night after I won <i>Food and Wine's</i>
Best New Chef.

00:17:56.784 --> 00:17:58.202
Nearly burned the place down.

00:17:58.202 --> 00:17:59.661
- For real?
- For real.

00:18:02.331 --> 00:18:05.167
This weird thing happens too,
you have this minute where

00:18:05.751 --> 00:18:08.587
you're watchin' the fire
and you're thinkin',

00:18:08.587 --> 00:18:12.508
"If I don't do anything,
this place will burn down,

00:18:13.842 --> 00:18:16.011
"and all my anxiety
will go away with it."

00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:19.681
Then you put the fire out.

00:18:21.183 --> 00:18:22.559
Then you put the fire out.

00:18:24.561 --> 00:18:28.065
So, what's up? You wanna be a baby for
another minute or you tryin' to party?

00:18:29.233 --> 00:18:30.734
- Let's party.
- Let's party.

00:18:34.696 --> 00:18:37.157
Chef, get in there, let's go,
suck it up, come on.

00:18:39.952 --> 00:18:41.787
Hey, kudos to the chef!

00:18:48.710 --> 00:18:50.295
Fifty-five hundred dollars?

00:18:50.379 --> 00:18:52.673
Yeah, I'm sorry,
but yes, dude, yeah.

00:18:52.673 --> 00:18:54.258
- Bro.
- Bro.

00:18:55.634 --> 00:18:56.760
You said you had a connect.

00:18:56.844 --> 00:19:00.139
Yeah, I definitely, definitely did not.
Don't have a connect.

00:19:02.182 --> 00:19:04.268
How are we gonna get $5,500 that fast?

00:19:09.398 --> 00:19:10.732
Fuck!

00:19:14.361 --> 00:19:16.905
It's pretty interestin',
you guys comin' to me now.

00:19:18.407 --> 00:19:21.201
I don't know.
Obviously I'mma have to think about it.

00:19:21.910 --> 00:19:24.580
Cousin, it's one more time.
It's never again.

00:19:24.580 --> 00:19:27.291
I want it far away.
I don't wanna know the details.

00:19:27.791 --> 00:19:31.128
We need this.
Fridge won't work without a condenser.

00:19:31.128 --> 00:19:35.716
We? We? Say "Matae."

00:19:36.008 --> 00:19:38.635
- Richie.
- No. Say "Matae," Neil.

00:19:40.637 --> 00:19:41.930
You didn't even win.

00:19:43.765 --> 00:19:44.975
This is me winning.

00:19:48.353 --> 00:19:49.605
Say "Matae."

00:19:50.731 --> 00:19:51.899
Say it, Fak.

00:19:52.232 --> 00:19:53.233
Carm.

00:19:54.484 --> 00:19:55.861
Say "Matae," bro.

00:19:58.363 --> 00:20:01.575
Okay. Matae. Matae. Matae.

00:20:05.454 --> 00:20:07.623
Your wish is my command, Neil.

00:20:09.958 --> 00:20:12.794
- Cousin, this is the last time, right?
- Yeah.

00:20:14.546 --> 00:20:16.423
- Richard.

00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:21.678
Carmen, I understand.

00:20:28.227 --> 00:20:29.311
Fuck!

00:20:31.939 --> 00:20:33.023
All right.

00:20:45.369 --> 00:20:46.370
Chef.

00:20:49.456 --> 00:20:51.041
- Yeah? Yeah.
- Yeah.

00:20:57.422 --> 00:20:59.675
You were great today. Thank you.

00:21:01.426 --> 00:21:05.472
Thanks. That reminded me
of, like, catering,

00:21:05.973 --> 00:21:08.267
just that energy, I don't know.

00:21:09.726 --> 00:21:12.354
What was the deal with that?
Was it just like the world or...

00:21:12.354 --> 00:21:15.357
Jeez, it was a lot of things.

00:21:16.733 --> 00:21:19.653
Got too big, too fast.

00:21:22.155 --> 00:21:27.119
Wasn't exactly liquid enough
for a brick and mortar

00:21:27.119 --> 00:21:31.248
and so running it
out of my garage was stupid.

00:21:32.916 --> 00:21:36.962
My credit got destroyed.
I mean, my whole shit got rocked.

00:21:37.713 --> 00:21:40.340
And there's not a night I don't stay up

00:21:40.424 --> 00:21:43.218
just thinking about
what I could've done different.

00:21:44.803 --> 00:21:47.806
Like, it was a first time
I didn't have a complete

00:21:48.307 --> 00:21:51.143
and utter psychopath
behind me screaming,

00:21:51.143 --> 00:21:53.895
and pushing and yelling,

00:21:55.731 --> 00:21:58.025
and I thought I wanted that, you know?

00:22:00.277 --> 00:22:03.739
But look where that got me. So...

00:22:06.616 --> 00:22:07.743
Heard, Chef.

00:22:11.330 --> 00:22:13.498
Can you help me strain the stock?

00:22:13.582 --> 00:22:15.375
Yeah, of course. Yes, Chef.

00:22:20.464 --> 00:22:21.465
Thanks.

00:22:21.715 --> 00:22:23.633
<i>This is what love is for</i>

00:22:26.094 --> 00:22:27.804
<i>To be out of place</i>

00:22:30.849 --> 00:22:32.434
<i>Gorgeous and alone</i>

00:22:33.268 --> 00:22:35.062
<i>Face to face</i>

00:22:40.025 --> 00:22:41.943
<i>With no larger problems</i>

00:22:44.237 --> 00:22:46.281
<i>That need to be erased</i>

00:22:49.159 --> 00:22:52.871
<i>Nothing more important than to know</i>

00:22:53.914 --> 00:22:56.166
<i>Someone's listening</i>

00:22:56.416 --> 00:23:00.712
<i>Now I know you'll be listening</i>
