WEBVTT

00:00:15.015 --> 00:00:16.975
So, you guys
wanna hear the story?

00:00:16.975 --> 00:00:18.226
Yeah, Mikes, go ahead.

00:00:18.643 --> 00:00:19.644
Let's go.

00:00:19.728 --> 00:00:22.022
MAN 2: It's all right. Here we go.
All right.

00:00:22.022 --> 00:00:23.314
So we're at Ceres, right,

00:00:23.398 --> 00:00:26.609
which was the bar at the bottom of
the Board of Trade Building.

00:00:26.735 --> 00:00:29.154
It was just this little bar
in the lobby, right?

00:00:29.154 --> 00:00:31.531
The place opened at 6:30 in the morning,

00:00:31.656 --> 00:00:34.284
so that when traders lost their ass
when the market opened,

00:00:34.284 --> 00:00:38.163
they could just walk over and just
get hammered in this little fucking bar.

00:00:38.163 --> 00:00:40.165
Anyway, the name "Ceres"...

00:00:40.165 --> 00:00:42.917
It was named after
the Goddess of Agriculture,

00:00:43.001 --> 00:00:45.045
- sorry, and...
- You and your fucking Ceres...

00:00:45.045 --> 00:00:47.964
- Someone's jealous you weren't invited?
- I would not have gone.

00:00:48.048 --> 00:00:50.175
You would've gone.
Carmy, grate some parmesan.

00:00:50.175 --> 00:00:51.384
- You're jealous.
- I got ya.

00:00:51.468 --> 00:00:52.469
- Betcha did.
- Anyway,

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.763
on top of the building,
there was a statue of Ceres,

00:00:54.763 --> 00:00:58.099
and her back, for all of you historians,
was facing towards the east.

00:00:58.183 --> 00:01:01.394
And that's because all the trading
had just moved to the Midwest.

00:01:01.478 --> 00:01:04.064
So, the architect John Storrs,
legend has it,

00:01:04.064 --> 00:01:06.858
he built this statue
as like a big "fuck you."

00:01:06.858 --> 00:01:10.487
Christ. Wake me up when the story starts
and the fucking class is dismissed.

00:01:10.487 --> 00:01:13.073
- Tell the story!
- I'm trying' to tell the fucking story.

00:01:13.073 --> 00:01:14.699
Anyway... Just let me have this.

00:01:14.824 --> 00:01:18.161
Anyway, so, the point is, we're out
all night, we're drunk as shit,

00:01:18.286 --> 00:01:19.537
we're fucking high as shit,

00:01:19.621 --> 00:01:22.540
we figured the only place
that's still open of course... Ceres.

00:01:22.665 --> 00:01:25.376
And being 6:45 in the morning,
we are right to assume that

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:27.504
the place is gonna be
a fuckin' ghost town.

00:01:27.504 --> 00:01:29.881
- Fuck off.
- Get outta here with those raisins.

00:01:29.881 --> 00:01:32.425
- Mum always added raisins.
- We are not doing raisins.

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:35.053
- Anyway, cousin, was it a ghost town?
- It was not a ghost town.

00:01:35.053 --> 00:01:38.515
Not only was it not a ghost town,
it was a fucking rager.

00:01:38.515 --> 00:01:41.810
It was fucking packed.
It was just like...  Right?

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:45.063
All fucking Blackhawk fans,
and, cousin, who's there?

00:01:45.063 --> 00:01:46.147
Savvy.

00:01:46.231 --> 00:01:47.649
- Get outta here.
- Yeah! Savvy!

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:49.400
Denis motherfucking Savard.

00:01:49.526 --> 00:01:50.527
Number 18.

00:01:50.693 --> 00:01:54.531
In the house. But now, he...
It does not stop there.

00:01:54.739 --> 00:01:58.660
Chelios, fuckin' Belfour.
Let's go! Right?

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:01.538
The night before,
Savvy had gotten inducted into

00:02:01.538 --> 00:02:02.914
the Hockey Hall of Fame.

00:02:03.123 --> 00:02:06.960
We walk into this giant fucking party.
It's going off!

00:02:07.085 --> 00:02:08.086
Brouhaha.

00:02:08.086 --> 00:02:10.839
And this motherfucker, he somehow...
This curious fellow,

00:02:10.964 --> 00:02:12.966
he somehow gets his hands on,
what was it?

00:02:12.966 --> 00:02:14.759
It was a Ceres pamphlet?

00:02:14.926 --> 00:02:16.177
Yep. Behind the bar.

00:02:16.302 --> 00:02:17.846
- Right...
- Behind the bar.

00:02:18.012 --> 00:02:21.141
He's reading aloud about the history
of the Goddess of Agriculture.

00:02:21.141 --> 00:02:23.810
Somehow, he decides that he too has

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.229
this deep connection
to, uh, to agriculture, right?

00:02:26.354 --> 00:02:29.232
He takes out his phone,
starts leaving this outgoing message.

00:02:29.232 --> 00:02:30.441
What was the message?

00:02:30.525 --> 00:02:33.736
"Hi. You have reached
the voicemail of Richie Jermovic,

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.865
"the Goddess of Agriculture."

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:38.616
- Fucking stupid!
- So dumb!

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:39.701
Shit is genius!

00:02:39.701 --> 00:02:42.162
Goddess over here,
he is trying to leave this message,

00:02:42.162 --> 00:02:45.999
but he keeps fucking up.
It's just getting louder and louder.

00:02:45.999 --> 00:02:48.168
With all the cacophony
and all the nonsense,

00:02:48.168 --> 00:02:51.880
all the fuckin' hullabaloo,
we hear this fuckin voice ring out.

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:55.175
And the voice says,
"What are you doing?"

00:02:56.509 --> 00:03:00.805
Right? And right in front of us, this
guy, he turns around, who was he?

00:03:01.431 --> 00:03:04.142
- Bill Murray. Bill Murray.
- Of course, it's Bill Murray.

00:03:04.142 --> 00:03:06.936
- What? What?
- Bill fucking Murray!

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:10.523
He's right there. Bill fucking Murray
actually says to Richie,

00:03:10.607 --> 00:03:15.195
he goes, "Why are you doing that?"
And Richie says, "Because it's funny."

00:03:15.653 --> 00:03:18.239
He fucking says that to Bill Murray,
"because it's funny,"

00:03:18.323 --> 00:03:20.200
- and Bill Murray says, "No."
-"It's not."

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.702
"That is not funny."
He goes, "Give me your phone."

00:03:22.911 --> 00:03:24.245
Yeah. Yep.

00:03:24.412 --> 00:03:25.747
<i>And then he goes,</i>

00:03:27.415 --> 00:03:30.293
"What's your name?" Right?

00:03:30.501 --> 00:03:33.004
Bill Murray says this to me.

00:03:33.463 --> 00:03:35.673
The king. Fucking Bill Murray.

00:03:35.757 --> 00:03:37.258
Yeah, I understand who that is.

00:03:37.342 --> 00:03:39.928
If you call me, you can hear it.

00:03:40.803 --> 00:03:42.138
- I get it.
- Call me.

00:03:42.222 --> 00:03:43.473
- I still got it.
- I believe you.

00:03:43.473 --> 00:03:45.350
- It's still on my phone.
- I'm good.

00:03:46.643 --> 00:03:47.977
- Really?
- Thank you.

00:03:48.895 --> 00:03:50.230
You don't wanna hear it?

00:03:52.482 --> 00:03:55.652
You guys were at a bar
at 6:45 in the morning?

00:03:58.613 --> 00:04:02.951
Yeah, but the whole point of it is...

00:04:28.893 --> 00:04:30.770
- Okay, that's a good picture.
- Checks.

00:04:30.895 --> 00:04:32.605
That's better.

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:34.023
She has nice eyes.

00:04:34.107 --> 00:04:36.859
She does have nice eyes.
No sense of humor.

00:04:36.943 --> 00:04:39.612
Even worse, Tina, I'll tell you,
even actually much worse,

00:04:39.696 --> 00:04:42.907
- it's like she got no...
- Behind.

00:04:43.283 --> 00:04:46.411
No sense of Chicago history.
You know what I'm saying?

00:04:46.536 --> 00:04:50.623
Whatever. Other fish in the sea.
See you in another <i>galaxy, puta.</i>

00:04:51.082 --> 00:04:54.335
Yo, listen up!
Okay, I just yell like that?

00:04:55.211 --> 00:04:56.254
Yeah, make it worth it.

00:04:56.754 --> 00:05:01.217
Take this green tape off before
it gets to us. It takes five seconds.

00:05:01.551 --> 00:05:03.386
Once it's soapy
and our fingers are pruned,

00:05:03.386 --> 00:05:05.888
we can't fuck with this shit. Cool?

00:05:05.972 --> 00:05:08.516
- Yes, Chef.
- Thank you for your time.

00:05:09.767 --> 00:05:12.061
Two hours to open, chefs.

00:05:12.437 --> 00:05:14.647
Here, Chef,
I hear this new dish is dialed.

00:05:14.814 --> 00:05:16.983
- Would you remind me later?
- That elevated comfort.

00:05:16.983 --> 00:05:18.067
Later is better.

00:05:18.151 --> 00:05:19.986
Braised ribs.
We do the risotto with stock.

00:05:19.986 --> 00:05:21.070
Watch those peppers.

00:05:21.154 --> 00:05:23.614
It's easily adaptable,
we can make it for a great to-go.

00:05:23.698 --> 00:05:26.284
Risotto-to-go?
We're not ready for go at all.

00:05:26.284 --> 00:05:28.328
I'm just saying
you could use a dine-in, dine-out,

00:05:28.328 --> 00:05:30.621
plus we're using ingredients
that are lying around.

00:05:30.705 --> 00:05:33.499
It's pretty smart, let's just try it.
I don't get it.

00:05:33.583 --> 00:05:36.085
- Have a taste, everything's here.
- Chef, listen to me.

00:05:36.377 --> 00:05:40.131
One, I'm thinking about it,
so, hold on, please. Okay?

00:05:40.256 --> 00:05:44.469
Two, I know everybody you used to work
for, I called them before hiring you.

00:05:44.927 --> 00:05:46.137
Why'd you do that?

00:05:46.137 --> 00:05:48.181
Your resume's excellent
and this place is not.

00:05:48.306 --> 00:05:50.933
Everybody said you are incredibly smart
and talented.

00:05:51.017 --> 00:05:54.896
They also said, you are incredibly
impatient, incredibly green.

00:05:55.063 --> 00:05:57.940
Okay, so,
that's why my business couldn't cut it?

00:05:58.024 --> 00:06:00.777
- Why I'm here, why you don't...
- That's not what I'm saying.

00:06:00.777 --> 00:06:03.154
- What are you saying?
- I'm saying give me a minute.

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:05.114
Yes, Chef.

00:06:05.239 --> 00:06:07.533
Can we make this work
without ruining the flow?

00:06:07.617 --> 00:06:08.618
Yes, Chef.

00:06:08.618 --> 00:06:10.620
Manny and Angel
are gonna have a shit-fit...

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:12.497
- I spoke with them already, Chef.
- Okay.

00:06:12.497 --> 00:06:14.207
Now, so you know where I'm coming from,

00:06:14.207 --> 00:06:17.502
we have finally gotten this to a place
where things are

00:06:17.502 --> 00:06:20.630
sort of kind of a little bit chill,
all right?

00:06:20.755 --> 00:06:23.925
I would like to hold on to that
as long as I possibly can

00:06:24.092 --> 00:06:26.177
- God damn it, Carmy.

00:06:26.719 --> 00:06:30.139
- Hey, did you get it?
- What exactly is it I'm looking for?

00:06:30.765 --> 00:06:31.766
Oh! Wow.

00:06:32.225 --> 00:06:34.018
- You are special.
- Yup.

00:06:34.143 --> 00:06:37.230
There is something called
the Internal Revenue Service, and they

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:39.607
- collect taxes from human beings.
- I know this.

00:06:39.607 --> 00:06:41.150
And the people in this place,

00:06:41.234 --> 00:06:45.279
they haven't given that government
organization anything in five years.

00:06:45.405 --> 00:06:49.283
And somehow,
I'm a co-owner in this nightmare.

00:06:49.367 --> 00:06:52.620
And my home will be seized
if I don't give them some money.

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:57.708
Okay, so I've spent the last few days
on top of my other job and my life,

00:06:57.792 --> 00:07:01.629
getting all of your documents in order,
so, I can reach an agreement with them

00:07:01.629 --> 00:07:03.089
to pay a smaller amount.

00:07:03.089 --> 00:07:07.927
I'm gonna need you to go in there and
to get the payroll records from 2018.

00:07:07.927 --> 00:07:09.011
Can you do that?

00:07:09.095 --> 00:07:10.596
- I can do that.
- Thank you.

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:12.932
Who's this seizing your house, Sug?

00:07:13.349 --> 00:07:15.143
The IRS, Rich.

00:07:17.061 --> 00:07:19.439
Tax shit. Yikes.

00:07:19.564 --> 00:07:20.940
You're yikes.

00:07:21.357 --> 00:07:23.609
- Okay, go, Carmy.
- I know exactly where it is.

00:07:23.693 --> 00:07:24.777
Thank you.

00:07:24.944 --> 00:07:27.613
Fuck you. Fuck you.

00:07:29.657 --> 00:07:32.577
Wait a minute, it's a "fuck you."

00:07:32.702 --> 00:07:34.745
Why would he organize it like this?

00:07:34.829 --> 00:07:38.332
- I'll ask him when he's not dead.
- Just...

00:07:58.144 --> 00:08:00.980
Ass.

00:08:03.941 --> 00:08:06.777
- Should I be wearing a gas mask?
- Nah, man. You good.

00:08:06.944 --> 00:08:08.070
Who's that?

00:08:09.572 --> 00:08:15.036
Oh. That's Richard Hart. Hart Bageri in
Copenhagen. He's a bad motherfucker.

00:08:16.245 --> 00:08:19.916
Cool. You good, man?

00:08:20.041 --> 00:08:21.042
Yep. You?

00:08:21.250 --> 00:08:24.587
Yeah, yeah. You know, if you

00:08:24.712 --> 00:08:28.758
need anything, like,
whatever, you know...

00:08:29.717 --> 00:08:31.260
Like what?

00:08:31.344 --> 00:08:34.764
I don't know, like... Oh, fuck it.

00:08:34.889 --> 00:08:38.768
Look, when I tried out for the Cubs,
I was playing on the farm team,

00:08:38.768 --> 00:08:41.354
and they wouldn't put me up.
And I was broke.

00:08:42.939 --> 00:08:46.526
And I got pretty good
at figuring out places to stay.

00:08:46.526 --> 00:08:48.152
Bro, I'm not homeless.

00:08:49.403 --> 00:08:50.905
Then what's up with the nest?

00:08:50.905 --> 00:08:53.741
I just started sleeping here
so I can save time on my commute.

00:08:54.158 --> 00:08:57.453
I'm just so close to nailing these
donuts and they got be perfect.

00:08:57.537 --> 00:09:01.249
Okay, good.
So, you're a psychopath? Cool.

00:09:01.499 --> 00:09:03.376
I just want them to be perfect.

00:09:03.376 --> 00:09:05.920
You want perfection, bro?
Start with a shower.

00:09:07.964 --> 00:09:12.468
It's not that bad.
You used to play for the fucking Cubs?

00:09:18.182 --> 00:09:19.267
You good?

00:09:21.227 --> 00:09:22.353
Yo.

00:09:23.396 --> 00:09:24.438
You okay?

00:09:25.648 --> 00:09:26.649
Yeah.

00:09:29.777 --> 00:09:31.153
Feels weird out there.

00:09:33.864 --> 00:09:35.116
Bar closed.

00:09:35.866 --> 00:09:37.451
You go there a lot?

00:09:37.577 --> 00:09:41.706
Nah. Owner and I don't really
see eye-to-eye.

00:09:42.707 --> 00:09:44.959
But nice to know it was there, you know?

00:09:45.918 --> 00:09:47.753
It was like a fixture.

00:09:47.837 --> 00:09:49.672
Yeah, like Logan.

00:09:50.715 --> 00:09:54.093
Wicker. Pilsen.

00:09:54.218 --> 00:09:55.261
Yeah.

00:09:56.596 --> 00:09:58.472
They all suck now.

00:09:58.598 --> 00:10:00.057
They're different.

00:10:00.725 --> 00:10:02.977
Yeah, they are different.

00:10:02.977 --> 00:10:05.730
That's why I keep telling you
to stop fucking with this place.

00:10:05.855 --> 00:10:10.568
You know, you let up a little bit,
everything changes.

00:10:10.693 --> 00:10:14.697
You know, you don't realize,
this is a delicate ecosystem,

00:10:16.157 --> 00:10:18.993
and it's held together
by a shared history,

00:10:18.993 --> 00:10:21.912
and love, and respect.

00:10:26.751 --> 00:10:30.880
There's this statue on top of
the Board of Trade.

00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:35.885
Goddess, right? She has no face.
People are like, "Where is her face?"

00:10:36.135 --> 00:10:39.930
And architect John Storrs, right,
John Storrs goes,

00:10:40.014 --> 00:10:42.892
"When we put it up there,
it was the tallest building in the city

00:10:42.892 --> 00:10:46.937
"and no one was really gonna see her
face, so we didn't bother to put one."

00:10:48.022 --> 00:10:51.317
But now, every goddamn building
is taller than the next one,

00:10:51.442 --> 00:10:54.236
and they all look out at this chick
with no face, and it's just...

00:10:55.613 --> 00:10:58.741
- Yo, what the fuck? Who's shooting man?
- Keep it down. What the fuck.

00:10:59.075 --> 00:11:00.826
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- Everybody okay?

00:11:00.910 --> 00:11:01.911
- You good?
- Yeah.

00:11:02.119 --> 00:11:03.371
- Sweeps.
- Motherfuck!

00:11:03.371 --> 00:11:04.455
Everybody okay, yeah?

00:11:04.455 --> 00:11:06.582
- Small arms. A pistol.
- Everybody straight?

00:11:06.666 --> 00:11:08.668
The fuck is
going on around here?

00:11:08.668 --> 00:11:11.462
Yo, Richie. Don't go out there.
What you doing, bro?

00:11:23.683 --> 00:11:26.936
- Hey, yo. Crooked John.
- Hey, man.

00:11:27.436 --> 00:11:28.521
What's up?

00:11:28.646 --> 00:11:30.147
You guys see who shot up my window?

00:11:30.231 --> 00:11:33.234
I didn't see it, man.
Scared the shit outta me, though.

00:11:33.359 --> 00:11:34.777
Sounded like a little marble.

00:11:34.777 --> 00:11:36.112
Yeah, right?

00:11:36.278 --> 00:11:39.156
Probably some dumb ass kid
fucking with his mom's .22.

00:11:40.241 --> 00:11:44.537
Listen, man, you know you guys aren't
supposed to be hanging out here.

00:11:44.704 --> 00:11:46.372
I asked you to hang out down there.

00:11:46.372 --> 00:11:47.790
Man, don't call the cops.

00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:50.793
John. Don't hurt my feelings.
How long have you known me?

00:11:51.377 --> 00:11:54.380
I do not give a fuck what you do,
or who you do it with.

00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:58.926
All I ask is you do it over there,
and keep it at a reasonable volume.

00:11:58.926 --> 00:12:01.637
- But we can't chill over there, man.
- Why?

00:12:01.762 --> 00:12:02.763
It's dangerous.

00:12:02.847 --> 00:12:05.516
Dangerous? All you motherfuckers
have weapons on you.

00:12:05.516 --> 00:12:08.728
It's a different dangerous.
Construction dangerous.

00:12:08.978 --> 00:12:12.189
The vent went cold. The whole shit's
gutted. Building a Sweetgreen.

00:12:12.356 --> 00:12:15.860
Are you fucking kidding me right now?
You know the bar's closed, too.

00:12:16.026 --> 00:12:17.528
It's getting ugly.

00:12:17.653 --> 00:12:20.573
All right, I'll tell you what.
Do me a favor, okay?

00:12:20.573 --> 00:12:25.244
Ask around, see if you can sniff out
who shot up my shit. Check Al's.

00:12:25.369 --> 00:12:26.370
All right.

00:12:26.454 --> 00:12:28.414
In exchange, you guys can hang out here.

00:12:28.414 --> 00:12:30.624
But low pro, all right?

00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:34.295
I don't want any noise,
any fucking gangster shit popping off,

00:12:34.295 --> 00:12:36.881
anything that's gonna freak out
my customers, okay?

00:12:36.881 --> 00:12:37.965
- All right.
- You dig?

00:12:38.132 --> 00:12:41.761
- Dug. Respect. Okay?
- All right. All right. Thanks, bro.

00:12:41.969 --> 00:12:43.512
You heard him, okay?

00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:48.934
- I love coming here.
- Sugar.

00:12:52.646 --> 00:12:54.398
- You okay?
- Yeah, you?

00:12:54.732 --> 00:12:57.109
Yeah, fuck. I don't even know anymore.

00:12:58.694 --> 00:13:00.821
Should we call the cops?

00:13:00.905 --> 00:13:02.072
- No.
- No.

00:13:02.156 --> 00:13:04.450
- They're sweeping glass up.
- I know.

00:13:04.575 --> 00:13:05.993
- Tuesday afternoon.
- Sugar...

00:13:05.993 --> 00:13:07.203
I'm gonna lose my house.

00:13:07.203 --> 00:13:10.915
Don't co-sign for a drug addict.
45 minutes to open, chefs!

00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:12.208
- Yes, Chef.
- Yes, Chef.

00:13:12.208 --> 00:13:15.377
- Keep not processing trauma, Carm.
- Dude, what? I can't close.

00:13:15.461 --> 00:13:17.463
Keep working.
It's like nothing ever happened.

00:13:17.463 --> 00:13:19.965
A window got shot out,
everybody is fine. The end.

00:13:20.090 --> 00:13:21.634
- That's what I'm saying.
- Natalie.

00:13:21.634 --> 00:13:22.760
Carmy.

00:13:24.011 --> 00:13:26.472
- You're pissing me off.
- You're pissing me off!

00:13:27.765 --> 00:13:28.766
Carm.

00:13:29.308 --> 00:13:30.476
Fucking go.

00:13:35.231 --> 00:13:36.232
What?

00:13:38.651 --> 00:13:39.985
I didn't say anything.

00:13:45.282 --> 00:13:48.911
Did you find Sugar's... I don't know...

00:13:51.705 --> 00:13:53.666
- garbage?
- No, no. I didn't find it.

00:13:56.210 --> 00:13:59.880
Yeah. Paperwork's not really my jam.

00:14:00.631 --> 00:14:01.882
Me, neither.

00:14:04.844 --> 00:14:08.514
They didn't teach you
accounting at Noma?

00:14:11.642 --> 00:14:13.769
- They teach you at DeVry?
- Yeah.

00:14:17.606 --> 00:14:18.983
What is that? Oven?

00:14:21.277 --> 00:14:22.319
No.

00:14:24.572 --> 00:14:29.493
No, it was
Michael's 15th birthday party.

00:14:31.495 --> 00:14:33.622
Jan-Carlo and Fak got into a fight,

00:14:33.706 --> 00:14:36.292
I tried to break it up
and fell into the barbeque.

00:14:36.417 --> 00:14:39.753
God. Feck.

00:14:47.428 --> 00:14:49.346
Is there a name for that thing where,

00:14:51.307 --> 00:14:53.058
you're afraid of
something good happening

00:14:53.142 --> 00:14:55.936
'cause you think something
bad's gonna happen?

00:14:57.813 --> 00:15:00.524
I don't know. Life?

00:15:08.407 --> 00:15:12.703
The other day, my kid asked me if
my real last name was "Bad News."

00:15:13.329 --> 00:15:15.497
Like <i>Bad News Bears?</i>

00:15:16.832 --> 00:15:20.044
I guess, I'm in her mom's phone as
"Richie Bad News."

00:15:24.423 --> 00:15:29.136
And I go, "Tiff, what the fuck?"

00:15:31.472 --> 00:15:35.434
She says I'm contagious,
I only call with bad news.

00:15:41.732 --> 00:15:44.026
Maybe that's not what
you're talking about.

00:15:47.696 --> 00:15:51.283
Fuck. I don't know. Fuck it all.

00:16:21.689 --> 00:16:25.442
All right, put me out of my misery.
Flip it, T.

00:16:25.526 --> 00:16:27.820
Hey, look alive, chefs. We open.

00:16:27.820 --> 00:16:29.405
Rock out, let's go.

00:16:29.405 --> 00:16:31.740
All right. Step lively. Let's go.
Single file.

00:16:31.824 --> 00:16:34.326
Oh, shit!
It's the man with the golden dick.

00:16:34.410 --> 00:16:37.037
How are you, Tom? Good to see you, bro.

00:16:38.414 --> 00:16:40.791
Let me get one beef,
little hot, little sweet, dip it.

00:16:41.125 --> 00:16:42.209
Thanks, pal.

00:16:42.209 --> 00:16:45.754
Nick, how's that dog of yours,
by the way? Getting better?

00:16:45.921 --> 00:16:49.425
Got the cone and everything off?
How are you?

00:17:04.898 --> 00:17:06.066
Damn, Chef.

00:17:12.614 --> 00:17:13.615
Mmm.

00:17:14.408 --> 00:17:15.659
Brava.

00:17:16.952 --> 00:17:17.995
Thanks, Chef.

00:17:17.995 --> 00:17:19.663
Ebra and Richie are out front.

00:17:19.747 --> 00:17:21.707
Tina, you're floating.
We good back here?

00:17:21.707 --> 00:17:22.791
Yes, Chef.

00:17:22.875 --> 00:17:24.835
We gotta watch the heat
on the stove, guys.

00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:26.462
These chickens are comin' out dark.

00:17:27.087 --> 00:17:29.256
When's the last time
you cleaned out the grease trap?

00:17:29.256 --> 00:17:31.008
- It's getting backed up.
- I'll get to it.

00:17:31.008 --> 00:17:33.218
- Still dealing with the circuit breaker.
- Thank you.

00:17:33.302 --> 00:17:35.971
Chef, you think now might be
a good time for you to try this?

00:17:36.055 --> 00:17:38.223
- Yes. Thank you for asking.
- Yes.

00:17:38.515 --> 00:17:40.017
- This one?
- Yes.

00:17:50.652 --> 00:17:51.653
It's tremendous, Chef.

00:17:51.737 --> 00:17:52.905
Thank you, Chef.

00:17:54.156 --> 00:17:55.407
Sauce is a little bit tight.

00:17:55.657 --> 00:17:57.117
Yeah, heard. Thank you.

00:17:57.201 --> 00:17:58.202
Mmm. Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm.

00:17:58.494 --> 00:18:02.081
- Do you think maybe soon... Thank you.
- This is fire!

00:18:03.499 --> 00:18:07.628
Maybe we could start rolling it out
as a special soon? Is there a place?

00:18:07.628 --> 00:18:12.007
- It's getting closer. Yeah.
- How close?

00:18:12.508 --> 00:18:15.969
- I told you it was great.
- You said "tremendous," remember?

00:18:16.136 --> 00:18:18.180
I didn't tell you it was perfect.

00:18:18.305 --> 00:18:21.433
Well, yeah, I mean, I like it.

00:18:21.517 --> 00:18:24.520
I think it's great and I'll
definitely loosen up the sauce...

00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:27.689
- Sydney. Sydney.
- You know, I don't understand...

00:18:28.273 --> 00:18:31.276
Chef, it's not ready yet.
You understand?

00:18:33.695 --> 00:18:35.072
Yes, Chef. I understand.

00:18:35.072 --> 00:18:37.032
- Thank you, Chef.
- Thank you, Chef.

00:18:43.831 --> 00:18:48.418
Hi, these are Cola-braised short ribs
with risotto. And they're yours.

00:18:49.211 --> 00:18:50.212
- Really?
- Yup.

00:18:50.212 --> 00:18:53.132
I had an extra and I'm Sydney,
if you need anything else.

00:18:53.465 --> 00:18:56.009
- Well, thank you, Sydney.
- Have a good day.

00:19:01.682 --> 00:19:03.559
- Hey, maybe it's not here.
- No, it's here.

00:19:03.559 --> 00:19:04.643
All right.

00:19:22.202 --> 00:19:25.455
I knew it was dumb to co-sign. FYI.

00:19:25.539 --> 00:19:27.374
I'd have done the same thing.

00:19:30.169 --> 00:19:32.254
- You wanna fight?
- Please.

00:19:33.005 --> 00:19:35.174
- I know you're mad at me.
- This is irresponsible.

00:19:35.174 --> 00:19:37.342
I mean, at your house.
All the stuff you said.

00:19:37.843 --> 00:19:39.011
I was annoyed.

00:19:39.136 --> 00:19:41.180
Yeah. Clearly.

00:19:41.305 --> 00:19:44.892
Look, I think the thing that
just pisses me off,

00:19:45.392 --> 00:19:48.687
is the thing that I'm probably
too embarrassed to admit,

00:19:50.022 --> 00:19:54.735
is that you never ask me how I'm doing.
Like, ever.

00:19:56.069 --> 00:20:00.115
I know it's childish,
but that's why I'm mad at you.

00:20:01.158 --> 00:20:02.159
I think.

00:20:03.243 --> 00:20:06.246
Plus, we never spend
any real time together.

00:20:06.330 --> 00:20:08.707
This place is eating you alive.

00:20:08.832 --> 00:20:10.292
You always blame this place.

00:20:10.542 --> 00:20:12.920
- What do you mean?
- I mean, you blame the restaurant.

00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:16.256
All right, you don't blame Mom.
You don't blame Mikey.

00:20:16.506 --> 00:20:18.217
How can I not blame this place?

00:20:18.383 --> 00:20:22.638
I just cleaned up shot-out glass,
and now, I'm covered in carbon.

00:20:24.264 --> 00:20:29.102
All of our time, money, work,
gets sucked up into this place.

00:20:30.354 --> 00:20:34.816
The only thing we get back is,
chaos, resentment.

00:20:38.779 --> 00:20:39.863
It's bullshit.

00:20:42.074 --> 00:20:43.116
Sounds like Mom.

00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:44.826
- I'm serious.
- I'm serious.

00:20:46.036 --> 00:20:47.829
I just want things to be calm.

00:20:48.705 --> 00:20:52.251
I just want things to be on
solid ground. I want things to feel...

00:20:52.251 --> 00:20:55.337
- Consistent.
- Yeah. Consistent.

00:20:55.504 --> 00:20:59.132
Yeah. That's totally reasonable.

00:21:00.509 --> 00:21:04.596
Well... I appreciate you saying that.

00:21:05.931 --> 00:21:07.266
Um...

00:21:09.601 --> 00:21:12.938
I guess, all the time,
I feel like I'm kind of trapped,

00:21:14.273 --> 00:21:15.857
because I can't describe

00:21:17.150 --> 00:21:18.151
how I'm feeling.

00:21:19.528 --> 00:21:24.491
So, to ask somebody else
how they're feeling, that just seems,

00:21:28.245 --> 00:21:29.830
I don't know, insane?

00:21:34.084 --> 00:21:35.252
Okay.

00:21:35.669 --> 00:21:37.921
I'm sorry. You know,

00:21:38.922 --> 00:21:41.174
you're right.
I wanna know how you're feeling.

00:21:45.470 --> 00:21:46.763
How're you feeling?

00:21:47.389 --> 00:21:51.184
Really good. Just great.

00:21:53.645 --> 00:21:54.771
Right.

00:22:08.577 --> 00:22:10.829
Yo. Yo, is this it?

00:22:15.083 --> 00:22:18.170
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, right?

00:22:18.754 --> 00:22:22.466
Just sittin' in this file labeled...

00:22:23.133 --> 00:22:24.134
-"Shit."
-"Shit."

00:22:37.147 --> 00:22:41.151
Okay, checks.
Little boys look great, guys.

00:22:42.235 --> 00:22:44.154
Holy shit! What's he doing?

00:22:45.864 --> 00:22:49.201
Yo, what's going on with these edges,
Chef? Gotta be cleaner than that.

00:22:49.201 --> 00:22:50.619
This knife is shit.

00:22:50.619 --> 00:22:52.579
When was the last time you sharpened it?

00:22:54.331 --> 00:22:58.210
Fuck! Where's my gun?
Any of you motherfuckers take my gun?

00:23:00.921 --> 00:23:02.172
Carmy!

00:23:04.341 --> 00:23:07.552
What? You know I stay here.
Fuck me? Fuck you.

00:23:07.636 --> 00:23:08.929
Sydney, get 'em.

00:23:10.138 --> 00:23:12.349
Hello, everyone.
Thank you for your patronage.

00:23:12.349 --> 00:23:15.352
Everything's under control.
Please enjoy your beefs.

00:23:15.352 --> 00:23:18.188
Focus on that. Chicago. Am I right?

00:23:19.898 --> 00:23:23.110
Hey, guys! Hey! Guys!

00:23:23.902 --> 00:23:26.321
Guys, shut up! Please.

00:23:27.823 --> 00:23:30.826
Thank you. What's going on here?

00:23:32.285 --> 00:23:33.286
This isn't his space.

00:23:34.621 --> 00:23:36.039
You're the one getting nasty!

00:23:36.123 --> 00:23:38.166
'Cause you're crew's blowing
cigarette smoke!

00:23:38.291 --> 00:23:42.462
Hey! Hey!
Can we lower our voices, please?

00:23:42.754 --> 00:23:46.550
Thank you. I'm Sydney.
Let's start there. I'm Sydney.

00:23:47.467 --> 00:23:48.468
John.

00:23:48.552 --> 00:23:49.719
Mr. Carl.

00:23:50.971 --> 00:23:54.349
Okay. Mr. Carl and John. Hello,

00:23:54.975 --> 00:23:57.936
associates. Good afternoon. Uh...

00:24:01.314 --> 00:24:04.401
- Fuck! Fuck!
- We didn't take your gun, bro.

00:24:05.527 --> 00:24:06.570
Shit!

00:24:07.404 --> 00:24:12.117
You apparently know Tina,
and Gary as well. Great.

00:24:12.117 --> 00:24:15.203
So, now we all are in various states
of knowing each other.

00:24:15.537 --> 00:24:18.874
Cool. Okay, so, so how do we fix this?

00:24:18.874 --> 00:24:21.209
It can't be fixed because
this guy is a bitch.

00:24:21.293 --> 00:24:23.211
You fucking said that for the last time!

00:24:23.295 --> 00:24:25.589
- Come on!
- Yeah you better fuckin' hold me back.

00:24:43.732 --> 00:24:46.318
All right, so,
we can do this every week, yeah?

00:24:46.318 --> 00:24:50.614
Sandwiches, simple conversation,
no yelling,

00:24:50.614 --> 00:24:54.493
no smoking where all the food is,
you know what I mean? All right?

00:24:54.493 --> 00:24:55.702
- Okay.
- Okay.

00:24:55.702 --> 00:24:58.413
We're gonna need pop, too.
To wash down the sandwiches.

00:24:58.497 --> 00:25:00.790
RC, Green River,
whatever we're working with.

00:25:01.208 --> 00:25:02.876
Sure. Great.

00:25:03.043 --> 00:25:05.712
Deal only applies to the guys
who's out here right now.

00:25:05.712 --> 00:25:08.131
So, don't go telling your auntie,
brother, cousin and friends,

00:25:08.215 --> 00:25:10.383
- to come down here every Tuesday, okay?
- Cool.

00:25:10.467 --> 00:25:11.801
- All right.
- Cool.

00:25:11.968 --> 00:25:14.429
Okay, so, we good? Great.

00:25:14.513 --> 00:25:16.515
You guys, take these,
I'll get more of these.

00:25:16.515 --> 00:25:18.266
Wild, man. Stay safe out here, G.

00:25:18.350 --> 00:25:19.851
Hey, fancy now, my guy?

00:25:19.935 --> 00:25:21.728
Yeah, man. Real fancy.

00:25:21.728 --> 00:25:24.314
This is exactly what happens
when you sweep the Padres,

00:25:24.314 --> 00:25:26.441
- but fail the drug test.
- Ah!

00:25:27.901 --> 00:25:28.985
It's handled.

00:25:40.914 --> 00:25:43.750
So, this fucking goon,
he pulls up again.

00:25:43.750 --> 00:25:45.544
And now, this is the third stoplight.

00:25:45.544 --> 00:25:49.047
Let me get two dogs, two chickens,
four all day, please.

00:25:49.047 --> 00:25:51.341
He's fucking with me.
He's revving me.

00:25:51.341 --> 00:25:53.969
Finally, I roll down the window,
and I'm like,

00:25:53.969 --> 00:25:58.682
"Guy, take a breath. It's a fucking
Honda. Let's just chill for a second."

00:25:58.682 --> 00:26:01.226
Sorry. You're gonna love
this next shit. Listen.

00:26:01.226 --> 00:26:03.937
Yeah, I'm rocking. I'm rocking. Okay?

00:26:04.187 --> 00:26:06.481
- I need you on the register.
- One second.

00:26:06.606 --> 00:26:09.734
- Richie! Richie, now! Yo!
- Let me just fucking tell the story.

00:26:09.818 --> 00:26:12.737
Look, will you shut the fuck up
for one second?

00:26:12.821 --> 00:26:17.075
Richard! Outside! Outside now! God.

00:26:17.075 --> 00:26:18.201
Okay, yeah.

00:26:18.285 --> 00:26:20.704
Damn it! Look, I'm gonna throw
some shit at you.

00:26:22.664 --> 00:26:25.208
You remember, Tin,
this place used to be cool, man.

00:26:25.292 --> 00:26:28.169
- Okay, you need to go home and cool off.
- What?

00:26:28.253 --> 00:26:31.298
You need to get outta here.
You are fucking my shit up.

00:26:31.423 --> 00:26:32.674
Are you fucking kidding me?

00:26:33.341 --> 00:26:35.302
I feel like
I'm on a different fucking planet.

00:26:35.302 --> 00:26:38.680
My game has improved 300%
in two months.

00:26:38.805 --> 00:26:41.474
This place is organized.

00:26:41.558 --> 00:26:45.312
And clean. And smooth and...

00:26:46.563 --> 00:26:47.981
Yo, I loved Mikey.

00:26:49.274 --> 00:26:51.610
You know how much I loved that kid.

00:26:51.776 --> 00:26:54.112
But, this...

00:26:56.114 --> 00:26:59.618
This is real and alive and...

00:27:00.619 --> 00:27:01.828
And what?

00:27:02.912 --> 00:27:06.458
And good. It's good.

00:27:07.500 --> 00:27:12.505
Tin, they're kids.
She doesn't understand.

00:27:12.964 --> 00:27:16.593
She's a baby, you know? Walking around
thinking that she can handle shit.

00:27:16.593 --> 00:27:19.220
This is a delicate fucking ecosystem.

00:27:22.223 --> 00:27:23.808
I really don't need this right now.

00:27:23.892 --> 00:27:25.769
I cannot fucking emphasize enough
how much

00:27:25.769 --> 00:27:28.521
I don't fucking need
this shit right now.

00:27:32.859 --> 00:27:34.944
- I'mma quit.
- Quit?

00:27:40.950 --> 00:27:43.119
And where you gonna go, Richie?

00:27:45.080 --> 00:27:46.373
Where you gonna go?

00:28:03.890 --> 00:28:06.476
All right,

00:28:06.476 --> 00:28:08.603

Fire! One rib sauce with pepper.
One mortadelle.

00:28:16.361 --> 00:28:17.612

00:28:17.779 --> 00:28:20.865

Thank you, chefs.

00:28:45.432 --> 00:28:47.058
Do I wanna know
what happened out there?

00:28:47.142 --> 00:28:49.936
No. You do not. But I just
gave some people some leftovers.

00:28:50.061 --> 00:28:52.439
Listen, I'm sorry if I was
shitty earlier today.

00:28:53.648 --> 00:28:56.067
- It's all good.
- Yeah?

00:28:56.776 --> 00:29:00.447
Can I get two more chicken peppers,

00:29:00.447 --> 00:29:02.323
Four all day. Can I hear four all day?

00:29:02.407 --> 00:29:05.118
Four all day, Chef.
Thank you, chefs.

00:29:05.243 --> 00:29:08.288
Yo there's a VIP on 21.

We got four beefs here.
We need them out front, please.

00:29:19.966 --> 00:29:22.218
I love this tempo, though.
Let's keep it up.

00:29:22.302 --> 00:29:25.013
Let's take it up another level.
More urgency, please.

00:29:25.013 --> 00:29:26.973
