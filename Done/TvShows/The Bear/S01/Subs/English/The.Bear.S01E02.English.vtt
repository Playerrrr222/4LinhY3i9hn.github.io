00:00:26.651 --> 00:00:29.696
- Chefs, table 38, two people.
<i>- Oui!</i>

00:00:29.696 --> 00:00:32.490
<i>- Table 23, four people.</i>
- Oui!

00:00:33.658 --> 00:00:35.660
- Broken sauce, chef, need a new one.
- Yes, chef.

00:00:40.623 --> 00:00:43.334
Fire 31, 25,
two out on 31, chefs.

00:00:43.418 --> 00:00:44.461
<i>Oui!</i>

00:00:46.838 --> 00:00:48.590
- Still not there. Again, chef.
- Yes, chef.

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:49.674
Thank you, chef.

00:00:50.508 --> 00:00:52.969
- Late on 31, chefs.
<i>- Oui!</i>

00:00:56.139 --> 00:00:58.391
- Why?
- Chef, I'm sorry. It got too hot.

00:00:58.475 --> 00:01:00.101
- Why?
- It didn't cool down.

00:01:00.185 --> 00:01:01.352
Why?

00:01:01.436 --> 00:01:02.896
- It was my fault.
- Go.

00:01:02.896 --> 00:01:03.980
Fine.

00:01:04.064 --> 00:01:06.232
- Fire 19, chefs.
<i>- Oui!</i>

00:01:06.316 --> 00:01:08.651
- Hold on 17, chefs.
<i>- Oui!</i>

00:01:09.152 --> 00:01:12.238
Why do you hire fucking idiots?
Do you like working with them?

00:01:12.322 --> 00:01:13.573
- I'll do better.
- Say, "Yes."

00:01:13.573 --> 00:01:16.034
- Yes, chef.
- Can you handle this? Is it too much?

00:01:16.034 --> 00:01:17.285
- Answer me.
- I can handle it.

00:01:17.285 --> 00:01:19.370
-"I can handle it, chef."
- I can handle it, chef.

00:01:19.454 --> 00:01:20.914
- Twelve, ten, 36.
- Fire eight,

00:01:20.914 --> 00:01:22.499
- 18, 36.
- Don't fuck with my count!

00:01:22.499 --> 00:01:24.793
- Sorry, chef. Eight, 13, 29...
- Three, 52...

00:01:24.793 --> 00:01:26.503
Why are you serving broken sauces?

00:01:26.503 --> 00:01:28.630
Why? I get it.
You've a short man's complex.

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:30.590
You can barely reach over this table.

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:33.259
Is this why you have the tattoos
and your cool little scars

00:01:33.343 --> 00:01:34.552
and go out for smoke breaks?

00:01:34.636 --> 00:01:36.429
It's fun, isn't it?
But here's the thing.

00:01:36.513 --> 00:01:38.848
You're terrible at this.
You're no good at it.

00:01:38.932 --> 00:01:42.519
Go faster, motherfucker.
Keep going faster. Why are you so slow?

00:01:42.519 --> 00:01:45.438
Why are you so slow? Why?
You think you're so tough?

00:01:45.522 --> 00:01:48.441
Yeah. Why don't you say this?
Say, "Yes, chef. I'm so tough."

00:01:48.525 --> 00:01:51.152
- Yes, chef. I'm so tough.
- Say, "Yes, chef. I'm so tough!"

00:01:51.236 --> 00:01:52.237
Yes, chef. I'm so tough.

00:01:52.362 --> 00:01:55.156
You are not tough. You are bullshit.
You are talentless.

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:56.866
- Say, "Fucking hands."
- Hands!

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:00.370
You should be dead.

00:02:06.417 --> 00:02:08.336
Hands.
<i>Oui.</i>

00:02:15.301 --> 00:02:17.178
Hands!

00:02:17.262 --> 00:02:19.347
Got that change for the $5...

00:02:19.347 --> 00:02:20.598
Hands!

00:02:20.682 --> 00:02:22.725
Fucking Christ! Hands, please!

00:02:23.351 --> 00:02:24.352
Please!

00:02:24.352 --> 00:02:27.522
What are you yelling for?
Oh, God. Why don't you relax?

00:02:27.522 --> 00:02:28.731
Yeah. Thank you, chef.

00:02:28.815 --> 00:02:30.859
Now, what?
I put this in the trash?

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:41.911
Chef, want me to
strain that oil for you?

00:02:41.995 --> 00:02:43.079
No, I got it. Thank you.

00:02:43.163 --> 00:02:44.455
Why am I using a toothbrush?

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:47.000
It's about consistency
and being consistent.

00:02:47.167 --> 00:02:49.752
Can't operate at a higher level
without consistency.

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:52.297
- I like this level. I like this level.
- Me, too.

00:02:52.297 --> 00:02:55.008
At The French Laundry,
you know how much time we'd spend?

00:02:55.008 --> 00:02:56.676
Go fuck your French Laundry.

00:02:56.676 --> 00:02:58.052
Stupid fucking name.

00:02:58.136 --> 00:02:59.762
- All right, then at Noma.
- Right?

00:02:59.846 --> 00:03:00.847
Fuck your Noma too.

00:03:00.972 --> 00:03:02.807
- System, baby.
- Noma's the shit, huh?

00:03:02.932 --> 00:03:03.933
- The best.
- The best.

00:03:04.017 --> 00:03:06.895
Teach you to operate at a level
you didn't know you could, Marcus.

00:03:06.895 --> 00:03:09.355
And I wanted to work here.
Mike wouldn't let me.

00:03:09.439 --> 00:03:13.276
No, no. You went halfway around
the world to learn all this fancy,

00:03:13.276 --> 00:03:14.903
useless fucking bullshit.

00:03:14.903 --> 00:03:18.239
I went to West Lawrence Avenue
and learned every level.

00:03:18.323 --> 00:03:20.491
- You're talking about DeVry?
- Yeah, exactly.

00:03:20.575 --> 00:03:22.660
Oh, DeVry.
"We're serious about success."

00:03:22.744 --> 00:03:24.871
Is that supposed to be fucking funny, fucko?

00:03:25.163 --> 00:03:27.916
Yeah! Let me tell you something.
No, for real.

00:03:27.916 --> 00:03:29.500
Where else are you gonna learn

00:03:29.584 --> 00:03:32.086
crucial database management
specialization skills

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:35.006
while troubleshooting
a vented OptiSpark distributor

00:03:35.006 --> 00:03:37.008
- in a Trans Am.
- Don't need to learn that.

00:03:37.008 --> 00:03:38.092
Definitely not Noma.

00:03:38.176 --> 00:03:39.928
I would legit do anything to go to Noma.

00:03:39.928 --> 00:03:41.012
And eat bugs?

00:03:41.012 --> 00:03:43.473
- And be inspired, stupid.
- God, and be lame.

00:03:43.598 --> 00:03:45.308
Guys, the cream machine is broken.

00:03:46.017 --> 00:03:47.018
Shit.

00:03:47.143 --> 00:03:48.770
DeVry teach you to fix that?

00:03:49.938 --> 00:03:50.939
You know what?

00:03:51.314 --> 00:03:52.982
Actually, yes.

00:03:53.816 --> 00:03:54.943
Fuck yourself.

00:03:54.943 --> 00:03:56.361
- You graduated?
- Fuck no.

00:03:58.947 --> 00:04:00.949
Does anyone ever order the ice cream?

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:03.201
- I forgot we had ice cream.
- Hmm.

00:05:40.214 --> 00:05:44.302
<i>Maria folds the dough, picking up
all the flour so her board is clean.</i>

00:05:45.636 --> 00:05:47.555
<i>She then kneads it until it is smooth.</i>

00:05:48.556 --> 00:05:51.142
<i>The dough should rest
for at least 30 minutes.</i>

00:05:52.101 --> 00:05:54.687
<i>Maria roughly chops
two cloves of garlic...</i>

00:06:01.361 --> 00:06:03.529
- Fire, table 16!
- <i>Oui!</i>

00:06:03.613 --> 00:06:05.907
- 17! Table 23!
<i>- Oui!</i>

00:06:09.577 --> 00:06:11.162 line:20%
<i>Go faster, motherfucker.</i>

00:06:11.162 --> 00:06:14.332 line:20%
Let's go! Let's fucking go!

00:06:15.249 --> 00:06:16.459 line:20%
<i>Take a break, sweetheart.</i>

00:06:24.967 --> 00:06:25.968
Fuck!

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:05.258
Hey, you got time?

00:07:05.466 --> 00:07:06.759
Always. What's up?

00:07:07.009 --> 00:07:10.012
I... I just wanted to say thanks
for this past week.

00:07:10.096 --> 00:07:14.559
It's been a really great opportunity,
but I want to do more.

00:07:14.559 --> 00:07:16.269
- I know you want more.
- I want more...

00:07:16.269 --> 00:07:18.062
Yeah, and I want to get paid.

00:07:18.729 --> 00:07:20.565
- You get paid.
- I get paid to stage.

00:07:20.565 --> 00:07:22.900
I want to get paid to work here.

00:07:23.276 --> 00:07:25.653
I feel like I've been working here.

00:07:25.653 --> 00:07:28.406
I did do some extra credit, though.

00:07:31.701 --> 00:07:34.287
It's, um... It's a lot of words.

00:07:34.495 --> 00:07:38.458
Yeah, but they... They basically say
we're getting killed on labor.

00:07:38.458 --> 00:07:41.169
We're open from 11:00 to 9:00.
That's dumb.

00:07:41.169 --> 00:07:45.339
We should be open from 11:00 to 2:00
for lunch and 5:00 to 9:00 for dinner.

00:07:46.215 --> 00:07:49.719
Not to mention spending money
on pretty high-end stuff.

00:07:49.886 --> 00:07:52.054
Farmer's market produce... It's...

00:07:52.138 --> 00:07:53.222
Is my hair on fire?

00:07:53.306 --> 00:07:54.390
Not yet, no.

00:07:54.474 --> 00:07:55.850
But you need help,

00:07:56.517 --> 00:07:58.436
and we do this...

00:07:58.436 --> 00:08:02.148
I mean, these savings, 20% of them
could cover my yearly salary.

00:08:02.356 --> 00:08:05.026
That's not even accounting
for other people, you know.

00:08:05.026 --> 00:08:06.652
Plus, we're sleeping on to-go's.

00:08:06.736 --> 00:08:08.779
- That's business sitting there.
- I know.

00:08:08.863 --> 00:08:11.574
We don't have the support system
for a fluid to-go system,

00:08:11.574 --> 00:08:15.411
- we need to figure out packaging.
- Packaging, right. On Page 27, randomly,

00:08:15.495 --> 00:08:18.956
there's actually some pretty
good layout of just that.

00:08:19.165 --> 00:08:21.876
- Page 27?
- Yeah, it's mostly graphics.

00:08:21.876 --> 00:08:23.503
Yo, Carm.

00:08:28.633 --> 00:08:29.717
Listen...

00:08:30.343 --> 00:08:33.846
No. I can handle this myself, cousin.
I got this.

00:08:34.347 --> 00:08:37.183
So... You're not Ron?

00:08:37.642 --> 00:08:39.769
Ron's gone. "Gone" gone.

00:08:39.936 --> 00:08:41.646
- Ron's dead?
- Who is Ron?

00:08:41.896 --> 00:08:43.564
My partner, Ron Pager.

00:08:43.648 --> 00:08:45.525
He passed away.
I'm running his routes now.

00:08:45.525 --> 00:08:48.361
- Everybody's dying.
- Nancy Chore, Chicago Board of Health.

00:08:48.361 --> 00:08:51.155
- I'm here to inspect the property.
- Hi. I'm Carmen Berzatto.

00:08:51.239 --> 00:08:53.741
- I'm the owner.
- He's the owner's brother actually.

00:08:53.741 --> 00:08:54.825
He's also dead.

00:08:54.951 --> 00:08:57.161
- He doesn't look dead.
- No, no, I'm not dead.

00:08:57.245 --> 00:08:59.247
- My brother's dead.
- I'm sorry to hear that.

00:08:59.247 --> 00:09:01.165
- Thank you.
- I'm sorry for your loss too.

00:09:01.249 --> 00:09:03.251
Can I see some kind of identification?

00:09:03.834 --> 00:09:04.835
Yeah.

00:09:08.339 --> 00:09:09.423
Interesting.

00:09:10.591 --> 00:09:12.552
Is it? What's interesting about that?

00:09:13.344 --> 00:09:15.972
It's an interesting logo on her badge.

00:09:15.972 --> 00:09:19.433
Nancy, you need anything, just find us.
Make yourself at home. Okay?

00:09:19.517 --> 00:09:21.227
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Thank you.

00:09:21.435 --> 00:09:22.853
Where's Tina and Ebra?

00:09:23.854 --> 00:09:26.440
- No funny business, Ms. Chore.
- You, too.

00:09:26.774 --> 00:09:27.775
Okay.

00:09:28.109 --> 00:09:32.405
I also noted on the prog that it's not
necessarily flour that's expensive,

00:09:32.405 --> 00:09:35.616
but the shipping, so we could just
have somebody go and pick it up.

00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:38.369
- Yeah, Marcus.
- Okay, sure. Marcus. Great.

00:09:38.494 --> 00:09:39.870
No, it can only be Marcus.

00:09:40.538 --> 00:09:42.373
Why can it only be Marcus?

00:09:42.373 --> 00:09:44.417
Sweeps, Tina, and Ebra don't drive.

00:09:46.210 --> 00:09:47.670
Well, what about Richie?

00:09:47.878 --> 00:09:48.921
Suspended license.

00:09:49.839 --> 00:09:51.591
I saw him drive in this morning.

00:09:51.591 --> 00:09:55.428
I'm telling you, beware of bitches
with little notebooks.

00:09:55.428 --> 00:09:57.054
Sydney walked in here few days ago,

00:09:57.138 --> 00:09:59.098
and now she's running shit
just like that?

00:09:59.223 --> 00:10:01.225
All fucking willowy and scribbling?

00:10:01.309 --> 00:10:03.978
"Chef, I would do anything
to work at Noma."

00:10:03.978 --> 00:10:06.147
Bitch, look around. This ain't Noma.

00:10:06.147 --> 00:10:08.733
The health inspector is coming in here,
and she's not nice.

00:10:08.733 --> 00:10:10.359
She's not your friend. She may smile,

00:10:10.443 --> 00:10:12.570
but don't see the teeth,
those are daggers.

00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:15.615
The point is, it's one of 100 things
we can be doing to save costs.

00:10:15.615 --> 00:10:16.782
Sydney. Sydney. Sydney.

00:10:16.866 --> 00:10:19.285
I'm sure this is all correct,
but it's a lot.

00:10:19.285 --> 00:10:22.830
The job you're describing goes way
outside what I can afford to pay a sous,

00:10:22.830 --> 00:10:24.373
which I can barely afford already.

00:10:24.457 --> 00:10:25.625
But I hear you. Okay?

00:10:26.542 --> 00:10:29.545
I have every intention of turning this
into an efficient,

00:10:29.629 --> 00:10:31.839
respectable place of business
run by adults.

00:10:32.590 --> 00:10:34.759
That's a fucking ass of shit!

00:10:35.176 --> 00:10:36.177
Eventually.

00:10:41.223 --> 00:10:43.559
Does anybody know how dangerous this is?

00:10:43.726 --> 00:10:45.061
Yo, what's going on?

00:10:45.061 --> 00:10:47.772
- It wasn't dangerous, Ms. Chore...
- What's dangerous?

00:10:47.772 --> 00:10:49.148
...until you pulled it out.

00:10:49.148 --> 00:10:51.317
I discovered
a large hole in the tile.

00:10:51.317 --> 00:10:54.070
Looks like a former gas line
next to the stove tops.

00:10:54.070 --> 00:10:57.156
Not only was it not properly
dry walled and caulked,

00:10:57.156 --> 00:11:00.493
but someone clogged the hole
with napkins and then proxied over it

00:11:00.618 --> 00:11:02.620
- with some kind of plastic.
- Don't look at me.

00:11:02.787 --> 00:11:06.290
Grease seeped into the napkins
and the proxy became unproxied.

00:11:06.374 --> 00:11:08.542
- What does that mean?
- A potential cross contaminate.

00:11:08.668 --> 00:11:11.045
Additionally, no hot water
in the hand station.

00:11:11.045 --> 00:11:15.091
Okay, well, that one, Ms. Chore,
I've told Chicago, Ron, this 100 times,

00:11:15.091 --> 00:11:17.593
you got to wait a minute
for it to warm up.

00:11:17.677 --> 00:11:20.054
- So if you can relax on that one.
- Or worse.

00:11:20.054 --> 00:11:22.932
Health code states
any sink near a prep area

00:11:22.932 --> 00:11:25.101
needs to deliver instantly hot water

00:11:25.101 --> 00:11:27.228
- to prevent the spread of bacteria.
- Yeah.

00:11:27.228 --> 00:11:29.188
I haven't even delivered
the big one yet.

00:11:29.188 --> 00:11:30.272
There's a big one?

00:11:30.398 --> 00:11:31.816
What is the big one?

00:11:31.816 --> 00:11:35.236
Someone left a pack of cigarettes
on the stovetop near the burners.

00:11:35.444 --> 00:11:39.699
Not only very dangerous,
but also a potential contaminant.

00:11:40.032 --> 00:11:41.951
- Motherfucker.
- You can say that again.

00:11:41.951 --> 00:11:44.578
- Motherfucker.
- Don't actually say it again, idiot.

00:11:44.662 --> 00:11:46.997
- You're about to get power washed.
- Yeah?

00:11:47.081 --> 00:11:50.960
Unfortunately, these violations
leave me no choice.

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:53.796
- I award you a C.
- No! No, no, no.

00:11:54.422 --> 00:11:56.549
- That's some bullshit.
- Just wait.

00:11:56.549 --> 00:11:58.801
Time out. Time out. Time out.
You know what?

00:11:58.801 --> 00:12:01.011
I'm gonna caulk that shit
right now, okay?

00:12:01.095 --> 00:12:04.598
It doesn't matter how fast you do it.
I can't come back to test for 30 days.

00:12:04.682 --> 00:12:06.934
It'll take five. No, no, no!
Don't touch that.

00:12:06.934 --> 00:12:08.728
It will take five seconds to caulk.

00:12:08.728 --> 00:12:11.063
I can caulk! Let me fucking caulk!

00:12:11.147 --> 00:12:12.773
- You should.
- There's no caulk in house.

00:12:12.857 --> 00:12:13.983
Shut the fuck up, Fak!

00:12:13.983 --> 00:12:15.234
See you all later.

00:12:17.319 --> 00:12:18.529
Shut the fuck up.

00:12:18.529 --> 00:12:21.949
I'm saying there's no caulk
in house. Dude, it's okay. We'll fix it.

00:12:23.701 --> 00:12:25.911
You're bitching me?
You wanna run this place?

00:12:25.995 --> 00:12:27.788
How do you know
they're not your cigarettes?

00:12:27.872 --> 00:12:29.498
'Cause I'm not a fucking dipshit!

00:12:31.584 --> 00:12:35.045
You put it in the fucking window!

00:12:35.212 --> 00:12:37.298
- You put it in the fucking window!
- Stop.

00:12:37.298 --> 00:12:38.841
Let's not do this.

00:12:38.841 --> 00:12:40.342
- All right.
- That's your C.

00:12:40.426 --> 00:12:42.052
Here's what we're gonna do.

00:12:42.136 --> 00:12:45.848
You're gonna go to the hardware store,
you're gonna get some joint compound.

00:12:45.848 --> 00:12:48.684
You're gonna get some caulk
and caulk that shit.

00:12:48.809 --> 00:12:50.227
Okay, well, FYI...

00:12:50.311 --> 00:12:52.521
- FYI...
- ...I'm not your fucking gofer.

00:12:52.605 --> 00:12:55.232
FYI, you cocked it up,
you're gonna caulk it out.

00:12:55.316 --> 00:12:59.195
Okay, well, I would love to,
but my license is expired, FYI.

00:12:59.195 --> 00:13:01.947
- You drove here this morning.
- Sydney, you wanna help?

00:13:02.031 --> 00:13:03.449
- You can take him.
- No.

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:06.619
- Time out. I'll Uber. Thank you.
- Grow up.

00:13:06.619 --> 00:13:08.579
- Thank you.
- Surge rates, fucko.

00:13:11.749 --> 00:13:15.586
- Richie?
- Fine, but we're taking my car.

00:13:16.420 --> 00:13:17.963
I... I don't care.

00:13:20.382 --> 00:13:22.343
He's that broke?
That took him out?

00:13:22.843 --> 00:13:24.470
I graduated with a C.

00:13:24.470 --> 00:13:25.763
We know.

00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:32.645
Fix that fucking sound.
Please fix that fucking sound!

00:13:32.645 --> 00:13:34.688
I will fix it. Fak always fixes it.

00:13:34.772 --> 00:13:36.982
Kids come in, break it, what happens?
I fix the balls.

00:13:37.066 --> 00:13:38.484
Fak always fixes the balls.

00:13:38.484 --> 00:13:40.194
- Fix it!
- I'll fix the balls!

00:13:45.115 --> 00:13:46.784
This is fucking bullshit.

00:13:49.537 --> 00:13:51.163
Can you, um... Can you hold this?

00:14:05.803 --> 00:14:07.513
You got... You got to wiggle it.

00:14:08.264 --> 00:14:10.850
Oh, okay. I should have known
that I had to wiggle it.

00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:13.435
That's on me. Doesn't mean
I don't know how to wiggle it.

00:14:13.519 --> 00:14:15.479
I wasn't expecting company, by the way.

00:14:15.563 --> 00:14:17.731
These Arby's cups
are from different visits.

00:14:18.816 --> 00:14:19.817
I respect that.

00:14:38.836 --> 00:14:39.879
Shit.

00:14:41.589 --> 00:14:43.048
Where is this shit?

00:14:44.008 --> 00:14:46.051
We can always talk to somebody
who works here.

00:14:46.176 --> 00:14:48.262
No, no, no, no. I can find this myself.

00:14:48.721 --> 00:14:49.805
I can't...

00:14:50.180 --> 00:14:53.726
I can't believe I'm taking orders
from a fucking toddler right now.

00:14:53.726 --> 00:14:55.978
My entire life,
I had to listen to everybody

00:14:55.978 --> 00:14:57.855
acting all worried
about him all the time.

00:14:57.855 --> 00:15:00.774
"He's a baby. Don't get Carmen
into trouble," you know.

00:15:00.858 --> 00:15:03.444
I was a baby, too, once, Sydney.
Nobody gave a fuck.

00:15:03.444 --> 00:15:05.696
Okay, I'm sorry about that.

00:15:05.821 --> 00:15:08.991
But none of that messed up the wall

00:15:08.991 --> 00:15:12.161
- that we're here to fix, so...
- Fuck that. He's giving me crap

00:15:12.328 --> 00:15:15.456
about not letting him work
at the restaurant when he was a kid.

00:15:15.456 --> 00:15:18.000
You think I give a fuck
where that dude works?

00:15:18.834 --> 00:15:19.877
Fucking Mikey.

00:15:19.877 --> 00:15:22.254
Why didn't Michael want him
to work at the restaurant?

00:15:22.379 --> 00:15:24.632
Because he's a little bitch probably.

00:15:27.468 --> 00:15:30.387
Can I ask? Like, what...

00:15:31.805 --> 00:15:33.807
What was, like, the deal with Michael?

00:15:35.142 --> 00:15:37.645
Yeah, he shot himself in the head
four months ago.

00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:40.898
Jesus. All right.

00:15:42.358 --> 00:15:44.526
Were... Were you guys, like,

00:15:44.610 --> 00:15:49.531
related on your mom's side
or, like, your dad's or...

00:15:49.657 --> 00:15:51.241
Neither. He was my best friend.

00:15:52.076 --> 00:15:54.787
Boom! There's that shit. Told you.

00:15:56.580 --> 00:16:01.293
"Silicone adhesive caulk."
"Acrylic caulk."

00:16:01.585 --> 00:16:04.546
Are you just reading
what's on the labels?

00:16:05.130 --> 00:16:07.383
Okay, we got rubber sealing...

00:16:07.383 --> 00:16:11.220
- I'm gonna find somebody who works here.
- No! I got this.

00:16:15.265 --> 00:16:18.936
And then, you know,
the produce bill is due, you know,

00:16:18.936 --> 00:16:22.982
and the power comes in
and I can't build enough of a parachute.

00:16:23.357 --> 00:16:27.236
Even if we got this place packed, that's
only like a week of survival cash.

00:16:27.236 --> 00:16:28.779
Exhausted listening to this.

00:16:30.072 --> 00:16:32.825
- You asked me what's going on.
- I asked you where you've been.

00:16:34.868 --> 00:16:37.121
You're looking at it.
This is where I've been.

00:16:37.371 --> 00:16:39.790
Carmen, this place is bullshit.

00:16:39.999 --> 00:16:42.167
Right? I mean,
you're never gonna fix it.

00:16:42.251 --> 00:16:44.169
You can't start at fucked.

00:16:44.837 --> 00:16:46.296
You understand that, right?

00:16:47.464 --> 00:16:48.799
Is that really a question?

00:16:48.799 --> 00:16:52.845
You're operating a business historically
has a lower success rate than...

00:16:52.845 --> 00:16:54.680
I don't know, Chicago fucking Bears.

00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:57.725
You're having a hard time
keeping vendors current, your crew paid,

00:16:57.725 --> 00:17:00.978
right, and we're not even getting
into the money I lent your brother.

00:17:03.605 --> 00:17:06.817
- Michael took money from you?
- He took a lot of money from me.

00:17:06.942 --> 00:17:11.488
I mean, cash infusions for this place,
term loans which he never paid back.

00:17:12.906 --> 00:17:14.658
Now I got to hold you responsible.

00:17:16.368 --> 00:17:17.453
Okay.

00:17:18.203 --> 00:17:20.581
How... How much?

00:17:22.082 --> 00:17:23.292
Three hundred grand.

00:17:24.877 --> 00:17:26.754
Jesus Christ, Jimmy.

00:17:26.879 --> 00:17:28.672
Jesus Christ is right, Carm.

00:17:29.173 --> 00:17:31.717
I mean, it's not like
he put it into this place.

00:17:32.468 --> 00:17:34.970
Still looks like some kid
painted it with his ass.

00:17:35.971 --> 00:17:38.932
Look, no disrespect.

00:17:39.016 --> 00:17:41.477
You know, your brother was an animal.

00:17:41.852 --> 00:17:44.480
Surrounded by dickheads,
and then he lost his mind,

00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:46.690
and now he put you in a real tough spot.

00:17:48.567 --> 00:17:50.069
That's why you stopped by?

00:17:51.195 --> 00:17:52.529
I stopped by to see you.

00:17:53.405 --> 00:17:57.201
Should've stopped by to break your legs,
but I guess I'm becoming forgetful.

00:17:59.828 --> 00:18:01.371
Why'd you give him the money?

00:18:02.372 --> 00:18:03.791
Very good question.

00:18:03.791 --> 00:18:07.127
You know, I don't know, he said
he's gonna franchise the place

00:18:07.211 --> 00:18:08.879
but you knew that was bullshit.

00:18:09.797 --> 00:18:11.090
You still gave it to him.

00:18:12.633 --> 00:18:13.842
I loved him, too.

00:18:18.097 --> 00:18:21.517
Look, well,
let's just do the easy thing here

00:18:22.226 --> 00:18:23.435
and you sell it to me.

00:18:25.854 --> 00:18:28.816
No. No, you just said
restaurants are bad for business.

00:18:28.816 --> 00:18:30.776
Who says I'm gonna keep it a restaurant?

00:18:32.569 --> 00:18:34.488
I'll get you the money, Jimmy.

00:18:36.740 --> 00:18:38.158
All right, I promise you.

00:18:42.412 --> 00:18:45.082
Shit. We're gonna be in gridlock
for over an hour

00:18:45.082 --> 00:18:46.875
because of your new best friend.

00:18:46.959 --> 00:18:47.960
Okay, well...

00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:50.838
I don't even know why
you wanna work for that little stunod.

00:18:51.421 --> 00:18:53.632
-'Cause he's good.
- Oh, my God.

00:18:53.632 --> 00:18:56.718
Like, whether you like it or not,
he's incredibly talented,

00:18:56.802 --> 00:18:58.720
and we could all learn a lot from him.

00:18:58.804 --> 00:19:02.432
You know, he was one of <i>Food &amp; Wine's</i>
Best New Chefs when he was 21.

00:19:02.516 --> 00:19:06.645
Oh, my God, he was one of
<i>Food &amp; Wine's</i> Best New Chefs?

00:19:06.854 --> 00:19:09.606
Is that what you just told me?
That changes everything.

00:19:09.731 --> 00:19:11.817
Really good short term memory, Richie.

00:19:12.025 --> 00:19:13.193
Congrats on that.

00:19:15.612 --> 00:19:17.823
You know the restaurant could be good.

00:19:18.949 --> 00:19:20.951
Like, I know you know that.

00:19:21.451 --> 00:19:23.954
It doesn't have to be a place
where the food is shitty,

00:19:23.954 --> 00:19:26.248
where everybody acts shitty
and feels shitty.

00:19:26.248 --> 00:19:27.916
It could be a good legit spot.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:29.751
You're getting a little aggressive.

00:19:29.835 --> 00:19:32.671
And I think maybe you should
just pause and take a breath

00:19:32.671 --> 00:19:35.799
before you start driving.
Man or woman, I'm not discriminating.

00:19:35.883 --> 00:19:38.969
It's dangerous to get behind the wheel
when you're hysterical.

00:19:38.969 --> 00:19:41.513
- Why the fuck does she keep calling?

00:19:41.597 --> 00:19:43.974
- Hey, why do you keep calling me?
- Fuck me.

00:19:45.142 --> 00:19:46.476
What's going on with her?

00:19:49.146 --> 00:19:50.230
Is she crying again?

00:19:53.692 --> 00:19:55.027
What did you say?

00:19:56.862 --> 00:19:59.448
Well, I'd be crying, too.

00:19:59.448 --> 00:20:03.160
She's at this different school,
and those kids are a bunch of fuckfaces.

00:20:04.661 --> 00:20:07.247
Hold on. Hold on!

00:20:08.957 --> 00:20:10.584
Can I just talk to her, please?

00:20:14.004 --> 00:20:15.255
Hey, sweetie.

00:20:15.339 --> 00:20:16.590
How are you doing?

00:20:17.216 --> 00:20:18.592
You're not doing so good?

00:20:20.344 --> 00:20:21.595
What's wrong?

00:20:24.681 --> 00:20:25.933
Oh, you're scared?

00:20:28.685 --> 00:20:30.020
What are you scared about?

00:20:32.064 --> 00:20:35.150
Yeah, I get it.

00:20:36.902 --> 00:20:39.947
But you know what,
you're going to do great.

00:20:40.364 --> 00:20:41.657
I promise.

00:20:42.616 --> 00:20:44.785
And if you don't,
I'm gonna give you $500.

00:20:46.578 --> 00:20:48.038
But you're gonna do great.

00:20:49.665 --> 00:20:51.750
And I'm gonna see you on Friday, right?

00:20:53.377 --> 00:20:54.378
Of...

00:20:54.878 --> 00:20:56.171
How could you...

00:20:57.089 --> 00:20:59.258
Of course I still love you.

00:20:59.758 --> 00:21:01.134
I love you so, so much.

00:21:01.218 --> 00:21:04.179
I love you more and more every day,
if that's possible.

00:21:04.304 --> 00:21:05.722
I just...

00:21:06.890 --> 00:21:07.933
No.

00:21:08.475 --> 00:21:10.060
I don't need to talk to Mommy.

00:21:11.270 --> 00:21:14.773
But call me after, you know,
let me know how it went.

00:21:17.150 --> 00:21:20.362
Okay. I'm so proud of you, kiddo.

00:21:22.864 --> 00:21:23.991
I love you.

00:21:28.328 --> 00:21:31.957
I'm sorry. My...
My daughter's going through a phase.

00:21:32.916 --> 00:21:34.001
Yeah.

00:21:36.253 --> 00:21:37.629
How old is she?

00:21:38.922 --> 00:21:40.173
She's five.

00:21:41.591 --> 00:21:42.592
Like Carmy.

00:21:43.719 --> 00:21:45.721
<i>Food &amp; Wine's</i> best new dickhead.

00:21:54.021 --> 00:21:55.188
Fuck!

00:21:55.939 --> 00:21:57.774
I fucked up with those cigarettes.

00:22:04.323 --> 00:22:07.492
I'm sorry about Michael.

00:22:12.456 --> 00:22:14.458
And I got the wrong caulk, I think.

00:22:18.462 --> 00:22:19.671
You did.

00:22:22.632 --> 00:22:25.344
But I didn't.

00:22:28.805 --> 00:22:30.057
Oh, shit.

00:22:31.266 --> 00:22:33.769
- Syd making moves.
- Fuck off, Richie.

00:23:07.844 --> 00:23:09.679
- Carm?
- Hey, Pete.

00:23:10.138 --> 00:23:11.431
<i>Hey.</i>

00:23:11.890 --> 00:23:13.934
- Everything okay?
- Yeah. No, I'm good.

00:23:13.934 --> 00:23:16.561
I just...
Sugar wasn't picking up her phone.

00:23:16.770 --> 00:23:17.771
Oh.

00:23:19.356 --> 00:23:21.400
- Look, I was just...
- Hold on. Hold on.

00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:22.567
Let me get Nat.

00:23:22.651 --> 00:23:25.195
- No. I just... I'm sorry, I...
- Nat?

00:23:25.195 --> 00:23:27.280
I wanted to talk to you about something.

00:23:27.447 --> 00:23:28.782
I wanted to apologize...

00:23:29.324 --> 00:23:30.325
Oh.

00:23:30.867 --> 00:23:31.868
...for last time.

00:23:31.952 --> 00:23:35.497
I went to urgent care and they gave me
some stuff to put on it, and...

00:23:35.497 --> 00:23:36.706
No, I shouldn't...

00:23:36.790 --> 00:23:38.667
Hey, Nat. Hold on, let me grab her.

00:23:38.792 --> 00:23:40.252
- Okay.
- Let me get her, one second.

00:23:40.252 --> 00:23:42.712
- No problem. No problem.
- What?

00:23:42.879 --> 00:23:44.756
- What is going on?
- It's Carmy.

00:23:45.424 --> 00:23:47.300
- Why is he calling you?
- I don't know.

00:23:48.552 --> 00:23:51.221
- You calling Pete?
- <i>You won't pick up the phone.</i>

00:23:51.346 --> 00:23:52.389
I'm making dinner.

00:23:52.973 --> 00:23:54.307
Did you hear I apologized?

00:23:55.016 --> 00:23:57.477
- So?
- <i>Cicero was here.</i>

00:23:57.978 --> 00:24:01.064
Yeah, I heard.
I also heard there's a C in the window.

00:24:01.148 --> 00:24:02.190
Nice.

00:24:02.274 --> 00:24:03.275
<i>Listen, Sugar...</i>

00:24:04.568 --> 00:24:07.279
I woke up in at night
cooking some wrapped frozen shit,

00:24:07.279 --> 00:24:09.072
I almost set my apartment on fire.

00:24:11.992 --> 00:24:13.702
Does that happen a lot?

00:24:14.828 --> 00:24:15.829
<i>Sometimes.</i>

00:24:18.498 --> 00:24:19.958
Did you look at the thing?

00:24:20.167 --> 00:24:21.751
No, I didn't look at the thing.

00:24:21.835 --> 00:24:25.172
<i>Pete and I have been going lately,
and it's actually been really nice.</i>

00:24:25.172 --> 00:24:27.716
- Yeah, of course Pete would go.
- Shut the fuck up.

00:24:28.508 --> 00:24:31.219
- You want me to shut the fuck up?
- Not you, sweetie.

00:24:31.511 --> 00:24:34.014
- You didn't say anything.
- Copy that.

00:24:34.681 --> 00:24:37.684
- What are you making?
- <i>Mom's chicken.</i>

00:24:40.270 --> 00:24:43.190
Look, I'm... I'm fine.

00:24:44.357 --> 00:24:47.235
Really, you know,
I just have trouble breathing sometimes,

00:24:47.319 --> 00:24:49.404
- and I wake up screaming.
- <i>What?</i>

00:24:49.488 --> 00:24:51.740
I know tons of people
that cry out of nowhere.

00:24:52.449 --> 00:24:54.159
Okay, I just sent it to you again.

00:24:54.743 --> 00:24:56.286
I don't want to bother you.

00:24:56.661 --> 00:24:58.246
No, you're not bothering me.

00:24:58.330 --> 00:25:00.165
But that isn't like unscary.

00:25:00.624 --> 00:25:02.542
When did the breathing problem start?

00:25:04.085 --> 00:25:05.879
I think maybe sometime in New York.

00:25:07.130 --> 00:25:09.341
I was throwing up every day before work.

00:25:09.758 --> 00:25:11.426
Okay, well, that sounds chill.

00:25:12.385 --> 00:25:13.553
<i>I kind of dug it.</i>

00:25:13.929 --> 00:25:15.430
You dug throwing up?

00:25:15.514 --> 00:25:17.891
No, no, no. It was awful.

00:25:18.058 --> 00:25:19.392
Chef was a piece of shit.

00:25:20.101 --> 00:25:22.103
<i>Then why'd you stay there?</i>

00:25:25.732 --> 00:25:26.942
I don't know. Um...

00:25:29.194 --> 00:25:30.612
People loved the food.

00:25:32.113 --> 00:25:33.156
It felt good.

00:25:34.032 --> 00:25:38.495
Chefs always say a big part of the job
is taking care of people, right?

00:25:39.329 --> 00:25:40.956
<i>Yeah, yeah. No, I guess.</i>

00:25:40.956 --> 00:25:44.417
You can't really do that if you're not
taking care of yourself then.

00:25:45.001 --> 00:25:47.170
<i>And I like when you tell me things.</i>

00:25:47.587 --> 00:25:50.549
<i>Just... I'm asking you
to look at the thing.</i>

00:25:50.715 --> 00:25:51.716
Mmm-hmm.

00:25:52.634 --> 00:25:54.177
It's okay to ask for help.

00:25:57.556 --> 00:25:59.808
I understand. I do.

00:26:03.853 --> 00:26:05.146
Okay.

00:26:23.290 --> 00:26:24.457
Yes.

00:26:56.281 --> 00:26:57.866
Yo, we need you out front.

00:26:58.199 --> 00:27:01.202
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'll be right there.

00:27:57.592 --> 00:28:01.596
Chef, let's fire. Two chicken pepper.
Two sausage pepper. Two mortadella.

00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:04.599

Two mortadella, chef.

One more sausage pepper.
One more mortadella, chef.

00:28:13.900 --> 00:28:16.403
Could go a little heavier
on the lettuce, I feel.

00:28:19.614 --> 00:28:20.949
- It's heavier.
- Yeah.

00:28:26.746 --> 00:28:27.956
Pretty, thank you, chef.

00:28:27.956 --> 00:28:31.126
Okay, let's fire one more
sausage pepper. Two more mortadella.

00:28:31.126 --> 00:28:33.253
One more sausage pepper.
One more mortadella.

00:28:33.253 --> 00:28:35.046
- Two mortadella.
- Two mortadella, chef.

00:28:35.130 --> 00:28:36.548
Gorgeous. Thank you, chef.

00:28:38.007 --> 00:28:40.593
- Wanna line change?
- No, no, no, no. Open up.

00:28:41.219 --> 00:28:42.220
Okay.

00:28:42.637 --> 00:28:45.223
- Thank you for taking Richie today.
- Oh! Yeah. No sweat.

00:28:47.350 --> 00:28:49.185
Do you want me to come in tomorrow?

00:28:49.644 --> 00:28:51.271
Please. Yeah, you're hired.

00:28:51.813 --> 00:28:55.483
- Yeah?
- Yes. You're pass chef.

00:28:56.317 --> 00:28:57.402
Thank you, chef.

00:28:58.194 --> 00:28:59.654
Can I get hands, please?

00:29:00.655 --> 00:29:04.784 line:20%
- And fire one more sausage pepper.
- One more sausage pepper, chef.

00:29:04.868 --> 00:29:05.869 line:20%
Thank you, chef.

00:29:10.957 --> 00:29:13.293
Yo! You fixed that hole?

00:29:13.668 --> 00:29:16.671
Yeah. Yeah.
Is the Health Department coming back?

00:29:17.046 --> 00:29:18.381
Yeah. Yeah, I think so.

00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:20.592
- Fucking Cicero.
- Cicero.

00:29:22.844 --> 00:29:24.554

Yeah, I'm just gonna burn one,
haven't had one all day.

- I'll see you a sec, all right?
- Yeah.

00:29:55.043 --> 00:29:56.169
Fuck!
