WEBVTT

00:00:49.966 --> 00:00:51.217
<i>Let it rip, buddy.</i>

00:00:55.638 --> 00:00:59.934
<i>It's hard to hear it,
so I just keep saying it.</i>

00:01:01.644 --> 00:01:04.731
I didn't cause it, I can't control it,

00:01:05.982 --> 00:01:07.317
I can't cure it.

00:01:15.033 --> 00:01:19.329
A lot of my life,
I thought I was just a victim.

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:25.752
Because my husband drank so much,
this would happen or that would happen.

00:01:28.254 --> 00:01:31.382
The short term was always so awful.

00:01:31.466 --> 00:01:34.928
I thought
if I just could throw out his liquor,

00:01:34.928 --> 00:01:38.306
hide whatever he was on,
that would fix it.

00:01:40.058 --> 00:01:44.896
You can't curb that kind of chaos
until the thinking changes,

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:49.442
until the foundations change,

00:01:51.194 --> 00:01:53.154
until the chemistry changes.

00:01:54.114 --> 00:01:55.281
And it's difficult.

00:01:56.616 --> 00:02:00.161
I know I played a part in his abuse.

00:02:02.747 --> 00:02:04.666
And I'm really mad at myself for that.

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:06.751
But...

00:02:09.337 --> 00:02:13.091
But if there's anything good
that came out of it,

00:02:14.342 --> 00:02:17.303
it's that it made me realize
that the best thing for me to do

00:02:18.513 --> 00:02:21.516
is just to try to keep
my side of the street clean.

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:28.481
Instead of trying to fix everything,
just remove myself from any situation

00:02:28.565 --> 00:02:32.610
that is or could become toxic.

00:02:38.032 --> 00:02:39.909
What is wrong with you fucking jagoffs?

00:02:39.993 --> 00:02:42.954
We're down six sausage pepper,
five Greeks and a ravioli! Let's go!

00:02:42.954 --> 00:02:45.248
We are down
that because you are not firing.

00:02:45.415 --> 00:02:47.458
Are you out of your mind?

00:02:47.542 --> 00:02:49.085
I'm firing like a fucking maniac.

00:02:50.837 --> 00:02:52.338
Waiting on those peppers, Chef.

00:02:52.422 --> 00:02:54.549
These guys have to pick up their orders!

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:56.551
- Chef, I need chits.
- What chits?

00:02:56.551 --> 00:02:59.012
Listen to the words
coming out of my fucking mouth.

00:02:59.012 --> 00:03:02.056
- Are you listening to me?
- Chef, lower your voice, please.

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.559
Thank you. So sorry, guys.
Thank you for your patience.

00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:06.895
Corner. Who took my trays?
Again, that's theft.

00:03:06.895 --> 00:03:08.521
Nobody took them. I prepped them.

00:03:08.605 --> 00:03:11.691
- They're in the oven, ready for you.
- Behind.

00:03:11.691 --> 00:03:14.652
- The ketchup is right there.
- Waiting on those peppers, please.

00:03:14.736 --> 00:03:17.113
Yo. Cisco, let's rock, baby.
What do you want?

00:03:17.197 --> 00:03:18.448
Can I get two dogs with everything?

00:03:18.448 --> 00:03:19.699
Two dogs.

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:21.910
Stop shouting, please. Press the button.

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:23.912
Sydney, head in the game.

00:03:23.912 --> 00:03:25.246
- Stop shouting.
- Are you crazy?

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:27.957
- Learn how to use a fucking computer.
- Chef, are you good?

00:03:28.458 --> 00:03:29.918
- Yes, Chef.
- Yes?

00:03:29.918 --> 00:03:31.044
Yes, Chef.

00:03:31.044 --> 00:03:32.629
- Thank you, Chef.
- Thank you, Chef.

00:03:32.795 --> 00:03:34.172
- Stop!
- 5.25, sir.

00:03:34.172 --> 00:03:36.132
- The chits.
- Let's go!

00:03:36.216 --> 00:03:37.759
- Not enough pepper.
- Move it down.

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:39.761
Blossom, what am I
getting today, mortadellas?

00:03:39.761 --> 00:03:42.222
I have to cut more peppers.
I don't have any more here.

00:04:46.077 --> 00:04:48.830
- Hey. Good morning, chefs.

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:50.415
- Hello, Carmy.
- Good morning, Chef.

00:04:50.415 --> 00:04:52.208
Chef, what are you doing so early?

00:04:52.292 --> 00:04:53.835
I could not sleep.

00:04:58.589 --> 00:04:59.674
Oh!

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:02.176
Getting flashbacks.

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:03.970
I copied them out of your books.

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:05.888 line:20%
If it's too much, I could take it down.

00:05:06.597 --> 00:05:08.599
No. Looks good.

00:05:08.683 --> 00:05:10.768
The colors are wild.
It gets me thinking.

00:05:10.852 --> 00:05:12.395
- Hi.
- Morning, Chef.

00:05:12.395 --> 00:05:14.063
Yeah, totally.

00:05:16.316 --> 00:05:19.402
You know it takes 12 people
to prep that?

00:05:19.402 --> 00:05:22.322
- Wow.
- Yeah. I plated that every night.

00:05:22.322 --> 00:05:23.573
Hold on 17, Chef.

00:05:23.573 --> 00:05:26.492
- There's four sets of plum in that.
- What do you mean?

00:05:26.576 --> 00:05:28.703
- There's plum wine.
- Plum wine?

00:05:29.412 --> 00:05:32.332
Yeah, it's a sweet wine from Japan,

00:05:32.332 --> 00:05:35.293
and you take a ton of bottles of it,
and you just boil it.

00:05:35.918 --> 00:05:40.548
You just cook it, and you cook it
until it becomes a syrup.

00:05:40.882 --> 00:05:42.342
It takes hours.

00:05:42.342 --> 00:05:44.886
Two shifts, two different people
just watching that shit.

00:05:45.011 --> 00:05:46.012
Yes, Chef.

00:05:46.012 --> 00:05:47.555
And you have your plum consomme,

00:05:47.555 --> 00:05:51.351
which is black plums
cooked down with black vinegar,

00:05:51.351 --> 00:05:52.977
salt, sugar.

00:05:53.061 --> 00:05:56.105
Somebody's got to be stirring that
forever so the sugar doesn't burn.

00:05:56.189 --> 00:06:00.109
And then your compressed plums,
which are these perfect fresh plums

00:06:00.193 --> 00:06:02.111
cut into perfect
four centimeter squares,

00:06:02.195 --> 00:06:03.988
that you cover
with the reduced plum wine,

00:06:04.572 --> 00:06:06.157
you vacuum seal it.

00:06:06.783 --> 00:06:08.451
Then you take your consomme, make gelee.

00:06:09.994 --> 00:06:12.163
At this place, the chef wanted the gelee

00:06:12.163 --> 00:06:14.540
to be like the consistency
of Haribo gummy bears,

00:06:14.624 --> 00:06:16.751
which we could never do.

00:06:16.751 --> 00:06:18.836
So, thick and chewy?

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:22.715
Yeah, thick but also squishy.

00:06:22.799 --> 00:06:24.342
Not too squishy.

00:06:25.009 --> 00:06:27.053
No one could do it.
It was always too soft,

00:06:27.053 --> 00:06:30.640
it was too hard, or it would melt
too quickly, or it was too gummy.

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:36.687
And then, one day,
a sous chef, he just hit it.

00:06:37.563 --> 00:06:40.233
He spent every minute of a year
trying to figure it out.

00:06:40.233 --> 00:06:41.359
So, how did he do it?

00:06:41.359 --> 00:06:42.527
- Well...
- Veal fat.

00:06:42.527 --> 00:06:43.653
What?

00:06:44.654 --> 00:06:47.073
Veal fat congeals when it's cold.

00:06:47.281 --> 00:06:50.201
- So...
- Yeah. No, that's right.

00:06:50.201 --> 00:06:51.327
So fire.

00:06:51.702 --> 00:06:54.163
Fuck, man. Mission accomplished.

00:06:54.622 --> 00:06:56.374
- Yeah.
- Let me get that for you.

00:06:56.374 --> 00:06:57.750
- No, I'm okay.
- You sure?

00:06:57.834 --> 00:06:59.127
Yes. Thanks.

00:06:59.419 --> 00:07:01.462
Uh, Sydney,
can I talk to you in my office?

00:07:01.587 --> 00:07:03.089
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

00:07:03.714 --> 00:07:04.799
Um...

00:07:05.633 --> 00:07:09.011
- So, last week was a nightmare.
- Yes, I agree.

00:07:09.095 --> 00:07:11.639
- We have to stop it, or it'll get worse.
- I agree.

00:07:11.639 --> 00:07:14.475
I think that... Actually, one sec.
Sorry. Yo, Ebra!

00:07:14.809 --> 00:07:17.895
Hey, any reason Michael
wasn't ordering number tens of these?

00:07:18.771 --> 00:07:20.106
English, Carmy.

00:07:20.106 --> 00:07:21.691
Okay, this is a 28-ounce can, right?

00:07:21.691 --> 00:07:24.444
So why wasn't Michael buying
number tens, which are 102 ounces?

00:07:24.444 --> 00:07:25.736
They're cheaper.

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:29.407
The more I learn about Michael,
the less I understand.

00:07:29.407 --> 00:07:31.117
Rest in peace, young man.

00:07:31.659 --> 00:07:33.786
Who cares? We don't use tomatoes anyway.

00:07:34.078 --> 00:07:36.831
- Um, hat did you have in mind? Sorry.

00:07:36.831 --> 00:07:39.500
Old-school brigade. You run it.

00:07:41.085 --> 00:07:43.629
- Respectfully, no.
- You told me that's what you wanted.

00:07:43.713 --> 00:07:45.798
No, I said I wanted more to do.

00:07:45.882 --> 00:07:47.508
I didn't say I want to run

00:07:47.592 --> 00:07:49.093
- a Russian gymnastics program.
- No.

00:07:49.177 --> 00:07:50.470
It's defining roles, right?

00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:53.222
It's creating a better workflow.
You're used to that.

00:07:53.306 --> 00:07:55.516
- It doesn't mean I liked it.
- It's a start.

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:58.060
- It's a mistake.
- It'll help.

00:07:58.144 --> 00:08:00.605
It'll create
a toxic hierarchical shit show.

00:08:00.605 --> 00:08:02.106
What is it now?

00:08:03.774 --> 00:08:04.775
A shit show.

00:08:04.859 --> 00:08:08.196
But with that type of system,
I'd have even less of a voice.

00:08:08.196 --> 00:08:10.072
- You'd have more of a headache...
- No.

00:08:10.156 --> 00:08:11.949
- Yeah.
- We can do it differently, okay?

00:08:12.033 --> 00:08:14.368
I cannot keep yelling at them every day.

00:08:14.452 --> 00:08:15.453
We have to cut it out.

00:08:15.453 --> 00:08:17.747
We have to change the chemistry,
all right?

00:08:18.664 --> 00:08:19.665
Yeah, but...

00:08:19.749 --> 00:08:21.250
We want to
change this restaurant, right?

00:08:22.168 --> 00:08:23.252
Right.

00:08:23.461 --> 00:08:26.756
I will dial business.
You are everything else.

00:08:28.549 --> 00:08:29.884
Let's try it.

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:32.803
Okay, yes. Okay, Chef.

00:08:32.887 --> 00:08:34.222
Great. Let's go.

00:08:34.931 --> 00:08:37.934
- Now? Now?
- Yeah, now.

00:08:37.934 --> 00:08:40.311
Okay, everybody, go ahead, grab one.

00:08:40.937 --> 00:08:42.313
Nice shit, Carm. Nice shit.

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:45.483
- Hey, Carm, the phone's ringing.
- Yep. I hear that. Thank you, Marcus.

00:08:45.483 --> 00:08:48.069
Manny, Angel, go ahead.
You grab one, too.

00:08:48.069 --> 00:08:49.820
We're going to look like a team.

00:08:49.904 --> 00:08:50.947
- Cool, boss.
- Yes.

00:08:50.947 --> 00:08:53.199
- Mine is better, Jeff.
- Okay.

00:08:53.199 --> 00:08:56.160
I'm gonna hand it over to Chef Sydney
in just a second.

00:08:56.244 --> 00:08:57.453
But first, uh...

00:08:59.872 --> 00:09:01.624
Okay, look,
I'm not trying to be an asshole

00:09:01.624 --> 00:09:03.918
and change your guys' system, okay?

00:09:03.918 --> 00:09:05.461
I don't want to fuck it up,

00:09:05.545 --> 00:09:08.756
I don't want to meddle with it
or whatever the fuck, all right?

00:09:08.756 --> 00:09:12.218
I want to harness it.

00:09:12.218 --> 00:09:15.346
Okay, seriously, I wanna organize it.

00:09:15.346 --> 00:09:18.516
We can't keep operating like this.
We got a "C."

00:09:19.392 --> 00:09:24.313
Guys, "C" stands for chaos.
That can't happen again.

00:09:26.232 --> 00:09:30.111
And that's why we are going to start
operating like a French kitchen.

00:09:30.111 --> 00:09:32.446
That means there's going to be
a chain of command.

00:09:33.114 --> 00:09:35.783
Okay? This was developed
by Escoffier, and I think...

00:09:35.783 --> 00:09:37.535
Escoffi-gay?

00:09:38.995 --> 00:09:40.288
Love that dude.

00:09:41.205 --> 00:09:44.041
- What's going on?
- We're implementing a French brigade.

00:09:44.125 --> 00:09:46.377
Mmm. Got it. Cool.

00:09:47.295 --> 00:09:48.713
Yeah.

00:09:48.921 --> 00:09:50.965
- Fuck that.
- That's bullshit.

00:09:53.634 --> 00:09:55.845
- Okay.
- Carmen, no.

00:09:56.762 --> 00:09:59.515
- I was in a brigade once.
- What happened?

00:10:00.182 --> 00:10:01.601
Many people died.

00:10:02.018 --> 00:10:03.352
- See?
- Okay. This is...

00:10:03.436 --> 00:10:04.437
It'll be different.

00:10:04.437 --> 00:10:06.022
All right, look, this is...

00:10:06.022 --> 00:10:10.318
This is what real kitchens do.
Guys, this is what real teams do.

00:10:10.484 --> 00:10:12.361
Everybody takes care of their station,

00:10:12.445 --> 00:10:14.989
they keep their own side
of the street clean.

00:10:17.074 --> 00:10:19.243
Yeah? Okay.

00:10:19.327 --> 00:10:21.579
I am going to go get that phone. Um...

00:10:21.579 --> 00:10:23.831
But you are in good hands.

00:10:23.831 --> 00:10:26.125
Uh, take it away, Chef. Thank you, guys.

00:10:28.711 --> 00:10:32.089
Okay. So, as you may have heard,

00:10:32.173 --> 00:10:36.552
we are implementing a French brigade.

00:10:36.636 --> 00:10:38.054
We all heard that. Right.

00:10:38.054 --> 00:10:41.015
So, Carmy is the head chef guy.

00:10:41.015 --> 00:10:43.726
He's the chef de cuisine, or the CDC.

00:10:43.726 --> 00:10:45.353
Uh, I would be...

00:10:45.353 --> 00:10:47.396
I am the sous.

00:10:47.563 --> 00:10:48.731
Like hierarchied.

00:10:48.731 --> 00:10:51.817
More just like a regular, chill archy.

00:10:52.401 --> 00:10:56.447
It's more about dividing labor.
Because I'm the sous, right,

00:10:56.447 --> 00:10:58.115
I just follow orders,

00:10:58.199 --> 00:11:01.535
even if it leads to tension
and chaos and resentment,

00:11:01.619 --> 00:11:04.121
and ultimately, doesn't work.
But that's what I do.

00:11:04.205 --> 00:11:05.790
Sorry. I'm the sous.

00:11:05.790 --> 00:11:08.417
- Tina, you are the...
- No <i>ingles.</i>

00:11:08.501 --> 00:11:10.586
I know you speak English.
I've heard you.

00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:13.422
You spoke English five seconds ago.
You're the garde manger.

00:11:13.506 --> 00:11:15.174
- Ebra...
- Meat prep.

00:11:15.841 --> 00:11:19.261
Yes, which means you are now
the chef de partie.

00:11:19.345 --> 00:11:20.346
Chef de partie.

00:11:20.846 --> 00:11:22.348
Yes.

00:11:22.598 --> 00:11:23.599
I accept.

00:11:27.103 --> 00:11:29.855
Hey, this The Beef.
Sorry about that. How can I help you?

00:11:29.939 --> 00:11:30.940
<i>Michael around?</i>

00:11:34.652 --> 00:11:36.028
<i>Hello?</i>

00:11:36.153 --> 00:11:38.447
Uh, no. He's not here this second.

00:11:38.656 --> 00:11:41.283
Um, can I ask who's calling?

00:11:41.367 --> 00:11:43.285
<i>Tell him Nico called. He's got my info.</i>

00:11:44.954 --> 00:11:46.205
Okay, Nico.

00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:49.625
Sorry... Hello?

00:11:52.002 --> 00:11:53.003
Who was that?

00:11:55.965 --> 00:11:58.968
Yo, Carmen, who was that?

00:12:00.594 --> 00:12:01.679
Um...

00:12:03.597 --> 00:12:05.307
Some dude asking for Michael.

00:12:07.101 --> 00:12:08.269
Uh...

00:12:08.894 --> 00:12:10.312
Who?

00:12:10.396 --> 00:12:11.397
Nico.

00:12:14.066 --> 00:12:16.193
All right. I'll hit him.

00:12:17.862 --> 00:12:19.655
- What's that about?
- He's some idiot.

00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:21.365
I got it. Don't worry about it.

00:12:24.243 --> 00:12:26.245
What's up? You blow a fuse or something?

00:12:28.497 --> 00:12:30.916
No, I just... I felt like
Michael was alive for a second.

00:12:37.173 --> 00:12:38.507
No, thanks.

00:12:58.778 --> 00:13:00.154
Okay, Marcus, you'll be...

00:13:00.154 --> 00:13:01.989
- Patissier?
- Yes, exactly.

00:13:01.989 --> 00:13:05.326
I really could start
fucking shit up if we source the bread.

00:13:05.326 --> 00:13:07.661
- Not a bad idea.
- I could light up a chocolate cake.

00:13:07.745 --> 00:13:09.705
- Five bucks a slice.
- Six bucks with ice cream.

00:13:10.289 --> 00:13:11.290
Okay.

00:13:11.624 --> 00:13:13.876
- Do you have a recipe?
- No, Chef, but I can learn.

00:13:13.876 --> 00:13:15.503
Make us more oven space as well.

00:13:15.711 --> 00:13:17.463
- Yeah.
- Yeah. I like this brigade.

00:13:17.588 --> 00:13:19.673
Okay, I will be saucier,

00:13:19.757 --> 00:13:23.010
which means I'll do gravies, stocks,
that sort of thing.

00:13:23.010 --> 00:13:25.554
Richie is doing
whatever the fuck Richie does.

00:13:25.638 --> 00:13:28.265
Um, every day, we'll start
with a pre-shift meeting,

00:13:28.599 --> 00:13:30.601
then we'll do a front-of-house
walk-through,

00:13:30.601 --> 00:13:32.228
then an end-of-day review.

00:13:32.353 --> 00:13:33.771
We just talk about things,

00:13:33.771 --> 00:13:35.648
see what we can do better,
more efficiently.

00:13:36.273 --> 00:13:38.818
I know it seems like a lot
and kind of annoying,

00:13:38.818 --> 00:13:41.862
but I promise this type of structure
will be super helpful.

00:13:41.946 --> 00:13:45.074
It'll make things run smoother, calmer.

00:13:45.407 --> 00:13:49.912
I gotta run an errand. Could you
hold down the fort? Thank you, Chef.

00:13:50.704 --> 00:13:53.541
Just like that.

00:14:47.136 --> 00:14:50.639
Okay. So I'm gonna do
checks in a second, so just, you know...

00:14:59.315 --> 00:15:02.151
Okay. Looks good in here.
We got this. So...

00:15:03.235 --> 00:15:04.695
Corner.

00:15:05.362 --> 00:15:07.489
Chef, you're supposed to be
prepping vegetables.

00:15:07.573 --> 00:15:09.658
- You're not my Jeff.
- Okay, today, I am,

00:15:09.742 --> 00:15:11.869
- so can you please just...
- Relax. I'll do it.

00:15:11.869 --> 00:15:13.704
Relax. Chill.

00:15:14.413 --> 00:15:16.415
Behind. Hey, Chef,
what's the family meal?

00:15:16.415 --> 00:15:19.668
Chicken sugara, using as few
oven pans as possible.

00:15:19.752 --> 00:15:21.045
Great. Thank you.

00:15:21.045 --> 00:15:22.379
- Behind.
- One of them

00:15:22.463 --> 00:15:24.298
- was like some gummy bear shit.
- Corner.

00:15:24.298 --> 00:15:26.300
- Okay, so it tastes like...
- Behind.

00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:28.886
- Yeah. But different level.
- Behind, Chef.

00:15:28.886 --> 00:15:29.970
- Come on.
- Relax.

00:15:30.721 --> 00:15:32.014
Fuck!

00:15:32.473 --> 00:15:34.391
- Sydney, you okay?
- Yes, I'm all right.

00:15:34.475 --> 00:15:35.976
- Whoa. You all right?
- I'm fine.

00:15:36.060 --> 00:15:37.061
Let me see.

00:15:37.061 --> 00:15:38.354
- Nothing happened.
- You sure?

00:15:38.354 --> 00:15:40.648
I am fine.
Please, let's just close the box cutter.

00:15:40.814 --> 00:15:42.483
Thank you. And not fucking put it there.

00:15:42.483 --> 00:15:44.109
- Excuse me. Behind.
- Relax.

00:15:45.819 --> 00:15:48.030
You two look like
you joined a dumbass cult.

00:15:48.489 --> 00:15:49.949
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

00:15:50.491 --> 00:15:52.576
Stupid fucking aprons.

00:16:22.815 --> 00:16:23.816
Yo.

00:16:23.816 --> 00:16:25.943
Nico, you're dropping shit, man.

00:16:30.239 --> 00:16:31.448
Chef, Ebra, are we good?

00:16:31.532 --> 00:16:33.200
Chef de partie, Chef, coming.

00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:34.827
Looking good. What you got?

00:16:35.202 --> 00:16:37.705
- Family sugara.
- Sugara.

00:16:37.705 --> 00:16:40.040
Great. Chef, you got my sides?

00:16:40.124 --> 00:16:41.709
- Yes, Chef.
- With onions?

00:16:41.709 --> 00:16:43.794
- That's it.
<i>- Si.</i>

00:16:43.794 --> 00:16:45.045
Yo! Shit.

00:16:45.170 --> 00:16:46.880
Shit. Fuck.

00:16:46.964 --> 00:16:48.590
- Sorry. Fuck.
- The stock's boiling.

00:16:48.674 --> 00:16:50.259
Too cloudy. The heat was too high.

00:16:50.259 --> 00:16:51.677
You didn't skim it properly.

00:16:51.677 --> 00:16:54.054
You know better than that.

00:16:54.179 --> 00:16:56.098
- I put it lower earlier.
- It's not low enough.

00:16:56.473 --> 00:16:58.308
- Thanks.
- Thank you, Richie.

00:16:58.809 --> 00:17:01.478
- Fortify it.
- Okay, well, at least it's a jus.

00:17:01.562 --> 00:17:03.188
No.

00:17:03.272 --> 00:17:04.982
You need to strain it, add more onions,

00:17:04.982 --> 00:17:06.608
- add more veal stock, reduce.
- Yes.

00:17:06.692 --> 00:17:08.110
I know how to make a stock.

00:17:08.235 --> 00:17:10.738
Okay. It'll take 30 minutes. Let's go.

00:17:12.531 --> 00:17:13.991
Where are the onions? They prepped?

00:17:14.491 --> 00:17:16.160
- Tina.
- I'm on lemons.

00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:18.495
Tina should be on onions.

00:17:18.579 --> 00:17:20.164
- Yes, Chef.
- I told her earlier...

00:17:20.164 --> 00:17:22.499
Yes, Chef!

00:17:23.292 --> 00:17:25.169
- Yes, Chef.
- Thank you.

00:17:31.050 --> 00:17:32.259
Behind.

00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:08.128
Chefs, walk-through.

00:18:16.011 --> 00:18:18.847
Um, not good. So...

00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:20.891
You betrayed me.

00:18:20.891 --> 00:18:22.101
Are you serious, Chef?

00:18:22.101 --> 00:18:25.062
Come on, clean your station,
and also your nails. Thank you.

00:18:25.771 --> 00:18:29.274
Guys. Can someone please clean
these out? These are disgusting.

00:18:30.692 --> 00:18:32.611
Seriously, please.

00:18:33.862 --> 00:18:37.741
Okay, I'm gonna need bags and napkins
already ready before service.

00:18:37.825 --> 00:18:40.327
Manny and Angel are helping you
with paper cups, plates,

00:18:40.327 --> 00:18:42.037
but that's not really their duty.

00:18:42.121 --> 00:18:43.914
Plus, love the wiping, love that energy.

00:18:43.914 --> 00:18:45.624
Maybe we do it on the floors?

00:18:45.624 --> 00:18:48.043
Because they are so dirty.
I almost broke my neck.

00:18:48.127 --> 00:18:50.671
I think I'm gonna pass out
just looking at them.

00:18:50.671 --> 00:18:51.797
Um, what's up?

00:18:51.797 --> 00:18:53.715
- Yes, Chef.
- Great. Okay.

00:18:56.552 --> 00:18:57.553
It's fine.

00:18:57.553 --> 00:18:58.887
Fine?

00:18:58.971 --> 00:19:00.055
Did I piss you off?

00:19:00.139 --> 00:19:02.432
No. If you are happy
with this, then I am.

00:19:08.147 --> 00:19:09.982
Guys, where's my onions?

00:19:10.732 --> 00:19:12.192
Where are my onions?

00:19:12.442 --> 00:19:14.778
Yeah, that's a really good one.

00:19:14.862 --> 00:19:15.863
I don't know.

00:19:20.534 --> 00:19:21.618
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:19:21.702 --> 00:19:22.953
We should outsource bread.

00:19:22.953 --> 00:19:24.163
- Way ahead of you.
- Okay.

00:19:24.163 --> 00:19:25.330
All right.

00:19:26.081 --> 00:19:28.834
- You didn't take my onions, did you?
- No.

00:19:29.585 --> 00:19:33.088
No. They did this to me last week.
It's just part of paying your dues.

00:19:41.638 --> 00:19:43.265
You are angry right now.

00:19:43.849 --> 00:19:46.268
Damn. We got you.

00:19:46.435 --> 00:19:47.477
They made me do it.

00:19:47.561 --> 00:19:50.230
I swear it wasn't my idea. I swear.

00:19:51.231 --> 00:19:53.275
- Fuck you.
- Hey, come on, Sydney.

00:19:53.525 --> 00:19:54.610
- Fuck off.
- It was just...

00:19:54.735 --> 00:19:56.737
- We was messing around.
- Shut the fuck up.

00:19:56.737 --> 00:19:58.363
- It wasn't my idea.
- Leave me alone.

00:19:58.447 --> 00:19:59.948
Fucking fuck.

00:20:00.032 --> 00:20:02.201
- Let me help you with that.
- No. Don't.

00:20:02.201 --> 00:20:04.119
- Are you sure?
- I am fucking sure.

00:20:04.203 --> 00:20:06.246
Do you ask Carmen if he's sure?

00:20:06.872 --> 00:20:08.916
- It's just heavy.
- No, you don't.

00:20:08.916 --> 00:20:12.544
So you stick to your shit, okay?
I'll stick to mine.

00:20:13.253 --> 00:20:14.379
Yes, Chef.

00:20:53.460 --> 00:20:54.878
Just keep going.

00:21:05.180 --> 00:21:08.058 line:20%
What the hell were you doing, Mike?

00:21:20.737 --> 00:21:23.532
<i>The number
you have reached is not in service.</i>

00:21:28.328 --> 00:21:29.830
Family's up, chefs.

00:21:43.468 --> 00:21:44.678
Fuck.

00:21:52.144 --> 00:21:53.520
- Yo.
- Yo.

00:21:56.773 --> 00:21:59.526
- Family's up.
- Thanks.

00:22:23.842 --> 00:22:25.302
Chef.

00:22:28.013 --> 00:22:29.598
Thank you.

00:22:34.853 --> 00:22:38.357
- It's good.
- No, it looks good, right. Yeah.

00:22:44.112 --> 00:22:45.322
Mind if I chill for a second?

00:22:45.322 --> 00:22:46.907
- Sure. Yeah.
- Yeah.

00:22:55.248 --> 00:22:57.209
How's bookkeeping?

00:22:57.209 --> 00:22:59.211
It's a mess.

00:22:59.211 --> 00:23:01.254
- How's our brigade?
- It's a mess.

00:23:11.056 --> 00:23:12.599
What's going on with you?

00:23:13.141 --> 00:23:14.226
Nothing.

00:23:16.228 --> 00:23:17.687
Sydney.

00:23:19.439 --> 00:23:20.440
Um...

00:23:22.109 --> 00:23:23.652
Yeah, today was

00:23:24.945 --> 00:23:26.905
really bad for me, Chef.

00:23:28.281 --> 00:23:29.366
Okay.

00:23:32.869 --> 00:23:34.496
Can you say more?

00:23:34.496 --> 00:23:36.081
I don't know. Um...

00:23:39.042 --> 00:23:40.627
Chef, you...

00:23:40.627 --> 00:23:44.631
You kind of let everybody
act like trash,

00:23:45.924 --> 00:23:49.719
and really came at me a little, I guess.

00:23:49.803 --> 00:23:51.847
- Uh...
- I expect more from you.

00:23:53.098 --> 00:23:54.850
Hold you to a higher standard.

00:23:55.559 --> 00:23:56.935
Paying my dues.

00:23:58.145 --> 00:24:03.108
Doing your job, which is to,
at times, listen to your boss.

00:24:09.781 --> 00:24:14.202
I think this place could be so different

00:24:14.286 --> 00:24:16.329
from all the other places we've been at.

00:24:18.039 --> 00:24:23.003
But in order for that to be true,
we need to run things different.

00:24:24.754 --> 00:24:27.466
When I said
I didn't think that the brigade

00:24:27.466 --> 00:24:29.593
was a good idea, you didn't listen.

00:24:29.593 --> 00:24:33.847
And it's not
that you told me that I had to.

00:24:33.847 --> 00:24:36.016
That's fine. Whatever.

00:24:36.016 --> 00:24:40.270
But you just didn't really listen.

00:24:40.645 --> 00:24:42.606
And

00:24:43.857 --> 00:24:48.820
if this is going to work the way
that, I think, we both want it to work,

00:24:49.029 --> 00:24:52.824
I think we should probably

00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:56.745
try to listen to each other.

00:24:58.622 --> 00:25:00.749
Yeah. You're right.

00:25:00.749 --> 00:25:05.212
The reason I'm here
and not working somewhere else

00:25:05.212 --> 00:25:07.380
or for someone else

00:25:07.797 --> 00:25:11.468
is 'cause I think I can stand out here.

00:25:11.468 --> 00:25:14.513
I can make a difference here,
we can share ideas.

00:25:14.513 --> 00:25:19.059
I can implement things
that make this place better.

00:25:19.059 --> 00:25:24.105
And I don't want to be wasting my time
working on another line

00:25:24.397 --> 00:25:28.151
or tweezing herbs on a dish
that I don't care about,

00:25:28.235 --> 00:25:30.779
or running brunch, God forbid.

00:25:31.238 --> 00:25:32.697
Yeah.

00:25:33.698 --> 00:25:36.576
And then, you know,

00:25:36.785 --> 00:25:39.996
you kind of left. You did.

00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:42.874
Not even kind of,
you just straight up left.

00:25:43.208 --> 00:25:46.044
- Yeah.
- And that's not really cool.

00:25:46.044 --> 00:25:48.505
- No, it's not.
- After dumping all this stuff on me.

00:25:48.505 --> 00:25:51.466
I know. I know that. Um...

00:25:57.889 --> 00:26:01.851
I went to an Al-Anon meeting.
My brother, he was an addict.

00:26:11.611 --> 00:26:15.865
Chef, that is a little too personal,
I think.

00:26:18.660 --> 00:26:19.661
Oh...

00:26:20.453 --> 00:26:22.539
I'm sorry. I was just fucking with you.

00:26:22.539 --> 00:26:24.124
I'm sorry.

00:26:24.791 --> 00:26:26.001
I'm so sorry.

00:26:26.751 --> 00:26:28.295
- That's all right.

00:26:28.295 --> 00:26:29.921
That's all right.

00:26:33.341 --> 00:26:34.593
I just...

00:26:34.593 --> 00:26:37.429
- I feel like I'm owed one.
- Sure.

00:26:39.097 --> 00:26:41.766
It's not an excuse. I know.

00:26:43.059 --> 00:26:44.477
I know that.

00:26:47.564 --> 00:26:50.275
But now I know that you know, so...

00:26:50.275 --> 00:26:51.943
Good.

00:26:55.071 --> 00:26:56.281
Fucking brunch.

00:26:56.281 --> 00:26:58.450
- Fuck brunch.
- Fuck brunch.

00:27:00.452 --> 00:27:03.872
- We're gonna get rocked tonight.
- Absolutely fucking destroyed, yeah.

00:27:10.211 --> 00:27:12.922
<i>All right, two chickens, three beef.</i>

00:27:13.006 --> 00:27:15.133
<i>One more sausage pepper, one mortadella.</i>

00:27:15.133 --> 00:27:17.802 line:20%
<i>Let's 86 the ravioli, please, chefs.</i>

00:27:17.886 --> 00:27:19.554 line:20%
<i>Two chicken.</i>

00:27:19.638 --> 00:27:22.641
<i>Let me get ten beef all day,
six hot, four sweet. Thank you.</i>

00:27:36.988 --> 00:27:39.449
<i>Hey, it's me again.</i>

00:27:39.449 --> 00:27:41.409
<i>Not sure why you're not calling me back,</i>

00:27:41.743 --> 00:27:44.954
<i>but it's Michael's birthday,</i>

00:27:45.830 --> 00:27:47.707
<i>and I'm thinking about you.</i>
