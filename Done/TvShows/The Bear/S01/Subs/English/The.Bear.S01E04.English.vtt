WEBVTT

00:01:17.827 --> 00:01:19.037
What are you doing there?

00:01:19.037 --> 00:01:20.121
What?

00:01:21.206 --> 00:01:24.042
Why are you trying to put a T-shirt
on a fucking hot dog?

00:01:24.542 --> 00:01:26.377
Kids love hot dogs, dumbass.

00:01:26.461 --> 00:01:29.839
Yeah, I know. That's why we're
making them fucking hot dogs, dumbass.

00:01:29.923 --> 00:01:33.551
Yeah, exactly, cousin. It's a
tie-in. That shit is exposure, baby.

00:01:33.635 --> 00:01:35.095
I don't need you exposing anything.

00:01:35.095 --> 00:01:36.179
Hey...

00:01:36.304 --> 00:01:40.183
It's a fucking hot dog in a Beef
T-shirt. That shit is hilarious.

00:01:40.767 --> 00:01:42.227
Go get me some propane.

00:01:42.227 --> 00:01:45.438
You know what? First of all,
I didn't want to be doing this bullshit.

00:01:45.522 --> 00:01:48.108
All right. You know what?
Then don't borrow money from Cicero

00:01:48.108 --> 00:01:51.402
you can't pay back, then we don't have
to cater little kids' birthday parties.

00:01:51.486 --> 00:01:53.613
- I didn't borrow shit.
- It doesn't even matter.

00:01:53.613 --> 00:01:55.573
It's on me now.
I don't want my legs broken.

00:01:55.657 --> 00:01:57.033
- Shut the fuck up.
- Legs broken?

00:01:57.117 --> 00:02:01.204
If that motherfucker gets close to us,
I'm going to fucking drop his ass.

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:03.081
Okay, look, just help me out.

00:02:03.081 --> 00:02:05.708
- Let's do this right.
- Second of all, you have no idea,

00:02:05.792 --> 00:02:07.585
the amount
of administrative correspondence

00:02:07.669 --> 00:02:09.295
I'm supposed to be doing today.

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:11.589
- Okay? It is fucking bonkers.
- Correspondence?

00:02:11.673 --> 00:02:12.674
- Yeah
- Is that right?

00:02:12.674 --> 00:02:14.342
You like to shit on my system,

00:02:14.342 --> 00:02:17.554
but I run a tight ship
and I get back to my cohorts

00:02:17.554 --> 00:02:20.140
and my associates in a timely fashion.

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.267
Right. Do me a favor
and just name a cohort.

00:02:22.267 --> 00:02:24.227
- Name?
- Name an associate.

00:02:24.227 --> 00:02:26.062
Just one fucking person. I dare you.

00:02:26.146 --> 00:02:29.149
Timothy.
But I'm not fucking... Give me a hand.

00:02:29.149 --> 00:02:31.317
- That's not gonna fit, cousin.
- Yes, it will.

00:02:31.401 --> 00:02:35.113
- It's not gonna fit.
- Can you just help me out?

00:02:35.113 --> 00:02:38.116
- It's not gonna fit.
- It's going to fucking fit.

00:02:40.743 --> 00:02:41.828
You wanna do this shit?

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:43.788
You want some of this?

00:02:46.541 --> 00:02:50.920
Yeah, yeah. Bring your shit.
Fucking baby. You're a fucking baby.

00:02:51.004 --> 00:02:52.755
- You're a fucking baby.
- Morning.

00:02:53.548 --> 00:02:55.300
- Ah! Fuck.

00:03:00.054 --> 00:03:01.055
Look what you did.

00:03:01.973 --> 00:03:02.974
Fucking baby.

00:03:05.768 --> 00:03:08.521
All right. I'm gonna get the spare
from the basement.

00:03:09.522 --> 00:03:11.524
Hey, Marcus, enjoying the counter space?

00:03:11.608 --> 00:03:14.611
Yeah. I mean not having
to do bread anymore is the shit.

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:16.863
Chefs, your prep list is up.

00:03:16.863 --> 00:03:18.573
Please check it out. Thank you.

00:03:19.115 --> 00:03:21.367
Chef. Can you do me a favor
and try this?

00:03:21.451 --> 00:03:22.452
Yeah, sure.

00:03:27.749 --> 00:03:28.750
Wow.

00:03:28.875 --> 00:03:30.835
- Good wow?
- Great wow.

00:03:32.003 --> 00:03:33.004
Thank you, chef.

00:03:37.926 --> 00:03:42.513
Hey, did you remember the mashed
potatoes? Just wanted to check in.

00:03:42.597 --> 00:03:45.308
Do you remember when I said to fuck off?

00:03:45.433 --> 00:03:46.559
Okay. Fuck off isn't yes.

00:03:46.643 --> 00:03:50.230
- Fuck off means I know how to do it.
- All right, well, it's a new recipe.

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:51.439
What did I just say?

00:03:51.439 --> 00:03:54.192
Just make sure when you do it,
the heat isn't too high.

00:03:54.192 --> 00:03:57.487
I answer to Jeff. The system.

00:03:57.904 --> 00:04:01.074
Listen, I'm not trying
to be a tight-ass.

00:04:01.074 --> 00:04:05.578
I don't want you to think
I'm, like, up in your space.

00:04:05.662 --> 00:04:09.791
I'm just doing what I was asked to do
and I get what it's like

00:04:10.333 --> 00:04:13.628
to be a woman in the kitchen and have...

00:04:13.628 --> 00:04:15.838
What it's like
to be a woman in the kitchen?

00:04:15.922 --> 00:04:17.090
Wow. That's amazing.

00:04:17.215 --> 00:04:21.135
Listen, I have been in this kitchen
since before you were born,

00:04:21.219 --> 00:04:23.221
so just back the fuck off.

00:04:24.305 --> 00:04:25.306
Excuse me.

00:04:27.225 --> 00:04:29.269
(ON RADIO) <i>It has not
stopped a grown man</i>

00:04:29.269 --> 00:04:31.229
<i>from stopping his car at the inbound...</i>

00:04:34.941 --> 00:04:38.403
Yo! Oh, my God, cousin,
you've got to see this shit.

00:04:38.403 --> 00:04:40.822
Yo, this dude is trying
to fuck up this little nerd,

00:04:40.822 --> 00:04:44.325
and this fucking nerd
just washes him, bro.

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:46.286
Yo, why the fuck you going to Kennedy?

00:04:46.286 --> 00:04:48.997
Chill the fuck out.
Cicero lives in the neighborhood.

00:04:48.997 --> 00:04:53.418
No. Fucking Cicero's in Wilmette now.

00:04:53.418 --> 00:04:55.461
You got to get on the fucking...

00:04:55.545 --> 00:04:58.631
- That's right. My bad.
- It's all good, though.

00:04:59.173 --> 00:05:00.883
I'm in no hurry
to see that motherfucker.

00:05:01.676 --> 00:05:04.887
I swear to God, cousin, if he calls me
Rick, I'm gonna fucking lose it.

00:05:04.971 --> 00:05:08.641
Cousin, listen, do me a favor, okay?
I'm trying to get us out of this hole.

00:05:08.725 --> 00:05:11.728
All right? I want today to go smooth.
Please don't bring that shit up.

00:05:11.728 --> 00:05:14.897
Chill. I'm not going to bring up shit.
All right?

00:05:14.981 --> 00:05:18.568
- You got it all wrong!
- It's literally the easiest fucking job.

00:05:18.568 --> 00:05:22.530
I'm the only one that stands up to you
and doesn't listen to your bullshit.

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:24.991
- It wasn't my phone.
- Call an electrician or a plumber!

00:05:24.991 --> 00:05:26.409
I've been saying this for years.

00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:28.745
- It wasn't my fucking phone.
-"Cicero, I'm your guy.

00:05:28.745 --> 00:05:31.497
"I got a kid now, Cicero.
I need a fucking real job."

00:05:31.581 --> 00:05:35.835
-"Can I have tickets to <i>Lion King?"</i>
- You don't think I can pick up a phone!

00:05:35.835 --> 00:05:38.963
And we don't even know
how she fell down those stairs.

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:43.509
You want us to get this stuff out back,
or how do you...

00:05:44.344 --> 00:05:45.345
Yeah.

00:05:45.345 --> 00:05:47.805
- Take it around the side, will you?
- The side? Sure.

00:05:47.889 --> 00:05:49.057
Yeah. Thanks, Rick.

00:05:49.474 --> 00:05:51.225
I fucking hate when you call me Rick.

00:05:51.309 --> 00:05:53.686
I fucking hate
when you don't answer your phone.

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:55.521
Food's here, kiddies.

00:05:57.148 --> 00:05:59.567
That was nice.
Thank you for that. That was good.

00:06:07.492 --> 00:06:09.327
Carmen, is that you?

00:06:09.327 --> 00:06:11.954
Hey. Mr. Zurski. How are you?

00:06:12.038 --> 00:06:13.831
I thought you had killed yourself.

00:06:14.123 --> 00:06:16.709
No, sir, that was my brother.

00:06:22.924 --> 00:06:24.092
Bullshit.

00:06:24.592 --> 00:06:27.178
That motherfucker
is complete fucking bullshit.

00:06:27.178 --> 00:06:28.304
Hey, perfect timing.

00:06:28.388 --> 00:06:30.306
- Who does he think he is?
- I did everything.

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:32.517
You know he's not even Italian, right?
100% Polish.

00:06:32.517 --> 00:06:35.228
- Fucking insulting.
- You're not even Italian, right?

00:06:35.228 --> 00:06:36.938
I'm more Italian than that guy is.

00:06:36.938 --> 00:06:38.940
Turn on the grill.
I gotta get the dogs going.

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:41.734
Just give me a second here.

00:06:41.818 --> 00:06:45.655
- Richie, what the fuck is that?
- Relax, shit's regulated.

00:06:46.197 --> 00:06:49.617
I suffer from anxiety and dread.

00:06:49.617 --> 00:06:51.452
- Who doesn't.
- You want half?

00:06:51.911 --> 00:06:53.037
No.

00:06:53.538 --> 00:06:56.290
- Which box did you put the ketchup in?
- Hmm?

00:06:56.707 --> 00:06:59.293
- The ketchup. Which box?
- I didn't bring ketchup.

00:07:00.044 --> 00:07:01.504
Why didn't you bring ketchup?

00:07:02.171 --> 00:07:06.175
What kind of asshole
is going to put ketchup on a hot dog?

00:07:06.509 --> 00:07:09.762
- A child, Richie.
- A child asshole.

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:12.390
You're a child, asshole.

00:07:13.266 --> 00:07:15.935
Yo, yo, cousin, what's up
with all this gay-ass fruit?

00:07:16.394 --> 00:07:20.398
- Homemade Ecto Cooler, motherfucker.
- Oh... Shit!

00:07:21.941 --> 00:07:23.568
It's actually pretty fucking dope.

00:07:26.112 --> 00:07:27.488
Rest in peace, Harold.

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:35.079
One bite of a doughnut
brings you much joy.

00:07:36.372 --> 00:07:37.957
Two bites just brings sadness.

00:07:39.625 --> 00:07:42.503
I mean, nobody doesn't love
that first bite of a doughnut.

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:45.047
It used to be my favorite
when I was a kid.

00:07:46.382 --> 00:07:49.594
- Sweet tooth?
- Yeah, but not even the taste.

00:07:49.594 --> 00:07:52.972
I just loved looking at them.
The colors and textures.

00:07:52.972 --> 00:07:55.224
There was this one doughnut
that I used to love

00:07:55.308 --> 00:07:56.976
that I could never get out of my head.

00:07:56.976 --> 00:08:00.688
Jelly-filled, bright purple,
sweet and tangy.

00:08:01.272 --> 00:08:03.858
Yeah. Family was always happy
whenever we got doughnuts.

00:08:03.858 --> 00:08:06.319
- Hard not to be, young man.
- Yeah.

00:08:06.319 --> 00:08:08.738
- My guys.
- Wow. Chester. Yes.

00:08:08.738 --> 00:08:09.947
Wow. Thank you.

00:08:10.031 --> 00:08:11.949
- Love you.
- Of course, bro.

00:08:12.033 --> 00:08:13.409
Yes. Ebra.

00:08:13.493 --> 00:08:14.994
- Chester.
- Hi, honey.

00:08:14.994 --> 00:08:17.371
- What up, T? What you got over there?
- Mashed potatoes.

00:08:17.455 --> 00:08:18.456
Woo-hoo!

00:08:18.456 --> 00:08:19.540
Wish I had that.

00:08:19.624 --> 00:08:23.002
Oh, uh...
New edition, all the fresh colors.

00:08:23.002 --> 00:08:26.088
I put a flag on 18-32-24.

00:08:26.172 --> 00:08:28.883
It's this radiant orchid
that's fly as fuck.

00:08:28.883 --> 00:08:30.134
Hey, thank you so much.

00:08:30.218 --> 00:08:31.928
- I'mma get this back to you.
- Ebraheim,

00:08:31.928 --> 00:08:34.430
- what is good with the beef?
- Oh, yes, chef.

00:08:35.139 --> 00:08:36.807
- Taking it out now.
- Thank you.

00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:39.894
- What's up? Hey.
- Hey.

00:08:40.645 --> 00:08:44.232
- Who are you? Sorry.
- Sorry. Chester, this is Chef Sydney.

00:08:44.232 --> 00:08:46.025
Sydney, this is my roommate, Chester.

00:08:46.025 --> 00:08:48.444
Hi, Chester Roommate.

00:08:48.528 --> 00:08:50.196
Hey, Chef Sydney.

00:08:52.323 --> 00:08:55.952
- Cool. Why are you here? Sorry.
- Oh. Getting my boy dialed.

00:08:55.952 --> 00:08:57.954
Dropping off some
inspirational materials.

00:08:57.954 --> 00:08:59.497
- He's a designer.
- Oh!

00:09:01.207 --> 00:09:03.000
- What do you design?
- All of it.

00:09:05.586 --> 00:09:07.922
- I'm out. I'll see you at home, my G.
- Yeah, yeah.

00:09:07.922 --> 00:09:09.715
- Thank you. I'll return this.
- Of course.

00:09:09.799 --> 00:09:11.592
- Great to meet you, Chef Sydney.
- You too.

00:09:11.676 --> 00:09:13.177
- Good luck with the meeting.
- Thanks.

00:09:13.261 --> 00:09:14.512
I'm meetin' a brand ambassador

00:09:14.512 --> 00:09:16.806
so I can't be smellin
' like fuckin' hot giardiniera.

00:09:16.806 --> 00:09:17.932
All right, I'm out.

00:09:20.685 --> 00:09:22.853
Oh. Pantone colors?

00:09:22.937 --> 00:09:26.315
I was thinking maybe I could do
a classic doughnut for the Beef?

00:09:26.399 --> 00:09:28.317
On top of my other stuff, of course.

00:09:28.401 --> 00:09:30.444
- Yeah.
- But I think it could be hot.

00:09:30.528 --> 00:09:33.573
Yeah. I mean,
doughnuts are deceptively hard,

00:09:34.115 --> 00:09:37.326
but, you know,
require a lot of equipment too.

00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:40.496
I don't know if this is the most
stocked place in the world.

00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:43.583
I want it to be perfect, like that plum.

00:09:43.583 --> 00:09:46.836
- The one Carmen was telling us about.
- Mmm. Michelin mode?

00:09:46.836 --> 00:09:48.170
Yeah. I mean, I don't know.

00:09:48.254 --> 00:09:50.673
It could be, like,
limited edition or something.

00:09:51.007 --> 00:09:53.342
If you're into it, then I'm into it.

00:09:53.801 --> 00:09:55.428
Let me know if you need help.
All right?

00:09:55.428 --> 00:09:57.263
All right. Gladly. Thank you, chef.

00:09:58.556 --> 00:09:59.974
- Good luck.
- All right.

00:10:02.602 --> 00:10:03.728
Hey, all good?

00:10:04.270 --> 00:10:06.564
All good, chef.

00:10:06.564 --> 00:10:10.568
Cool. Sweeps is rockin' family.
Angel, how do you feel about salad?

00:10:10.568 --> 00:10:12.903
- Absolutely, chef.
- Gorgeous. Thank you.

00:10:12.987 --> 00:10:16.032
- You think I can get family today?
- No, you don't work here.

00:10:20.286 --> 00:10:21.621
Hey, chef, how's it going?

00:10:22.455 --> 00:10:24.540
- Good, chef.
- Try the new chocolate cake?

00:10:24.624 --> 00:10:26.542
- Oh, yes.
- And?

00:10:26.626 --> 00:10:28.502
You give Marcus a lot of confidence.

00:10:29.295 --> 00:10:30.296
Well done.

00:11:08.376 --> 00:11:11.253
You didn't make any of these?
Or are these the ones you made?

00:11:11.337 --> 00:11:12.380
I haven't made any yet.

00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:13.839
I'm trying to do some research,

00:11:13.923 --> 00:11:17.510
you know, feel out the textures,
see what it's really about.

00:11:18.135 --> 00:11:20.554
That's a nice...
Do you talk about feel?

00:11:20.638 --> 00:11:23.307
Yeah, see, this one is good.
Just like...

00:11:23.391 --> 00:11:25.142
- That one's good?
- Yeah, I think so.

00:11:25.226 --> 00:11:26.352
That's nice.

00:11:26.352 --> 00:11:29.021
It's how when you go to
your grandma's house,

00:11:29.105 --> 00:11:31.190
she has the cushion
on top of the toilet seat.

00:11:31.190 --> 00:11:32.274
- Yeah.
- You sit on it.

00:11:32.358 --> 00:11:34.777
- Slight deflating.
- And it smells like potpourri.

00:11:34.777 --> 00:11:36.445
But it also smells like Grandma.

00:11:47.915 --> 00:11:51.460
- Hey, what's up, jagoff?
- Hey! What's going on? Good to see you.

00:11:51.544 --> 00:11:54.296
- New York, that's right.
- Hi.

00:11:56.298 --> 00:11:57.675
I haven't seen that one.

00:11:58.175 --> 00:11:59.844
Mr. New York!

00:12:00.594 --> 00:12:01.679
How are you?

00:12:01.679 --> 00:12:02.763
You look slimmer.

00:12:02.847 --> 00:12:04.432
- I'm sorry about Michael.
- Thank you.

00:12:04.557 --> 00:12:06.475
No, no, no.

00:12:07.601 --> 00:12:09.145
Ketchup?

00:12:09.145 --> 00:12:11.063
Can you not see this?
This is bullshit!

00:12:11.147 --> 00:12:12.732
I can't hear you when you're screaming!

00:12:12.732 --> 00:12:14.358
You see them opening all my presents?

00:12:14.442 --> 00:12:15.443
Bullshit!

00:12:15.443 --> 00:12:16.527
You guys are so weird!

00:12:16.527 --> 00:12:18.738
What are you doing
opening up other people's stuff?

00:12:18.738 --> 00:12:22.116
Carol, can you please help me?
It really fucking sucks in here.

00:12:22.116 --> 00:12:23.826
Here. Hey, I got one...

00:12:23.826 --> 00:12:27.037
I got one question for you.
So you work in a restaurant, right?

00:12:27.121 --> 00:12:28.914
I work in a restaurant,
that's right.

00:12:28.998 --> 00:12:31.584
What is it like to be
a fucking loser, huh?

00:12:31.751 --> 00:12:33.294
Good, Frank.

00:12:33.294 --> 00:12:34.879
Hey, guys, Guys!

00:12:34.879 --> 00:12:37.673
Hey. Carmen here

00:12:37.757 --> 00:12:40.509
was the chef
of the best restaurant in the world.

00:12:40.593 --> 00:12:42.386
Okay, that's not an exaggeration.

00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:45.306
It's literally the best restaurant
in the world.

00:12:45.890 --> 00:12:48.267
I mean, at least according to <i>Eater.</i>

00:13:09.997 --> 00:13:11.916
I didn't come out to talk to you,
all right?

00:13:11.916 --> 00:13:13.876
I don't want to bicker.
I just need quiet.

00:13:14.502 --> 00:13:15.961
I don't got anything to say to you.

00:13:17.755 --> 00:13:21.175
Except heads-up. Pete's here.

00:13:21.175 --> 00:13:25.012
- Oh, I'm aware.
- Sugar better watch his ass.

00:13:25.012 --> 00:13:26.931
Sugar's stuck at work.

00:13:27.306 --> 00:13:29.725
Fucker drops off a gift
and now he won't leave.

00:13:29.809 --> 00:13:32.520
Oh, my God. Yeesh.

00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:33.729
Yeesh is right.

00:13:34.021 --> 00:13:37.233
Always looks like he's
about to call the cops on us.

00:13:37.233 --> 00:13:38.442
You know what I mean?

00:13:38.567 --> 00:13:40.277
- Like a narc.
- Exactly.

00:13:41.028 --> 00:13:42.488
Like a fucking narc.

00:13:45.157 --> 00:13:46.951
- Heya, Phil.
- Hey, Jimmy.

00:13:49.662 --> 00:13:50.788
Richard.

00:13:50.788 --> 00:13:52.540
Hey, what's up, Phil?

00:13:59.338 --> 00:14:00.798
That was fucking weird.

00:14:02.258 --> 00:14:04.760
What. You fuck up one of
his properties too?

00:14:04.844 --> 00:14:05.845
Actually, no.

00:14:05.845 --> 00:14:08.472
'Cause you know what, Jimmy?
I don't fuck up properties.

00:14:08.556 --> 00:14:11.976
You know, sometimes people think
they're calling me to fix the toilet,

00:14:11.976 --> 00:14:14.061
but in reality,
they called somebody else.

00:14:14.061 --> 00:14:15.980
All you had to do is pick up the phone.

00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:17.690
I never got a fucking call.

00:14:17.690 --> 00:14:19.108
Oh, yeah, really?

00:14:19.817 --> 00:14:21.068
Fuck this.

00:14:22.069 --> 00:14:23.863
All right, so here's what she said.

00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:29.201
"Couldn't turn off the sink.
There's water leaking everywhere.

00:14:29.451 --> 00:14:31.787
-"I couldn't find anyone."
- Freaking malarkey.

00:14:31.871 --> 00:14:33.873
"I repeatedly called Rick

00:14:33.873 --> 00:14:37.793
"at 847-555-0186."

00:14:38.419 --> 00:14:39.962
Number sound familiar, Ricky?

00:14:40.337 --> 00:14:43.465
Yeah, because that's Michael's number.

00:14:46.135 --> 00:14:49.305
Nobody looks at fucking digits anymore.
I'm 312, dog.

00:14:55.561 --> 00:14:56.645
That kid, man.

00:14:59.315 --> 00:15:00.357
That kid.

00:15:20.961 --> 00:15:22.421
- Hey, chef.
- What?

00:15:22.421 --> 00:15:25.299
Could you please use a salt bed
next time like I asked?

00:15:26.342 --> 00:15:29.428
- Why are you always watching me?
-'Cause it's just sort of my job.

00:15:29.428 --> 00:15:32.348
Also maybe we don't use,

00:15:32.348 --> 00:15:35.100
like, gross kitchen towels.

00:15:35.976 --> 00:15:38.228
- Judgmental.
- Just use a knife.

00:15:38.312 --> 00:15:39.939
I don't think it's judgement,

00:15:39.939 --> 00:15:42.775
I think it's just like health
and safety, generally.

00:15:43.275 --> 00:15:46.153
- Cool. So.
- God damnit. Okay. I got it.

00:15:46.153 --> 00:15:48.656
- I'm just trying to help.
- Yeah, thanks. I got it.

00:15:48.656 --> 00:15:49.740
- Thank you.
- Got it.

00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:51.533
- Thank you, chef.
- Got it.

00:16:29.989 --> 00:16:32.116
Both of these fucking ninny boys.

00:16:32.116 --> 00:16:33.951
They called ambulances, right?

00:16:33.951 --> 00:16:37.121
They're both in ambulances,
on the way to the hospital.

00:16:37.121 --> 00:16:39.456
And then, what did
the medical professionals,

00:16:39.540 --> 00:16:41.417
whose time you were wasting, say to you?

00:16:41.417 --> 00:16:44.503
He goes, "What the hell did you
do that for?"

00:16:45.546 --> 00:16:46.672
What the fuck do you think

00:16:46.672 --> 00:16:50.551
that their shit wasn't spicy,
like, why would they lie about that?

00:16:52.845 --> 00:16:53.846
What's up, dudes?

00:16:54.179 --> 00:16:55.848
- Yeah
- What's up, man?

00:16:57.641 --> 00:16:59.893
You guys just
laughing it up over here?

00:16:59.977 --> 00:17:00.978
Nope.

00:17:03.147 --> 00:17:04.231
Hey, what's in the cooler?

00:17:04.732 --> 00:17:05.774
Made, Ecto-Cooler.

00:17:05.858 --> 00:17:07.860
No way, like <i>Ghostbusters?</i>

00:17:07.860 --> 00:17:10.112
- Yeah.

00:17:12.698 --> 00:17:14.283
Looks like it needs a refill.

00:17:14.283 --> 00:17:15.492
Yeah. Yeah, I'm on it.

00:17:18.203 --> 00:17:20.414
Damn, man. Fun birthday party. Huh?

00:17:24.334 --> 00:17:25.419
Whoa! No way.

00:17:25.419 --> 00:17:27.004
This is, like, identical, dude.

00:17:27.296 --> 00:17:28.881
Good. Thank you.

00:17:28.881 --> 00:17:31.717
<i>Busting makes me feel good</i>

00:17:31.717 --> 00:17:32.801
From the song.

00:17:33.594 --> 00:17:34.595
No, I remember.

00:17:34.595 --> 00:17:35.721
Yeah.

00:17:37.056 --> 00:17:38.807
What's it, like, nap time or something?

00:17:39.266 --> 00:17:40.267
Huh?

00:17:44.855 --> 00:17:46.732
- That's weird.
- Huh.

00:17:47.983 --> 00:17:50.152
- Richie. How you been, man?
- I got to...

00:17:51.945 --> 00:17:53.155
Cool, cool, cool.

00:17:57.534 --> 00:17:59.161
Wow, man. This is so good, dude.

00:17:59.620 --> 00:18:00.913
- Good. Good.
- Killed it.

00:18:00.913 --> 00:18:01.997
Thanks man.

00:18:03.248 --> 00:18:06.668
Hey, I know that, you know, sometimes
things are weird or whatever with...

00:18:06.752 --> 00:18:09.129
- Oh, we don't have to do that.
- Okay, but I'm,

00:18:09.213 --> 00:18:12.299
- you know, I'm a bit of a foodie.
- Jesus Christ, Pete.

00:18:12.299 --> 00:18:15.427
Well, all right. I know
that's not cool or whatever,

00:18:15.511 --> 00:18:17.971
you know, I did just want to say
that I followed

00:18:18.055 --> 00:18:20.349
everything you were up to
out there, man and...

00:18:21.100 --> 00:18:25.354
Just... I know how much courage
that took for you, so.

00:18:26.438 --> 00:18:30.150
And I just was pumped for you. You know?

00:18:32.402 --> 00:18:34.613
I bet probably
a lot of people don't realize,

00:18:34.613 --> 00:18:38.325
like, how much work that must've took
and dedication or whatever.

00:18:38.325 --> 00:18:41.245
And so just...
So I thought it was cool, man.

00:18:42.996 --> 00:18:45.999
And your sister,
frickin' was really pumped for you.

00:18:46.083 --> 00:18:47.209
Really, really pumped.

00:18:47.709 --> 00:18:51.839
Yeah, but she also, you know,
really missed you a lot, too.

00:18:53.757 --> 00:18:56.009
- Thank you. Thank you, Pete.
- Yeah, man.

00:18:58.554 --> 00:19:00.305
Feeling tired all of a sudden.

00:19:00.389 --> 00:19:02.850
So, she's not really busy at work, huh?

00:19:02.850 --> 00:19:05.185
Oh, no, she's pissed at you.

00:19:07.354 --> 00:19:10.232
- Yeah, I owe her a call.
- Or, you know, like, 50 calls.

00:19:11.150 --> 00:19:13.986
I don't want to get
in the middle of anything or whatever,

00:19:13.986 --> 00:19:16.655
but, I mean, it was hard for her too,
you know?

00:19:17.906 --> 00:19:19.950
Look. I got to keep jamming here,
all right?

00:19:19.950 --> 00:19:22.161
Yeah, I know, totally.
I'm going to head in,

00:19:22.161 --> 00:19:23.871
but I'll catch you before you cruise?

00:19:23.871 --> 00:19:25.831
- Yes.
- Yeah. Cool. Cool.

00:19:27.916 --> 00:19:30.419
This freaking guy? Hilarious.

00:19:39.553 --> 00:19:40.846
Fuck.

00:19:42.764 --> 00:19:44.099
Fuck. Shit.

00:19:44.975 --> 00:19:47.436
Got a little more ketchup here.

00:19:47.561 --> 00:19:48.562
Thanks.

00:19:49.563 --> 00:19:50.564
Um...

00:19:51.773 --> 00:19:52.774
What?

00:19:54.526 --> 00:19:55.527
Don't kill me.

00:19:56.445 --> 00:19:57.779
Oh, I can't wait for this.

00:19:58.655 --> 00:20:03.160
We, uh... We spilled a bottle
of Xanax in the cooler.

00:20:13.170 --> 00:20:14.588
What, are they fucking dead?

00:20:15.839 --> 00:20:19.718
No, no, no.
I think they're just sleeping?

00:20:23.555 --> 00:20:25.057
Actually, I'm kind of into it.

00:20:26.934 --> 00:20:28.936
- Yeah?
- Oh, yeah.

00:20:31.146 --> 00:20:33.023
Keep up the good work.
You're killing it.

00:20:33.023 --> 00:20:34.233
All right.

00:20:36.944 --> 00:20:37.986
Fuck.

00:20:39.154 --> 00:20:41.740
Okay, chefs.
Let's get ready to taste the potatoes.

00:20:48.372 --> 00:20:49.706
Fuck.

00:20:57.005 --> 00:20:58.882
Oh, come on. Come on, come on!

00:21:08.684 --> 00:21:09.685
Behind!

00:21:10.727 --> 00:21:12.396
- Whoa.
- Come on...

00:21:12.396 --> 00:21:14.898
Fuck. Sorry, sorry.

00:21:14.982 --> 00:21:16.233
- Sorry.
- It's cool.

00:21:16.233 --> 00:21:17.693
Fuck! Come on, Tina.

00:21:19.903 --> 00:21:21.113
Sorry.

00:21:22.322 --> 00:21:23.615
Fuck.

00:21:31.456 --> 00:21:32.499
Why did you do this?

00:21:33.208 --> 00:21:35.294
Because I don't have time
to fuck around.

00:21:35.711 --> 00:21:36.920
You're welcome, chef.

00:21:53.228 --> 00:21:54.229
Damn.

00:21:55.105 --> 00:21:58.025
- Coffee?
- No, no, I'm good.

00:22:02.779 --> 00:22:03.780
When is that from?

00:22:05.032 --> 00:22:06.950
Repeat party. Grant Park, '92.

00:22:09.953 --> 00:22:10.954
You ever miss him?

00:22:11.913 --> 00:22:13.957
Didn't really know him
well enough to miss him.

00:22:15.334 --> 00:22:16.501
You?

00:22:17.044 --> 00:22:20.213
Sometimes. You know,
we were so close in age,

00:22:20.297 --> 00:22:22.799
more like...
More like a friend than family.

00:22:22.883 --> 00:22:25.427
You know, we were...
Same kind of problems

00:22:25.427 --> 00:22:28.472
around the same time.
We had a lot to talk about.

00:22:30.390 --> 00:22:31.391
That sounds nice.

00:22:34.978 --> 00:22:35.979
It was.

00:22:38.607 --> 00:22:40.317
When's the last time you talked to him?

00:22:43.153 --> 00:22:46.573
Around 20 years ago.
We had a gnarly fight, man.

00:22:47.783 --> 00:22:48.909
What was it about?

00:22:49.534 --> 00:22:50.535
Million things.

00:22:51.787 --> 00:22:53.580
You know, drugs, alcohol, gambling,

00:22:53.580 --> 00:22:57.376
mostly 'cause he just insisted on doing
stupid fucking shit all the time.

00:22:58.835 --> 00:23:00.504
He'd had a new career,

00:23:01.046 --> 00:23:02.381
like, every ten minutes.

00:23:03.673 --> 00:23:07.677
Wanted to be a broker, and then he
wanted to be a defensive coordinator.

00:23:07.761 --> 00:23:08.762
I'm dead serious.

00:23:09.596 --> 00:23:14.267
And then some asshole
invests in Ed Debevics.

00:23:14.351 --> 00:23:16.561
And, you know,
suddenly he's a restauranteur.

00:23:18.855 --> 00:23:19.856
Sounds about right.

00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:21.566
Yeah.

00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:24.444
Really stuck your poor mom
with that place. Man.

00:23:25.570 --> 00:23:29.074
I mean, don't you find it impossible
being in there 24 hours a day?

00:23:29.074 --> 00:23:32.744
I'm in there for five minutes
and I start thinking about bad shit.

00:23:33.203 --> 00:23:35.622
- That's probably why I like it so much.
- Yeah.

00:23:35.622 --> 00:23:37.499
Probably why you want to fix it, too.

00:23:39.376 --> 00:23:40.377
Probably.

00:23:41.002 --> 00:23:45.006
Just, you know...
Just don't be too disappointed

00:23:45.090 --> 00:23:47.217
if it doesn't necessarily happen.

00:23:47.801 --> 00:23:48.802
All right.

00:23:49.261 --> 00:23:51.721
You know I'm not going
to sell it to you, right?

00:23:51.805 --> 00:23:52.973
I know that.

00:23:55.934 --> 00:23:57.060
I had a dream about him.

00:23:57.144 --> 00:24:00.981
Once, your dad, we were up in, um,

00:24:02.232 --> 00:24:07.154
Lake Geneva, or someplace,
and we're going along.

00:24:07.154 --> 00:24:09.531
We're driving along this car, big SUV.

00:24:10.115 --> 00:24:13.618
He's in the passenger seat and
we're driving fast, like, really fast.

00:24:14.578 --> 00:24:16.246
And I can't get control.

00:24:17.080 --> 00:24:20.041
You know, it's like bumpy car's
flying all over the place.

00:24:20.125 --> 00:24:21.460
He wouldn't put on a seat belt.

00:24:23.420 --> 00:24:26.298
Suddenly this little kid, a little boy,

00:24:26.298 --> 00:24:30.051
he walks out in the middle of the road,
I jam on the brakes really hard.

00:24:31.052 --> 00:24:32.929
Car stops like a millimeter
away from him.

00:24:34.806 --> 00:24:38.185
But your dad,
he goes flying through the windshield,

00:24:39.394 --> 00:24:40.437
but he never lands.

00:24:42.481 --> 00:24:43.732
Well, he keeps on flying.

00:24:49.529 --> 00:24:50.780
What happened to the kid?

00:24:52.574 --> 00:24:54.034
He stood there waving at him.

00:25:01.791 --> 00:25:03.752
Well, on a on a sunnier note,

00:25:03.752 --> 00:25:08.715
you have, you have knocked
two K off your tab. Congrats.

00:25:08.715 --> 00:25:10.258
Nice segue.

00:25:11.718 --> 00:25:12.844
I'm a segue king.

00:25:13.929 --> 00:25:15.931
So what do we owe you now? $298,000?

00:25:15.931 --> 00:25:18.141
$298,050.

00:25:18.975 --> 00:25:21.561
- What's that 50 about?
- Shipping and handling.

00:25:23.063 --> 00:25:24.105
Asshole.

00:25:30.278 --> 00:25:32.739
Come on...

00:25:32.739 --> 00:25:34.950
Chef, can I taste
the new potatoes?

00:25:35.367 --> 00:25:36.368
One minute.

00:26:06.648 --> 00:26:09.067
- Go ahead, get it over with.
- Get what over with?

00:26:09.067 --> 00:26:11.403
Taste it and tell me it's shitty.

00:26:14.906 --> 00:26:16.408
- It's great. Thanks, chef.
- What?

00:26:17.993 --> 00:26:20.287
It's great. Thank you, chef.

00:26:20.787 --> 00:26:23.707
Now, let's hurry up
and roll before we get rolled, yeah?

00:26:42.767 --> 00:26:44.185
Thank you, Jeff.

00:26:44.561 --> 00:26:46.104
Chef.

00:27:08.209 --> 00:27:10.128
All right.
Let's get the hell out of here.

00:27:10.128 --> 00:27:11.796
I didn't get a chance to eat anything.

00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:14.674
- Me neither. I'm fucking starving.
- Hey. Nice work today, fellas.

00:27:14.758 --> 00:27:16.760
- Seriously.
- Good to see you, Uncle Jim.

00:27:16.760 --> 00:27:18.094
- Love you, Bear.
- Love you.

00:27:23.516 --> 00:27:26.394
- Later, Richard.
- All right. Until next time, James.

00:27:27.062 --> 00:27:29.773
Hey, you guys want to see
something disgusting?

00:27:32.067 --> 00:27:34.527
I don't understand it.
It's so mysterious to me.

00:27:34.611 --> 00:27:37.238
He's sitting there
just sleeping like a baby.

00:27:37.322 --> 00:27:39.449
I want to beat the living,
fucking crap out of him.

00:27:39.449 --> 00:27:40.617
- You know?
- Exactly.

00:27:46.373 --> 00:27:48.541
Thank you for making me
part of this family.

00:27:52.671 --> 00:27:54.255
I'll never forget these memories.

00:27:54.798 --> 00:27:57.342
Shut the fuck up, you fucking nerd.

00:27:57.717 --> 00:27:58.760
Sleep there.

00:28:00.845 --> 00:28:02.681
- Are we almost back?
- Yeah.

00:28:10.105 --> 00:28:11.231
Sorry, man.

00:28:38.675 --> 00:28:40.510
Yo, yo,
got some family dessert.

00:28:41.720 --> 00:28:42.887
That looks nice.

00:28:51.813 --> 00:28:54.065
We all get cake
because we're best friends.

00:28:54.983 --> 00:28:56.317
Thank you.

00:28:57.026 --> 00:28:58.153
Hey.

00:28:58.987 --> 00:28:59.988
Chef.
