WEBVTT

00:00:05.005 --> 00:00:06.298
(Dramatic music playing)

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:10.802
I'm Randall park
at freedom high school,

00:00:10.886 --> 00:00:12.888
continuing our
all-access coverage

00:00:12.971 --> 00:00:15.224
of the Dwayne Johnson
presidential campaign.

00:00:15.307 --> 00:00:17.184
(Camera shutters clicking)

00:00:17.267 --> 00:00:20.729
Thank you for joining us
for the official opening

00:00:20.812 --> 00:00:24.107
of the Dwayne Johnson library.

00:00:24.191 --> 00:00:26.318
Dwayne, we always knew

00:00:26.401 --> 00:00:28.904
that you were destined
for greatness.

00:00:28.987 --> 00:00:29.988
Adult Dwayne: Nice lady.

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:32.616
She made me sound good,
but none of it was true.

00:00:32.699 --> 00:00:35.428
I mean, the only thing that people
said I was destined to do was time.

00:00:35.452 --> 00:00:37.496
(Both chuckle) That's good.

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:39.373
As we all know,
nobody's perfect,

00:00:39.456 --> 00:00:40.707
and we all screw up.

00:00:40.791 --> 00:00:43.043
I just happened to screw up
a little bit more than most.

00:00:43.126 --> 00:00:44.979
As a matter of fact, Randall,
when I first got here

00:00:45.003 --> 00:00:47.381
to freedom high school,
I was a hardcore shoplifter.

00:00:47.464 --> 00:00:48.465
Mmm-hmm.

00:00:49.341 --> 00:00:50.676
Hey, just so you know,

00:00:50.759 --> 00:00:52.094
you guys have to come in tighter

00:00:52.177 --> 00:00:53.337
when he says stuff like that.

00:00:53.387 --> 00:00:54.638
Well, it's too late now.

00:00:54.721 --> 00:00:55.722
It's too late. Back up.

00:00:56.723 --> 00:00:57.724
Just anticipate.

00:00:58.934 --> 00:00:59.935
Uh, confinue.

00:01:00.018 --> 00:01:03.188
Yeah, so we moved here
to Bethlehem from Nashville

00:01:03.272 --> 00:01:05.500
because my dad wasn't wrestling
for Vince McMahon anymore.

00:01:05.524 --> 00:01:06.775
That's your father... mmm-hmm.

00:01:06.858 --> 00:01:11.029
(Mimics wrestling announcer)
"Soul man" rocky Johnson!

00:01:11.113 --> 00:01:12.823
Nice, man. Good job.

00:01:12.906 --> 00:01:14.241
Give me some. All right.

00:01:14.324 --> 00:01:15.867
I did. You practiced
that, didn't you?

00:01:16.785 --> 00:01:19.955
I don't know if I mentioned
it, but I used to be an actor.

00:01:20.038 --> 00:01:21.498
You have. I have? Okay.

00:01:21.582 --> 00:01:23.250
Yeah, yeah, multiple
times. Oh, okay.

00:01:23.417 --> 00:01:24.960
But back to my parents.
Yes, yes.

00:01:25.043 --> 00:01:26.729
So, money wasn't coming in
the way it used to,

00:01:26.753 --> 00:01:29.131
so he and my mom opened up
a cleaning business.

00:01:29.339 --> 00:01:32.426
I had a side job
after school slinging pizza,

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:34.320
but the only thing I wanted to
do was chase girls.

00:01:34.344 --> 00:01:35.554
(Chuckles)

00:01:35.637 --> 00:01:37.139
And to get their attention,
I thought

00:01:37.222 --> 00:01:40.142
that I had to look rich,
hence all the stealing.

00:01:40.225 --> 00:01:41.505
Sandy: Candidate Johnson,
please,

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.437
remember
our media training session.

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.690
It's fine, Sandy.
Yeah, it's fine, Sandy.

00:01:47.357 --> 00:01:49.109
So my dad was still
trying to wrestle

00:01:49.192 --> 00:01:51.320
any chance that he got,
so my uncle of a

00:01:51.403 --> 00:01:53.530
from the wild Samoans...
The wild Samoans.

00:01:53.614 --> 00:01:56.033
(Growls) Yeah, that's good.

00:01:56.116 --> 00:01:57.451
Yeah. Borderline inappropriate.

00:01:57.534 --> 00:01:58.595
Oh, okay. It was the tongue.

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.245
Yeah. Oh, sorry. Yeah.

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:01.997
So my uncle of a hooked my dad up

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:03.999
with a promoter
who got him booked

00:02:04.082 --> 00:02:06.168
on some local shows,
which was great.

00:02:06.251 --> 00:02:08.879
I mean, we needed the money,
but my dad

00:02:08.962 --> 00:02:10.797
was still very much reliving

00:02:10.881 --> 00:02:12.883
his glory days
of the early '80s.

00:02:13.175 --> 00:02:15.010
Announcer: Listen to that crowd!

00:02:15.093 --> 00:02:16.303
Whoo!

00:02:16.386 --> 00:02:18.746
Announcer: Kick to the
midsection. Johnson taking a beating!

00:02:19.723 --> 00:02:21.808
Rocky making
an incredible comeback

00:02:21.892 --> 00:02:23.477
against the nature boy.

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:24.728
(Cheers and applause)

00:02:24.978 --> 00:02:27.147
Here comes the big soul man.
Right hand!

00:02:27.439 --> 00:02:28.899
(Soul man playing)

00:02:29.191 --> 00:02:31.526
(Crowd cheering)

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:33.070
He holds flair up!

00:02:33.153 --> 00:02:34.529
(Crowd cheering) One, two...

00:02:34.613 --> 00:02:36.448
Three, and the crowd goes wild!

00:02:36.531 --> 00:02:37.866
Damn right, they did!

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:39.576
I remember seeing
that match on TV.

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.079
Flair's a great guy.
Just don't touch his hair.

00:02:42.621 --> 00:02:45.957
But do compliment
his ring entrance robe.

00:02:46.041 --> 00:02:48.001
Brother spends a ton
on feathering.

00:02:52.172 --> 00:02:53.507
(Sighs)

00:02:56.093 --> 00:02:57.803
Dewey, did you put
an empty egg carton

00:02:57.886 --> 00:02:59.606
and an empty milk carton
back in the fridge?

00:02:59.638 --> 00:03:00.948
How are you supposed to
know we're out of stuff

00:03:00.972 --> 00:03:02.283
if I don't put the empty
cartons in the fridge?

00:03:02.307 --> 00:03:04.187
How about you write it down
on the grocery list?

00:03:04.226 --> 00:03:05.811
Because when I do,
you ignore it.

00:03:05.894 --> 00:03:08.605
Like, here I wrote "coke,"
and you bought

00:03:08.689 --> 00:03:11.066
sim's market brand sugar cola.

00:03:11.149 --> 00:03:13.527
Do you think I want sim's
market brand milk alternative

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:14.736
for my coffee? No.

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:16.613
I want the purple half-and-half,

00:03:16.697 --> 00:03:19.491
but nobody here is making
half-and-half money, Dewey.

00:03:19.574 --> 00:03:21.827
We're making
sim's market brand money.

00:03:22.035 --> 00:03:23.554
Gotta take a shower.
I've got a new client.

00:03:23.578 --> 00:03:24.788
I can't be late.

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:27.958
(Telephone ringing)

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:31.294
Heho? Hey, son.

00:03:31.378 --> 00:03:33.004
Hey, dad. Is your mom there?

00:03:33.088 --> 00:03:34.089
She's in the shower.

00:03:34.172 --> 00:03:35.732
She's working
for that new client today.

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:37.694
All right. Let her know
I'm running a little late.

00:03:37.718 --> 00:03:38.719
I lost track of time.

00:03:38.802 --> 00:03:40.242
Storytelling for the guys
at the gym.

00:03:40.303 --> 00:03:41.722
Mom seems real stressed, dad.

00:03:41.805 --> 00:03:43.265
Hey, when I get home,
I'll give her

00:03:43.348 --> 00:03:44.641
a rocky Johnson foot massage.

00:03:44.725 --> 00:03:45.767
That'll take care of it.

00:03:45.851 --> 00:03:47.269
Well, since I waited 20 minutes

00:03:47.352 --> 00:03:49.271
for the phone to open up,
let's not waste it.

00:03:49.354 --> 00:03:50.998
Hey, how's it going
with that girl you like?

00:03:51.022 --> 00:03:53.442
Fine-ass Karen. And not good.

00:03:53.525 --> 00:03:54.526
I want to ask her out,

00:03:54.609 --> 00:03:55.837
but so does every other guy
in school.

00:03:55.861 --> 00:03:59.072
Well, son,
you are not every other guy.

00:03:59.156 --> 00:04:01.324
You just need to figure out
what you can offer her

00:04:01.408 --> 00:04:02.409
that no one else can.

00:04:03.326 --> 00:04:06.329
My hans and Franz impression
from Saturday night live.

00:04:06.788 --> 00:04:08.248
I don't know
what that means, son,

00:04:08.331 --> 00:04:09.958
but you gotta step your game up.

00:04:10.041 --> 00:04:12.961
Be confident.
Girls like swagger.

00:04:13.044 --> 00:04:14.880
And don't wait
to make your move.

00:04:14.963 --> 00:04:17.799
For every second you hesitate,
there's another guy out there

00:04:17.883 --> 00:04:20.761
telling your girl she'd look
better with less makeup.

00:04:20.844 --> 00:04:23.305
Adult Dwayne:
So I wasn't gonna hesitate.

00:04:23.638 --> 00:04:24.931
(Liv/n' on a prayer playing)

00:04:25.015 --> 00:04:26.725
Dewey, I'm leaving.
See you tonight!

00:04:26.808 --> 00:04:27.976
Okay, ma, see you later!

00:04:28.769 --> 00:04:30.538
Adult Dwayne: This girl Karen
thought I was rich,

00:04:30.562 --> 00:04:32.230
and I sure as hell wasn't.

00:04:33.064 --> 00:04:34.065
So I had to impress her

00:04:34.149 --> 00:04:35.859
with the best
stolen clothes I had.

00:04:39.029 --> 00:04:41.156
That's right,
those are girbaud jeans.

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:43.700
Living on a prayer

00:04:43.784 --> 00:04:45.118
I had my gear.

00:04:45.202 --> 00:04:46.787
Now I just had to catch my ride.

00:04:51.792 --> 00:04:53.627
Bus driver: Hello, hello.

00:04:54.711 --> 00:04:57.255
Uh, sir, you need to be
a student to ride this bus.

00:04:57.506 --> 00:04:58.507
I am a student.

00:04:59.174 --> 00:05:01.343
You got some stones, pervert.

00:05:03.678 --> 00:05:05.722
Gabe, yo,
tell him I'm a student!

00:05:05.806 --> 00:05:07.516
Are those girbaud jeans?

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:14.523
So, I think mondays
and Thursdays to start,

00:05:14.606 --> 00:05:17.126
and if you have any questions or
you need anything, just let me know.

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:19.152
Okay. Thank you, Mrs. Ariti.

00:05:19.236 --> 00:05:22.906
Oh, please, call me Diane.
Do you have any kids?

00:05:23.073 --> 00:05:24.825
I have a daughter, supposedly.

00:05:24.908 --> 00:05:26.188
She hasn't called
in three weeks.

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:30.664
I'm learning to cook Indian
but I can't find the spices!

00:05:30.831 --> 00:05:33.500
So, if it hadn't been
for that second Margarita,

00:05:33.583 --> 00:05:36.127
you'd be looking at
Mrs. Kelsey grammer right now.

00:05:36.211 --> 00:05:38.630
And I just don't think
I'm a good hugger!

00:05:38.713 --> 00:05:40.173
Do you think
I should get a facelift?

00:05:40.257 --> 00:05:41.258
Be honest.

00:05:41.967 --> 00:05:44.386
I have a shrimp allergy!

00:05:44.469 --> 00:05:46.263
Clark got me this
for my birthday.

00:05:46.429 --> 00:05:49.516
He was always getting me
expensive, insulting gifts.

00:05:49.599 --> 00:05:51.726
Bicycle, gym membership,
diet pills...

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:53.562
Oh, my god,
those aren't real problems.

00:05:54.312 --> 00:05:55.689
Paying rent,
keeping the lights on,

00:05:55.772 --> 00:05:57.065
those are real problems.

00:05:57.858 --> 00:05:59.109
Oh, right.

00:05:59.192 --> 00:06:00.193
Of course.

00:06:00.944 --> 00:06:02.255
I could pay you
a dollar more an hour.

00:06:02.279 --> 00:06:03.589
No, no, that's not
what I was asking.

00:06:03.613 --> 00:06:05.591
I just used to pay what my
neighbor paid, but she moved...

00:06:05.615 --> 00:06:06.935
Let's just forget
I said anything.

00:06:14.207 --> 00:06:16.185
Young Dwayne: I can't believe
he wouldn't let me on the bus.

00:06:16.209 --> 00:06:17.609
I was so late
that I missed homeroom

00:06:17.669 --> 00:06:18.670
with fine-ass Karen.

00:06:18.962 --> 00:06:20.314
She didn't get to see
the newjeans I stole

00:06:20.338 --> 00:06:22.048
or my hans and Franz.

00:06:22.132 --> 00:06:23.592
What if I miss
my window with her?

00:06:23.884 --> 00:06:26.678
Dude, honestly, I don't know
ifyourjeans

00:06:26.761 --> 00:06:28.638
or your impression
would have mattered.

00:06:28.722 --> 00:06:31.308
Karen has crazy high standards.

00:06:31.391 --> 00:06:32.475
Let's all go to the lobby

00:06:32.559 --> 00:06:33.560
take me home.

00:06:34.603 --> 00:06:35.896
Take me home.

00:06:36.229 --> 00:06:37.814
Karen

00:06:37.898 --> 00:06:38.899
take me home.

00:06:40.108 --> 00:06:42.694
Um, we're at your house.

00:06:44.321 --> 00:06:45.864
Well, take yourself home then.

00:06:50.118 --> 00:06:51.202
Gabe: My god.

00:06:51.286 --> 00:06:53.038
It's the karens! What?

00:06:53.121 --> 00:06:55.165
It's the Karen's! No, here?

00:06:55.457 --> 00:06:57.500
(Song playing) Taking me

00:06:57.584 --> 00:06:58.960
to the point of no return

00:06:59.044 --> 00:07:00.204
young Dwayne: Fine-ass Karen.

00:07:00.921 --> 00:07:02.547
(Expose point of no return)

00:07:02.631 --> 00:07:04.174
Big hair Karen.

00:07:04.507 --> 00:07:05.926
Colorblind Karen. (Dwayne sighs)

00:07:06.968 --> 00:07:08.053
And Bonnie.

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:11.598
They made her an honorary
Karen 'cause it's her car.

00:07:11.681 --> 00:07:13.161
Yo, they're coming.
They're coming in.

00:07:14.726 --> 00:07:16.120
Young Dwayne: What are
we doing? Yo, I don't know man!

00:07:16.144 --> 00:07:17.145
Just be cool!

00:07:17.228 --> 00:07:18.748
I'm gonna put
these peppers on a plate.

00:07:19.564 --> 00:07:21.733
(Song continues)

00:07:22.025 --> 00:07:23.568
I'd like to feel the passion

00:07:23.652 --> 00:07:25.445
to the point of no return

00:07:25.528 --> 00:07:26.947
on, baby

00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:29.216
adult Dwayne: The universe was
giving me a second chance,

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:31.993
and like my dad said,
I had to be confident.

00:07:32.077 --> 00:07:33.495
Yo, let's go over.

00:07:33.745 --> 00:07:35.163
I can't, man.

00:07:35.246 --> 00:07:36.623
I squirted pepperjuice
in my eye.

00:07:36.706 --> 00:07:38.667
Ugh. Ow.

00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:40.502
Go over there
for the both of us.

00:07:40.585 --> 00:07:41.962
(Exhales)

00:07:44.756 --> 00:07:46.967
Hello, ladies. Karen: Hi, Tomas.

00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:49.528
Adult Dwayne: Oh, yeah, I also
told her that my name was Tomas.

00:07:49.552 --> 00:07:51.763
Karen: Missed you in homeroom.
Tomas: Oh, I was shaving.

00:07:51.846 --> 00:07:52.847
Lost track of time.

00:07:53.098 --> 00:07:55.350
Big hair Karen: So why are you
even working here?

00:07:55.433 --> 00:07:57.227
I thought Karen
said you were rich.

00:07:57.310 --> 00:07:59.938
Oh, this isn't a moneyjob.
This is a build-characterjob.

00:08:00.063 --> 00:08:01.165
Colorblind Karen: I totally
get it.

00:08:01.189 --> 00:08:02.816
My cousin's
a construction worker.

00:08:03.108 --> 00:08:04.388
My dad's
a professional wrestler.

00:08:04.776 --> 00:08:05.920
That's where our family money
comes from.

00:08:05.944 --> 00:08:06.945
Oh, yeah?

00:08:07.195 --> 00:08:09.239
My dad bought wrestlemania III
on pay-per-view.

00:08:09.322 --> 00:08:10.323
Was your dad in that?

00:08:10.407 --> 00:08:12.617
No, but he's friends
with all the guys who were.

00:08:12.701 --> 00:08:15.036
I once spent a beautiful day
with Andre the giant

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:16.121
when I was a kid.

00:08:16.204 --> 00:08:17.580
Fezzik!

00:08:17.664 --> 00:08:19.874
That's his character's name
in "the Princess bride".

00:08:21.042 --> 00:08:23.086
Well, that's interesting.

00:08:23.169 --> 00:08:25.088
Not what Bonnie said,
but what you said.

00:08:25.171 --> 00:08:27.632
The last guy I dated's dad
was vice president

00:08:27.716 --> 00:08:29.676
for the acquisitions
of-who cares?

00:08:29.759 --> 00:08:30.969
So boring.

00:08:31.052 --> 00:08:32.804
You know, I was
actually talking about you

00:08:32.887 --> 00:08:34.389
with my dad this morning.
Karen: What?

00:08:34.472 --> 00:08:36.433
Karen: No, you weren't. I was.

00:08:36.516 --> 00:08:38.059
I told him I wanted
to ask you out.

00:08:38.643 --> 00:08:40.437
You know what he told me? What?

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:43.815
He told me to offer you
what the other guys can't.

00:08:44.149 --> 00:08:45.442
Oh, yeah, and what's that?

00:08:46.776 --> 00:08:48.069
(German accent) I'm hans.

00:08:48.153 --> 00:08:51.656
I'm Franz.
And we want to pump you up.

00:08:58.121 --> 00:09:00.999
I love hans and Franz.
Call me later.

00:09:01.082 --> 00:09:03.668
(Upbeat music playing)

00:09:04.711 --> 00:09:06.791
Announcer: The "soul
man" has withstood the onslaught

00:09:06.838 --> 00:09:10.300
by roddy Piper and is now
all over the rowdy one!

00:09:10.383 --> 00:09:11.426
(Crowd cheering)

00:09:11.509 --> 00:09:13.344
Here comes
the signature drop kick!

00:09:14.137 --> 00:09:15.138
(Crowd applauding)

00:09:15.221 --> 00:09:16.222
Is it over?

00:09:16.306 --> 00:09:17.599
(Crowd chanting) One, two...

00:09:17.682 --> 00:09:19.934
Three, the crowd goes wild!

00:09:20.018 --> 00:09:22.020
Rocky, rocky, rocky!

00:09:22.103 --> 00:09:24.981
Like I said, I don't really
watch wrestling.

00:09:25.482 --> 00:09:26.566
Sure you do.

00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:28.210
Let me tell you
about this other time.

00:09:28.234 --> 00:09:29.569
So I had this brother, right?

00:09:29.819 --> 00:09:31.529
Well, I feel awful.

00:09:31.821 --> 00:09:33.114
Isnapped at my new client today,

00:09:33.198 --> 00:09:34.949
so now I'm making her
apology musubis.

00:09:35.033 --> 00:09:37.035
Do like we do out here
in Hawaii.

00:09:37.243 --> 00:09:39.829
Send mangoes,
the fruit of forgiveness.

00:09:41.081 --> 00:09:42.957
There he is.
I did what you said.

00:09:43.208 --> 00:09:44.667
I stepped to Karen
with confidence,

00:09:44.751 --> 00:09:45.831
and she gave me her number.

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:47.045
Oh, that's great, son.

00:09:47.128 --> 00:09:48.189
I told you that would work.

00:09:48.213 --> 00:09:49.923
Gonna call her tonight
after I work out

00:09:50.006 --> 00:09:51.883
so I can say,
"I just worked out."

00:09:51.966 --> 00:09:54.052
Smooth as hell, son.
Keep your foot on the gas.

00:09:54.135 --> 00:09:55.136
Don't let up.

00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:56.721
Rocky, did that promoter
pay you yet?

00:09:56.805 --> 00:09:58.807
Uh, no, we got a match
on Saturday.

00:09:58.890 --> 00:10:00.250
Office said
he's gonna pay us then.

00:10:00.433 --> 00:10:01.869
Young Dwayne: Where's your
match on Saturday?

00:10:01.893 --> 00:10:04.270
North Hampton college. Sold out.

00:10:04.437 --> 00:10:06.606
Really? Totally sold out.

00:10:06.689 --> 00:10:07.982
Oh, I'm gonna blow their minds.

00:10:08.066 --> 00:10:10.110
Like that time I went up
against Paul orndorff...

00:10:10.193 --> 00:10:12.987
(School bell rings)

00:10:13.071 --> 00:10:14.739
(Funky music)

00:10:15.615 --> 00:10:18.118
Hello, Dwayne.
How's student life?

00:10:18.201 --> 00:10:20.537
Hey, principal Bogg. It's good.

00:10:21.204 --> 00:10:23.307
That was for the benefit
of the kids, officer Johnson.

00:10:23.331 --> 00:10:24.999
I don't want to blow your cover.

00:10:25.291 --> 00:10:27.794
Any leads on the rash
of locker break-ins?

00:10:27.877 --> 00:10:30.505
Again, I'm not a narc.
Of course.

00:10:30.588 --> 00:10:32.423
You can't talk
on school premises.

00:10:32.507 --> 00:10:35.051
I'll make us a reservation
at Morton's steakhouse.

00:10:35.135 --> 00:10:36.511
You can brief me later.

00:10:36.594 --> 00:10:38.638
Hey, stay safe out there.

00:10:41.307 --> 00:10:42.725
What?

00:10:42.809 --> 00:10:44.561
(Funky music)

00:10:45.145 --> 00:10:49.149
Karen, Karen, Karen, Bonnie.

00:10:49.232 --> 00:10:50.358
You can call me Karen.

00:10:50.441 --> 00:10:51.985
Is it me,
or is he wearing all red?

00:10:52.193 --> 00:10:54.195
It's you. Hi, Tomas.

00:10:54.279 --> 00:10:55.673
Fun talking to you
on the phone last night.

00:10:55.697 --> 00:10:57.617
Think how fun itwill be
when we talk face-to-face

00:10:57.657 --> 00:10:58.658
on our date.

00:10:58.950 --> 00:11:01.119
Karen, you didn't tell us
he asked you out.

00:11:01.202 --> 00:11:03.955
He didn't, Karen.
It's happening right now.

00:11:04.038 --> 00:11:05.456
No fricking way.

00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:08.334
My dad is wrestling at north
Hampton college on Saturday.

00:11:08.418 --> 00:11:10.378
It's sold out,
but I can get us in.

00:11:10.461 --> 00:11:13.339
Snag us some vip passes,
hang backstage.

00:11:13.423 --> 00:11:15.049
That would be pretty exciting.

00:11:15.133 --> 00:11:16.384
I've never seen alive show.

00:11:18.386 --> 00:11:21.181
See, Kevin?
That's how you do it.

00:11:24.767 --> 00:11:26.019
(Song playing) Baby

00:11:26.102 --> 00:11:28.146
I can't wait

00:11:30.481 --> 00:11:31.608
mmm.

00:11:31.691 --> 00:11:34.986
They taste like hope
for a better future.

00:11:35.069 --> 00:11:36.446
(Chuckles)

00:11:36.529 --> 00:11:38.507
Thank you for these,
but you really didn't have to.

00:11:38.531 --> 00:11:41.242
It's the least I could do
after how I spoke to you.

00:11:41.326 --> 00:11:44.245
It's not an excuse,
but my husband's been having

00:11:44.329 --> 00:11:46.331
work issues,
and money's been tight.

00:11:46.414 --> 00:11:48.041
Anyway, I'm sorry.

00:11:48.124 --> 00:11:49.334
I'm sorry too.

00:11:49.417 --> 00:11:51.336
Ever since my daughter
left home and my divorce,

00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:53.588
I've been a little lonely.

00:11:54.714 --> 00:11:56.633
I guess I got overexcited
at having company.

00:11:56.716 --> 00:11:59.427
Family tests you whether
they're here or they're gone.

00:11:59.510 --> 00:12:00.637
Amen.

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:02.805
Just like Sally Jesse says,
"we're expected

00:12:02.889 --> 00:12:05.016
to react to the needs
of the people around us."

00:12:06.893 --> 00:12:07.894
Who's Sally Jesse?

00:12:08.478 --> 00:12:09.687
Sally Jesse Raphael.

00:12:11.064 --> 00:12:13.066
The yellow haired hawk
of daytime talk.

00:12:14.067 --> 00:12:15.818
Oh, come with me. Come with me.

00:12:16.819 --> 00:12:19.656
And I was like, "no, Bonnie,
a perm would not do well

00:12:19.739 --> 00:12:20.907
"with your face structure."

00:12:21.199 --> 00:12:23.243
And that is how
I saved her life.

00:12:23.326 --> 00:12:24.994
What would she do without you?

00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:30.250
Wow, this place
really is sold out.

00:12:30.917 --> 00:12:33.127
I'll talk to the guy,
tell him who we are.

00:12:35.463 --> 00:12:36.506
Here for the flea market?

00:12:36.589 --> 00:12:38.132
We're here
for the wrestling match.

00:12:38.216 --> 00:12:39.467
Yep, you're in the right place.

00:12:39.550 --> 00:12:41.028
That's right between
the vintage coats

00:12:41.052 --> 00:12:42.095
and French armoires.

00:12:44.097 --> 00:12:45.741
Adult Dwayne: Now, lknew
my dad wasn't wrestling

00:12:45.765 --> 00:12:46.975
in packed arenas anymore,

00:12:47.058 --> 00:12:48.893
but he definitely
stretched the truth

00:12:48.977 --> 00:12:49.978
about this venue.

00:12:50.061 --> 00:12:51.729
Dewey! (Rock chuckles)

00:12:51.813 --> 00:12:54.774
Well, well, well,
and this must be Karen.

00:12:54.857 --> 00:12:56.943
Oh, what a surprise.
Karen: Dewey?

00:12:57.235 --> 00:12:59.028
My nickname. It's a
nickname for Tomas?

00:12:59.112 --> 00:13:00.863
Tomas? His name is Dwayne.

00:13:00.947 --> 00:13:02.532
Is this true, Tomas?

00:13:04.450 --> 00:13:06.077
You said you were wrestling
at a college.

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:07.662
Yeah, this is at a college.

00:13:07.745 --> 00:13:09.622
This is a flea market
next to a college.

00:13:09.706 --> 00:13:11.499
Commemorative
bicentennial spoons?

00:13:11.582 --> 00:13:14.544
Ew, I am not buying used spoons.

00:13:14.627 --> 00:13:16.796
Vintage t-shirts, young lady?
You a fan of gwar?

00:13:17.839 --> 00:13:19.424
Karen: Dwayne! One sec.

00:13:20.258 --> 00:13:22.468
Look at her, dad. She's not
the flea market type.

00:13:22.552 --> 00:13:24.392
You know I've been trying
to impress this girl.

00:13:24.470 --> 00:13:26.681
All right, all right, I might
have hyped it up a bit,

00:13:26.764 --> 00:13:28.099
but the crowd is pumped.

00:13:29.642 --> 00:13:30.911
Young Dwayne: There's, like,
ten people here.

00:13:30.935 --> 00:13:32.895
Now, see, there was 11,
but this woman fainted

00:13:32.979 --> 00:13:34.981
when she heard
I was on the card.

00:13:35.898 --> 00:13:37.817
Yeah, she saw me wrestle
Mr. Fuji

00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:39.402
at the garden years ago.

00:13:39.485 --> 00:13:41.154
Now, that was a hell of a match.

00:13:41.237 --> 00:13:43.656
Okay, sure, my dad
stretched the truth

00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:46.117
to make himself look good,
but he was also used

00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:48.369
to a certain level of success
that he wasn't

00:13:48.453 --> 00:13:49.537
ready to give up.

00:13:49.620 --> 00:13:51.831
So fuji's about to throw salt
in my eyes, right?

00:13:51.914 --> 00:13:52.957
Dwayne, can we go?

00:13:53.499 --> 00:13:54.768
There is a woman
trying to sell me

00:13:54.792 --> 00:13:57.337
what I think
is a racist syrup jar.

00:13:58.171 --> 00:14:00.423
Um, we gotta...
Oh, wait, wait, no.

00:14:00.506 --> 00:14:01.986
You can't leave
before the main event.

00:14:06.054 --> 00:14:07.055
For sure, we're staying.

00:14:07.347 --> 00:14:09.182
No way we're missing
a rocky Johnson show.

00:14:10.475 --> 00:14:11.559
That's my boy.

00:14:12.727 --> 00:14:15.063
Rocky, showtime.
Rocky: Great. Thanks, hal.

00:14:15.146 --> 00:14:16.647
I'll see you two
after the match?

00:14:18.483 --> 00:14:19.484
No way we're staying.

00:14:19.942 --> 00:14:22.737
There is a man selling
a pile of old baby shoes,

00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:24.113
and it is freaking me out.

00:14:25.073 --> 00:14:27.992
If you want to leave,
go ahead, but I'm staying.

00:14:30.661 --> 00:14:31.746
He's my dad.

00:14:34.832 --> 00:14:36.584
Like Karen, I'm also confused.

00:14:36.667 --> 00:14:37.668
Why did you stay?

00:14:39.295 --> 00:14:40.338
He's my dad.

00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:44.801
That's it.

00:14:49.430 --> 00:14:50.431
Wait.

00:14:52.767 --> 00:14:54.453
Woman: And it's really
unusual, I think, to hear women

00:14:54.477 --> 00:14:55.937
say this,
looks are more important

00:14:56.020 --> 00:14:58.022
than brains? Oh, yeah.

00:14:58.106 --> 00:14:59.774
I think I would like
a dumb, hot man.

00:14:59.941 --> 00:15:01.943
Clark was basically
a giant brain

00:15:02.026 --> 00:15:04.278
attached to the body
of an uncooked chicken.

00:15:04.362 --> 00:15:06.114
(Laughs)

00:15:06.197 --> 00:15:08.282
I'd like a man
who can put his ego aside.

00:15:08.533 --> 00:15:10.701
I love rocky,
but he always exaggerates

00:15:10.785 --> 00:15:12.805
to make himself look good
when he doesn't even have to.

00:15:12.829 --> 00:15:13.871
It's exhausting.

00:15:13.955 --> 00:15:15.873
Still, sounds better than Clark.

00:15:16.374 --> 00:15:19.752
An uncooked chicken, ata.
(Laughs)

00:15:21.629 --> 00:15:23.506
Oh, I have to go.

00:15:23.589 --> 00:15:24.900
Yeah, I still gotta go
to the grocery store

00:15:24.924 --> 00:15:26.300
and get dinner ready.

00:15:26.384 --> 00:15:28.803
You have to take time
for yourself too.

00:15:28.886 --> 00:15:30.138
"Find the little joys,

00:15:30.221 --> 00:15:31.889
"for they give us
the greatest pleasures."

00:15:34.767 --> 00:15:35.828
Did you just come up with that?

00:15:35.852 --> 00:15:36.978
No, that's sjr.

00:15:37.061 --> 00:15:39.342
She said it to a toothless
woman addicted to crystal meth.

00:15:39.647 --> 00:15:41.816
I recorded it. I'll show you.

00:15:43.568 --> 00:15:45.069
Got us some snacks.

00:15:45.153 --> 00:15:46.833
That's what my family buys
to feed the fish

00:15:46.863 --> 00:15:47.989
when we go to the poconos.

00:15:48.072 --> 00:15:49.615
(Screams) (Screams)

00:15:49.699 --> 00:15:52.535
(Chuckles)
Hey, uncle of a, uncle sika.

00:15:52.618 --> 00:15:54.495
This is Karen. Hi, Karen.

00:15:55.413 --> 00:15:56.622
(Screams)

00:15:56.706 --> 00:15:58.458
(Sika laughs)

00:15:58.541 --> 00:16:00.543
Bye, Karen.

00:16:00.626 --> 00:16:02.426
Should've gone white water
rafting with Kevin.

00:16:03.421 --> 00:16:05.548
Okay, yeah, this place sucks,

00:16:05.631 --> 00:16:07.216
but I promise
you're in for a show.

00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:09.719
Announcer: In this
corner, the "soul man"!

00:16:09.802 --> 00:16:11.530
Adult Dwayne: Even though
my dad wasn't wrestling

00:16:11.554 --> 00:16:13.139
in Madison square garden
anymore,

00:16:13.222 --> 00:16:14.807
in his mind, he was.

00:16:14.891 --> 00:16:16.934
(Sam and Dave "soul man")

00:16:17.018 --> 00:16:21.105
And his opponent,
hailing from the ocean,

00:16:21.189 --> 00:16:23.774
the gull!

00:16:23.858 --> 00:16:25.026
(Screams)

00:16:25.109 --> 00:16:28.988
Ooh, a dirty attack
by the gull before the bell.

00:16:29.989 --> 00:16:32.408
And whether it was the gull
or Rick flair

00:16:32.492 --> 00:16:33.951
or roddy Piper,

00:16:34.035 --> 00:16:35.828
anytime rocky Johnson
got in that ring,

00:16:35.912 --> 00:16:37.788
he went all out.

00:16:37.872 --> 00:16:40.082
(Song playing) That's what!
Got, the hard way

00:16:40.166 --> 00:16:42.502
and I'll make it better
each and every day

00:16:42.585 --> 00:16:44.879
it's so violent in real life.

00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:47.590
Ah, ah! Ow!

00:16:47.882 --> 00:16:49.359
(Song playing)' Cause
you ain't seen nothing yet

00:16:49.383 --> 00:16:51.969
if he doesn't sell
and get his opponent over,

00:16:52.053 --> 00:16:53.653
there's no point
in blowing his comeback.

00:16:54.263 --> 00:16:55.723
What does that mean?

00:16:55.806 --> 00:16:58.100
Rocky: Ow!

00:16:58.184 --> 00:17:00.102
(Song playing) I'm a soul man

00:17:00.186 --> 00:17:02.396
stop it! He's hurt!

00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:03.640
(Song playing) I'm a soul man

00:17:04.857 --> 00:17:06.484
rocky reaches the ropes.

00:17:06.567 --> 00:17:09.487
The gull has to let him go
or be disqualified.

00:17:09.570 --> 00:17:11.447
(Audience booing) Caw!

00:17:11.531 --> 00:17:13.407
I hate you!

00:17:14.450 --> 00:17:16.160
(Mouthing) She's loving it.

00:17:17.537 --> 00:17:20.414
Adult Dwayne: Nobody put on
a show like the "soul man".

00:17:20.498 --> 00:17:23.125
Rocky, rocky, rocky! Rocky.

00:17:23.209 --> 00:17:25.419
(All chanting)
Rocky, rocky, rocky!

00:17:25.503 --> 00:17:28.214
(Crowd cheering)
Rocky, rocky, rocky!

00:17:28.297 --> 00:17:29.549
(Song playing) I'm a soul man

00:17:29.632 --> 00:17:30.675
(all cheering)

00:17:30.758 --> 00:17:31.884
(Grunts)

00:17:31.968 --> 00:17:33.928
(Song playing) I'm a soul man

00:17:35.263 --> 00:17:36.305
whoo!

00:17:36.889 --> 00:17:38.951
(Song playing) Well, grab the
rope, let me pull you in

00:17:38.975 --> 00:17:42.728
(song playing) Give you hope
and be your only boyfriend

00:17:42.812 --> 00:17:45.189
(song playing) Yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah

00:17:45.273 --> 00:17:46.649
(crowd chanting) One, two...

00:17:46.732 --> 00:17:47.900
Three!

00:17:47.984 --> 00:17:49.569
(Cheers and applause)

00:17:49.652 --> 00:17:52.005
Adult Dwayne: Like my dad,
I had been exaggerating the truth

00:17:52.029 --> 00:17:55.241
to make myself look good,
but when I finally got real

00:17:55.324 --> 00:17:58.327
and chose to be there for him
over impressing the girl,

00:17:58.411 --> 00:17:59.704
I somehow got the girl.

00:17:59.787 --> 00:18:01.539
That was amazing!

00:18:01.622 --> 00:18:02.748
What did I tell you?

00:18:02.832 --> 00:18:04.625
Nobody puts on a show
like my dad.

00:18:05.835 --> 00:18:08.963
(Cheers and applause)

00:18:10.214 --> 00:18:11.799
That was so fun.

00:18:11.882 --> 00:18:13.634
You set the bar high
for our next date.

00:18:13.718 --> 00:18:14.844
Next date?

00:18:14.927 --> 00:18:17.388
Oh, is that before or after
you go rafting with Kevin?

00:18:17.471 --> 00:18:19.557
Shut up.

00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:20.742
Man 4: Hi, rocky! Rocky: Hey.

00:18:20.766 --> 00:18:22.143
Amazing, dad.

00:18:22.226 --> 00:18:23.311
You put on a show.

00:18:23.394 --> 00:18:24.687
You were so great, Mr. Johnson.

00:18:24.770 --> 00:18:26.981
Why, thank you, Karen.
Appreciate that, son.

00:18:27.064 --> 00:18:28.458
I've never seen
wrestling live before,

00:18:28.482 --> 00:18:30.401
and it was so much better
than on TV.

00:18:30.484 --> 00:18:32.724
Kind of like that time I saw
kirk Cameron at the airport.

00:18:33.779 --> 00:18:35.465
Hal: Hey, hell of a match,
rocky. Hell of a match.

00:18:35.489 --> 00:18:36.741
Finally, payday.

00:18:39.035 --> 00:18:41.037
Rocky: Where's the rest?
Hal: That's $300.

00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:42.747
It was 300 per match.

00:18:42.830 --> 00:18:44.248
I wrestled
three matches for you.

00:18:44.332 --> 00:18:45.875
No, 300 total.

00:18:48.461 --> 00:18:49.545
Just give us a second.

00:18:49.629 --> 00:18:50.963
Business.

00:18:51.964 --> 00:18:54.175
Karen: $300? That's all?

00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:56.177
Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah, hedoeswtdo

00:18:56.260 --> 00:18:57.595
these smaller shows for money.

00:18:57.678 --> 00:18:59.278
He just does 'em
as a favor to my uncles.

00:18:59.347 --> 00:19:00.348
Oh. Yeah.

00:19:00.431 --> 00:19:02.743
Still, though, you want to keep
these local promoters honest

00:19:02.767 --> 00:19:05.102
but he makes the real money
at the big shows.

00:19:05.186 --> 00:19:07.563
Oh, well, I'd love
to see one of those.

00:19:08.064 --> 00:19:09.690
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
for sure.

00:19:09.774 --> 00:19:10.876
I'll take you to the next one.

00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:13.277
Hey, you know,
my dad has a ton of merch.

00:19:13.361 --> 00:19:14.987
Mmm-hmm. You want a hat?

00:19:15.071 --> 00:19:16.614
I'll bring you a hat on Monday.

00:19:17.073 --> 00:19:20.493
(Ata singing) So the wind
might change direction

00:19:20.576 --> 00:19:23.871
and you stay always as you are

00:19:23.954 --> 00:19:25.706
I've always loved that song.

00:19:25.790 --> 00:19:27.030
Dwayne said the show was great.

00:19:27.083 --> 00:19:28.542
Hey, you know me.

00:19:28.626 --> 00:19:30.294
My worst day
is someone else's best day.

00:19:30.378 --> 00:19:31.420
(Chuckles)

00:19:32.630 --> 00:19:34.423
Hey, I'm sorry about the money.

00:19:34.507 --> 00:19:36.008
Hal swore he was-ata: Hey.

00:19:36.092 --> 00:19:38.719
$300 is $300. We could use it.

00:19:39.553 --> 00:19:41.615
But next time, we gotta
make sure you get paid upfront.

00:19:41.639 --> 00:19:43.265
Definitely.

00:19:43.349 --> 00:19:46.727
Plus this convention in erie
will bring in some extra dough.

00:19:46.811 --> 00:19:49.188
Pose for pictures,
sign some autographs.

00:19:49.271 --> 00:19:50.815
It'll be great.

00:19:54.610 --> 00:19:57.196
Hey, babe, what's with
this small, purple milk?

00:19:57.279 --> 00:19:58.698
It's my little joy.

00:19:58.781 --> 00:19:59.966
I put it behind the cantaloupe

00:19:59.990 --> 00:20:01.593
so Dewey doesn't drink it all
in one gulp.

00:20:01.617 --> 00:20:03.119
Smart.

00:20:03.202 --> 00:20:05.079
No way that boy's
going near a melon.

00:20:05.162 --> 00:20:06.205
Mmm-hmm.

00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:09.875
That is a sweet end
to the story.

00:20:09.959 --> 00:20:11.961
Would've been, yeah,
but that's not the end.

00:20:12.044 --> 00:20:13.671
Unless we want it to be.

00:20:13.754 --> 00:20:14.922
Sandy, please.

00:20:15.005 --> 00:20:16.685
Can someone get
this Sandy guy out of here?

00:20:17.967 --> 00:20:19.760
Bitch trying to step
into my coverage.

00:20:19.844 --> 00:20:22.012
Sorry about that. That's okay.

00:20:22.096 --> 00:20:24.223
You know, Randall, look,
I'm here to be honest,

00:20:24.306 --> 00:20:26.100
and that's why I told you
this story.

00:20:26.267 --> 00:20:28.352
No one's perfect,
and we all make mistakes.

00:20:28.936 --> 00:20:31.331
Adult Dwayne: I just happened
to make a whole hell of a lot of them.

00:20:31.355 --> 00:20:32.815
Hey, Karen.

00:20:32.898 --> 00:20:34.984
I brought you this.
Karen: Thanks.

00:20:35.067 --> 00:20:36.068
Nice jeans.

00:20:36.861 --> 00:20:38.422
I was just telling everyone
about the match.

00:20:38.446 --> 00:20:40.114
When your dad did
that sunset flip-

00:20:40.197 --> 00:20:41.699
which was badass-

00:20:41.782 --> 00:20:43.701
it, like,
totally changed my life.

00:20:43.909 --> 00:20:45.828
Ugh, at the flea market?

00:20:46.787 --> 00:20:49.039
Ugh, yes,
that part was disgusting.

00:20:49.123 --> 00:20:52.710
It was like a cursed mall,
but the show was really fun.

00:20:52.793 --> 00:20:55.045
Kevin: Aw, that's awesome, man.

00:20:55.129 --> 00:20:57.089
My neighbor's throwing
a garage sale next week.

00:20:57.173 --> 00:20:58.525
Maybe your dad can
main event that.

00:20:58.549 --> 00:21:00.509
(Laughing) My brother was there.

00:21:00.593 --> 00:21:03.471
He said there were, like,
ten people in the audience.

00:21:03.554 --> 00:21:04.930
There's ten people
here right now.

00:21:05.014 --> 00:21:07.016
This was the audience.

00:21:07.099 --> 00:21:09.935
I mean, it doesn't even matter.
Wrestling's all fake anyway.

00:21:12.980 --> 00:21:14.148
(Crowd gasping) Oh!

00:21:14.231 --> 00:21:15.232
(Gasps)

00:21:16.442 --> 00:21:18.903
Never use the f-word.

00:21:18.986 --> 00:21:20.696
Randall: Wait, so you
knocked him out cold.

00:21:20.780 --> 00:21:22.907
Ah. Um...

00:21:23.866 --> 00:21:26.535
We just scooped
everyone in the country.

00:21:26.619 --> 00:21:28.412
Scooped 'em all.
Randall: Yeah, we did.

00:21:28.496 --> 00:21:29.497
(Both chuckle)
