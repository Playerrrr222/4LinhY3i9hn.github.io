00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:07.132
(Lively news theme)

00:00:07.216 --> 00:00:08.800
Good evening, I'm Randall park.

00:00:08.884 --> 00:00:10.511
The primaries are over
and the nominees

00:00:10.594 --> 00:00:14.348
for the 2032 us.
Presidential race are set.

00:00:14.431 --> 00:00:16.892
And one name...

00:00:16.975 --> 00:00:19.061
You may have heard before.

00:00:19.144 --> 00:00:21.897
Candidate Dwayne Johnson
has wasted no time

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:23.482
hitting the campaign trail

00:00:23.565 --> 00:00:26.193
with his
no muss, no fuss bus tour,

00:00:26.276 --> 00:00:29.821
traveling cross-country
to talk to American voters.

00:00:29.905 --> 00:00:32.866
(Cheering)

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:34.117
I'll get the upstairs.

00:00:34.201 --> 00:00:36.578
Randall: And show
that he's one of them.

00:00:37.746 --> 00:00:39.790
(Grunts) Wow.

00:00:40.249 --> 00:00:42.167
It's about as big
as Kevin hart's ego.

00:00:42.251 --> 00:00:43.460
(Laughter)

00:00:43.544 --> 00:00:47.089
Randall: But that level of
fame also has its downside.

00:00:47.172 --> 00:00:49.633
Dwayne Johnson's success
is being used against him

00:00:49.716 --> 00:00:50.717
by his critics.

00:00:50.801 --> 00:00:53.929
They say he's lived the cushy
Hollywood life for so long,

00:00:54.012 --> 00:00:55.347
he can't relate to the struggles

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:56.765
of the average American.

00:00:56.848 --> 00:00:58.743
Randall, that couldn't be
further from the truth.

00:00:58.767 --> 00:01:01.353
I have had one hell of a life.

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:02.980
But I wasn't born into it.

00:01:03.063 --> 00:01:05.416
I've had to work very hard for
everything that's come my way.

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.860
There's still so much that I
have to share with the world.

00:01:08.944 --> 00:01:10.529
Hmm, I'm surprised
to hear you say that

00:01:10.612 --> 00:01:11.972
because you're such
an open person.

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.324
Well, I try to be as open
and as real as I can.

00:01:14.408 --> 00:01:16.201
For example, people don't know

00:01:16.285 --> 00:01:17.428
that every time iopenthefndge,

00:01:17.452 --> 00:01:18.453
I still gotta...

00:01:19.413 --> 00:01:21.331
You know. (Both chuckle)

00:01:21.415 --> 00:01:22.916
Can you do it?
You want me to do it?

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.811
I'm begging you to do it.
Are the people ready?

00:01:24.835 --> 00:01:27.296
They are not ready, but they
need to see it. (Chuckles)

00:01:27.713 --> 00:01:28.856
Well, every time iopenthefndge,

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.966
I've gotta say, "can you tell...

00:01:31.425 --> 00:01:33.093
Ell...

00:01:33.927 --> 00:01:37.180
"That the rock is hungry?"

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:39.474
Oh, yeah.

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.352
I do that too. You're
a wild man. (Laughs)

00:01:42.561 --> 00:01:43.621
So, as you can see, Randall,

00:01:43.645 --> 00:01:45.647
there's still so much
that I haven't told anyone.

00:01:45.731 --> 00:01:46.857
Stories about my life

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:50.110
that I haven't been ready
to share until now.

00:01:50.193 --> 00:01:51.953
You can't tell because
I used to be an actor,

00:01:51.987 --> 00:01:53.614
so I'm skilled
at hiding my emotions,

00:01:53.697 --> 00:01:55.699
but I'm on the edge of my seat.

00:01:55.782 --> 00:01:57.367
I can't tell.
You're a hell of an actor.

00:01:57.451 --> 00:01:58.827
Oh, true.

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:00.621
(Chuckung)

00:02:00.704 --> 00:02:02.664
You know, Randall,
to understand me,

00:02:02.748 --> 00:02:04.625
you gotta understand
where I came from.

00:02:04.708 --> 00:02:05.709
(Funky music playing)

00:02:07.961 --> 00:02:10.964
Adult Dwayne: I was born
into a wrestling family. (Grunting)

00:02:11.048 --> 00:02:13.550
Randall: Your dad was
wrestling superstar rocky Johnson.

00:02:13.634 --> 00:02:15.510
Adult Dwayne:
The "sou/man" rocky Johnson.

00:02:15.594 --> 00:02:16.970
That was him. Yeah!

00:02:18.096 --> 00:02:19.449
Announcer: The crowd
is in an uproar.

00:02:19.473 --> 00:02:20.641
There he goes!

00:02:20.724 --> 00:02:22.643
Mom, listen to this crowd.

00:02:22.726 --> 00:02:24.186
Dad is over.

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:25.562
He is. They love him.

00:02:25.646 --> 00:02:26.873
Adult Dwayne: My mother's father

00:02:26.897 --> 00:02:29.566
was the legendary
Samoan wrestler,

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:30.942
"high chief" Peter maivia.

00:02:32.152 --> 00:02:34.946
Wrestling is in my blood.

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:36.490
(Crowd exclaiming)

00:02:36.573 --> 00:02:38.492
An nou ncer: Rocky
hits him with a dropkick.

00:02:38.575 --> 00:02:39.695
Audience member: Yes, rocky!

00:02:40.077 --> 00:02:41.912
Announcer: Oh, the Samoan
is in trouble now.

00:02:41.995 --> 00:02:43.413
All: Three, two... (Bell dings)

00:02:43.497 --> 00:02:44.557
Announcer: He's done, he's done!

00:02:44.581 --> 00:02:48.168
(Crowd cheering) Announcer:
And rocky Johnson is the winner tonight.

00:02:48.251 --> 00:02:51.880
Crowd: (Cheering, chanting)
Rocky!

00:02:52.297 --> 00:02:53.816
Adult Dwayne: You
know, being a kid growing up

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.276
in the world
of professional wrestling,

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:58.053
I learned a lot of stuff
very early on in life.

00:02:58.136 --> 00:02:59.304
Sign my chest!

00:02:59.388 --> 00:03:01.348
I'll sign your chest.
Uh, no, you won't.

00:03:01.431 --> 00:03:02.766
(Chuckling) Thank you.

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:06.603
Rocky: I won't be signing any
chests, but how about an arm?

00:03:08.855 --> 00:03:10.065
Is this car! Weathers?

00:03:10.148 --> 00:03:11.566
(Giggles)

00:03:12.984 --> 00:03:14.045
Adult Dwayne:
But, at the same time,

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:15.946
I was also just
a regular little boy.

00:03:20.117 --> 00:03:22.494
And I idolized my dad.

00:03:22.577 --> 00:03:26.456
Young Dwayne: Dad, how come
our car is nicer than where we're staying?

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:28.542
'Cause the fans don't drive
home with us, Dewey.

00:03:28.625 --> 00:03:30.711
They need to see me
leave the arena in ster.

00:03:30.794 --> 00:03:31.979
That's called
working the gimmick.

00:03:32.003 --> 00:03:33.255
Hmm, interesting.

00:03:33.338 --> 00:03:35.882
Rocky: Cars, the
clothes, the jewelry.

00:03:35.966 --> 00:03:37.676
They need to think
who I am inside the ring

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:39.594
is who I am outside the ring.

00:03:39.678 --> 00:03:41.263
That's why we can't hang out
in public

00:03:41.346 --> 00:03:42.514
with uncle iron sheik.

00:03:42.597 --> 00:03:44.307
That's right. And get this,

00:03:44.391 --> 00:03:47.644
one day, you work the gimmick
hard enough, it'll become real.

00:03:47.728 --> 00:03:49.229
It will? Rocky: Sure will.

00:03:49.813 --> 00:03:52.023
Soon, our house will be
as nice as our car.

00:03:52.107 --> 00:03:53.316
Then I gotta buy a better car.

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.986
Ooh, a red one?
You know I love red.

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:57.988
I know you like red.
(Both chuckle)

00:03:58.655 --> 00:04:00.031
(Young Dwayne clears throat)

00:04:00.115 --> 00:04:02.659
Hey. I'm gonna getchanged.

00:04:02.743 --> 00:04:04.745
We'll go to your grandma's
so I can get paid,

00:04:04.828 --> 00:04:07.164
then I'll take us out to dinner.
A quick stop at my mom's.

00:04:07.247 --> 00:04:08.707
Yeah, yeah, I know.

00:04:13.044 --> 00:04:15.088
Hey, get your buns in here.

00:04:15.172 --> 00:04:17.674
Hey, boys. Everyone: Hey!

00:04:17.758 --> 00:04:19.509
Both: Yo.

00:04:19.593 --> 00:04:21.052
(Dog groaning)

00:04:21.136 --> 00:04:22.637
Uh, grandma?

00:04:22.721 --> 00:04:25.015
What's wrong
with your dog again?

00:04:25.098 --> 00:04:26.975
It's a belly tumor,
but don't worry.

00:04:27.058 --> 00:04:28.101
It's benign.

00:04:28.185 --> 00:04:30.103
Is that
mushroom-looking one new?

00:04:30.812 --> 00:04:32.856
Go shake everyone's hand, Dewey.

00:04:33.565 --> 00:04:36.485
Junkyard dog,
great match tonight.

00:04:36.568 --> 00:04:39.279
(Funky music playing)

00:04:39.362 --> 00:04:40.947
Let me see how fast you are.

00:04:41.031 --> 00:04:42.824
Oh, that's quick.

00:04:42.908 --> 00:04:44.201
Damn, kid.

00:04:44.284 --> 00:04:45.660
Hi, uncle of a. Hi, uncle sika.

00:04:45.744 --> 00:04:46.995
Hey.

00:04:47.078 --> 00:04:49.039
Share the spice of life

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:52.709
I hated you guys tonight.
Greatjob.

00:04:52.793 --> 00:04:53.978
(Both speaking
in polynesian dialect)

00:04:54.002 --> 00:04:55.879
Who wants a Margarita?

00:04:55.962 --> 00:04:57.756
You will find peace of mind

00:04:57.839 --> 00:04:58.965
on the floor

00:04:59.049 --> 00:05:01.802
I make with almost
all triple sec.

00:05:01.885 --> 00:05:03.637
Shake it, baby! Dewey baby,

00:05:04.054 --> 00:05:05.347
are you old enough to drink yet?

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:07.057
Oh, I'll drink it for him.

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:09.059
(Rumbling thuds)

00:05:09.142 --> 00:05:10.685
We can boogie

00:05:10.769 --> 00:05:12.646
on down

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:13.939
down

00:05:14.022 --> 00:05:15.190
(all greeting)

00:05:15.273 --> 00:05:16.399
Everyone: Hey! Hey!

00:05:16.608 --> 00:05:19.611
Down, boogie on down

00:05:20.612 --> 00:05:22.322
anyone want to play
cards? Eve ryon e: Yes.

00:05:23.281 --> 00:05:24.991
Afa: Yeah, I'll take your money.

00:05:25.075 --> 00:05:27.285
Hey, babe, you don't mind
if we order food here, right?

00:05:27.369 --> 00:05:28.930
We were just gonna do
a quick in and out.

00:05:28.954 --> 00:05:31.081
Please, mom?
I want to hang with the guys.

00:05:31.164 --> 00:05:32.916
Ah, that's my boy.

00:05:32.999 --> 00:05:34.977
Hey, and after, I promise
we'll get some ice cream.

00:05:35.001 --> 00:05:36.127
(Chuckling) Okay.

00:05:36.211 --> 00:05:37.462
Andre: You wanna play belote?

00:05:37.546 --> 00:05:39.106
Adult Dwayne: And
it wasn't just my dad.

00:05:39.172 --> 00:05:41.424
I was surrounded by people
working the gimmick.

00:05:41.508 --> 00:05:43.760
I worked a match in Detroit
with playboy Bobby riggs.

00:05:43.844 --> 00:05:46.304
Ton of talent, man.
Terrible body.

00:05:46.388 --> 00:05:47.848
He looked like a loaf
of bread, huh?

00:05:47.931 --> 00:05:50.225
Bobby riggs is funny guy.
Like the Burt Reynolds.

00:05:50.308 --> 00:05:51.768
No, he's gotta work the gimmick.

00:05:51.852 --> 00:05:55.939
Wild Samoans, andré the giant,
"soulman" rocky Johnson.

00:05:56.022 --> 00:05:57.862
You can have all the skill
of the world, right?

00:05:57.899 --> 00:05:59.335
But if the audience
don't buy your look...

00:05:59.359 --> 00:06:00.610
You'll never get over.

00:06:00.694 --> 00:06:02.904
His beige trunks aren't
doing him any favors.

00:06:02.988 --> 00:06:04.197
(All laugh)

00:06:04.281 --> 00:06:06.449
How's your girlfriend
doing? Not so great.

00:06:07.033 --> 00:06:08.410
She stabbed me. (Gasps)

00:06:08.493 --> 00:06:10.328
I've come along way
from when Peter...

00:06:11.204 --> 00:06:12.455
Miss you, Peter.

00:06:12.539 --> 00:06:13.623
Love you, high chief...

00:06:13.707 --> 00:06:15.917
From when he first
took me to his matches.

00:06:16.001 --> 00:06:18.128
I thought he was
really getting hurt.

00:06:18.211 --> 00:06:19.254
Aah!

00:06:19.337 --> 00:06:20.338
(Yelling)

00:06:20.422 --> 00:06:22.173
Peter: Lia, no,
Lia, no, no, Lia!

00:06:22.257 --> 00:06:24.467
(Laughs)
I bet the crowd loved it.

00:06:24.551 --> 00:06:25.844
Now that's a shoot. (Laughter)

00:06:25.927 --> 00:06:27.864
Young Dwayne: I don't get why
there's so many rules.

00:06:27.888 --> 00:06:29.556
It's all fake anyway.

00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:30.765
(Chatter stops)

00:06:34.436 --> 00:06:35.437
What happened?

00:06:36.813 --> 00:06:38.982
(Thudding footsteps)

00:06:43.111 --> 00:06:46.406
(Wind blowing)

00:06:49.618 --> 00:06:50.827
(Heartbeat thudding)

00:06:55.916 --> 00:06:57.083
Does this fee! Fake?

00:06:58.251 --> 00:06:59.336
Then it's not fake.

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:01.588
You never use the f word.

00:07:02.005 --> 00:07:04.049
Comprends? Yes.

00:07:04.132 --> 00:07:05.216
Good.

00:07:06.051 --> 00:07:08.011
(Laughs) Now we hug.

00:07:08.094 --> 00:07:09.220
Huh? (Young Dwayne grunts)

00:07:10.555 --> 00:07:11.657
I did not raise him like that.

00:07:11.681 --> 00:07:13.034
Junkyard dog: That's
your boy. Rocky: I'm so sorry.

00:07:13.058 --> 00:07:14.351
Junkyard dog: Your move.

00:07:15.101 --> 00:07:16.102
Young ata: Let's go.

00:07:16.561 --> 00:07:18.271
(Indistinct chatter)

00:07:18.897 --> 00:07:20.106
Slight change of plan.

00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:21.983
I'm gonna go grab drinks
with the guys.

00:07:22.525 --> 00:07:23.836
I knew we shouldn't
have stopped here.

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:25.236
It's just andré's thinking

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:26.589
about investing
in this tiki bar,

00:07:26.613 --> 00:07:27.948
and he wants us to check it out.

00:07:28.031 --> 00:07:29.842
I want you all to be honest with me.
Junkyard dog: I'MMA be honest.

00:07:29.866 --> 00:07:32.011
You promised Dewey you'd
take him for ice cream, rocky.

00:07:32.035 --> 00:07:33.036
Dewey will be fine.

00:07:33.787 --> 00:07:34.788
Hey, Dewey.

00:07:36.748 --> 00:07:38.267
Daddy's got to go take care
of some business

00:07:38.291 --> 00:07:39.793
with Andre and the guys.

00:07:39.876 --> 00:07:41.604
So we're gonna have to
rain check on that ice cream.

00:07:41.628 --> 00:07:42.796
Can I go with you?

00:07:42.879 --> 00:07:44.547
I'm sorry, buddy.
It's adult stuff.

00:07:45.131 --> 00:07:48.176
But, hey, ice cream
for breakfast tomorrow.

00:07:49.469 --> 00:07:50.553
I'll see you later.

00:07:51.137 --> 00:07:52.555
Iloveyou. Loveyoutoo.

00:07:53.139 --> 00:07:55.308
(Chuckles) Bye, bye.

00:07:56.393 --> 00:07:57.560
(Indistinct chatter)

00:07:57.644 --> 00:08:00.355
Hey, come on. Let's go.
You ready to go?

00:08:00.438 --> 00:08:03.608
Mom, why doesn't dad
let me do anything with him?

00:08:07.028 --> 00:08:08.029
(Chuckles)

00:08:09.072 --> 00:08:10.240
Can you keep a secret?

00:08:10.907 --> 00:08:13.410
I told your dad
I wouldn't tell you, but...

00:08:13.493 --> 00:08:15.745
The president
called earlier today.

00:08:15.829 --> 00:08:18.748
Now, he can't talk about it
or give any details,

00:08:18.832 --> 00:08:21.376
but it's big,
and no one can know.

00:08:22.168 --> 00:08:23.795
Like in shogun warriors?

00:08:24.963 --> 00:08:25.964
Mm-hmm.

00:08:26.047 --> 00:08:28.258
Whoa. Does grandma know?

00:08:29.509 --> 00:08:32.929
So let's not mention anything
when we go for ice cream, okay?

00:08:33.013 --> 00:08:35.015
Okay. Good boy,
go get your shoes.

00:08:35.515 --> 00:08:38.268
Grandma, we're going
for ice cream!

00:08:38.351 --> 00:08:41.104
Adult Dwayne: So, even though
my dad clearly had flaws,

00:08:41.187 --> 00:08:43.773
when I was that little boy,
he was still my hero.

00:08:44.607 --> 00:08:46.377
Well, it seems like
your mom helped with that.

00:08:46.401 --> 00:08:49.362
In her own way, she was working
the gimmick too, but for your benefit.

00:08:49.446 --> 00:08:52.073
That's right. Working the
gimmick was how my family lived,

00:08:52.157 --> 00:08:53.366
and we all embraced it.

00:08:53.450 --> 00:08:55.290
As a matter of fact,
it was working the gimmick

00:08:55.368 --> 00:08:56.911
that eventually led
to me stealing.

00:08:56.995 --> 00:08:58.663
Man: Stop! Can we stop?

00:08:58.747 --> 00:09:00.641
I don't know if we should
be going down this road.

00:09:00.665 --> 00:09:02.000
Adult Dwayne: It's okay, Sandy.

00:09:02.083 --> 00:09:04.395
And I told you I was gonna get
very real with this thing, Randall.

00:09:04.419 --> 00:09:06.421
Yeah, Sandy. Oh, my god.

00:09:06.504 --> 00:09:08.131
Okay, can we
lock the set down, please?

00:09:08.214 --> 00:09:09.340
(Laughs)

00:09:10.425 --> 00:09:11.527
Adult Dwayne:
So I'm gonna get real,

00:09:11.551 --> 00:09:12.886
and the real is

00:09:13.386 --> 00:09:14.471
working the gimmick

00:09:14.554 --> 00:09:16.890
led to me doing some
pretty bad... (Bleeps).

00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:19.517
I'm sorry, Randall,
can I say that?

00:09:19.601 --> 00:09:21.686
It's not very presidential,
but (bleeps) It.

00:09:21.770 --> 00:09:22.896
(Bothlaugh)

00:09:22.979 --> 00:09:24.022
That's my guy.

00:09:24.105 --> 00:09:27.025
You know, back then, I wanted
people to see me in a certain way,

00:09:27.108 --> 00:09:29.152
and I did whatever had to
to make that happen.

00:09:29.235 --> 00:09:31.654
(Upbeat music playing)

00:09:34.407 --> 00:09:36.367
Hit it

00:09:36.451 --> 00:09:39.287
ooh, baby, baby

00:09:39.370 --> 00:09:40.514
need any help finding anything?

00:09:40.538 --> 00:09:42.165
Nah, nothing's really
catching my eye.

00:09:42.248 --> 00:09:43.416
Thanks, though.

00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:45.126
(Upbeat music continues)

00:09:45.210 --> 00:09:48.046
Adult Dwayne: Was it wrong?
Yeah, it was wrong.

00:09:48.129 --> 00:09:49.398
But, honestly,
who among us hasn't done

00:09:49.422 --> 00:09:50.840
a little five-finger boost, huh?

00:09:50.924 --> 00:09:53.176
Right.
Or a little credit card fraud.

00:09:56.054 --> 00:09:57.597
Ow! Baby

00:10:00.850 --> 00:10:02.268
salt-n-pepa's here

00:10:03.353 --> 00:10:05.897
salt, salt, salt,
salt-n-pepa's here

00:10:06.689 --> 00:10:09.859
salt, salt, salt, salt,
salt, salt-n-pepa's here

00:10:13.822 --> 00:10:15.031
you must be rich.

00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:17.534
(Scoffs) Yeah.

00:10:20.161 --> 00:10:21.454
What's your name again?

00:10:22.747 --> 00:10:23.748
Tomas.

00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:27.085
P-Push it real good

00:10:27.544 --> 00:10:30.130
Tomas? Why'd you say
your name was Tomas?

00:10:30.213 --> 00:10:32.132
'Cause it sounds way cooler
than Dwayne.

00:10:32.215 --> 00:10:34.175
Look, new school, new name.

00:10:34.259 --> 00:10:35.718
And now that I look rich,

00:10:35.802 --> 00:10:37.595
I'm finally getting attention
from girls,

00:10:37.679 --> 00:10:39.389
like Karen, from algebra.

00:10:39.472 --> 00:10:40.473
Big hair Karen?

00:10:40.932 --> 00:10:42.225
Fine-ass Karen

00:10:42.767 --> 00:10:44.161
the one who front-knots
her pe shirt.

00:10:44.185 --> 00:10:45.186
Oh!

00:10:47.355 --> 00:10:48.958
I couldn't get the security
tag thing off,

00:10:48.982 --> 00:10:51.568
so I banged it with a rock,
and all this ink exploded out.

00:10:51.651 --> 00:10:53.571
Just tell people you spilled
your blueberry wine.

00:10:54.070 --> 00:10:55.071
Hmm.

00:10:55.155 --> 00:10:56.322
Anyway.

00:10:56.406 --> 00:10:59.576
The best part is Karen
invited me to a party tonight.

00:10:59.659 --> 00:11:00.785
So life is good, huh?

00:11:00.869 --> 00:11:01.911
It is.

00:11:01.995 --> 00:11:03.121
Well, it's not gonna last.

00:11:03.204 --> 00:11:04.497
Fine-ass Karen aside,

00:11:04.581 --> 00:11:06.892
the reason why these girls haven't
been giving you the time of day

00:11:06.916 --> 00:11:08.001
isn't 'cause you look poor.

00:11:08.626 --> 00:11:10.306
It's 'cause you look like
a undercover cop.

00:11:10.753 --> 00:11:12.148
Like Johnny Depp
from 21 jump street.

00:11:12.172 --> 00:11:13.423
No one thinks that.

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:16.176
Dwayne, everyone thinks that.

00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:19.304
(Whispering) He's looking at me.

00:11:19.387 --> 00:11:21.264
He's a cop, like Johnny Depp.

00:11:21.598 --> 00:11:22.682
I'm 15!

00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:26.311
You have a full mustache,
and you're bigger than a dad.

00:11:26.394 --> 00:11:28.154
You look like you work
at a auto parts store.

00:11:28.188 --> 00:11:29.522
Whatever, man.

00:11:29.606 --> 00:11:31.900
None of that matters now
that I got a girl into me.

00:11:31.983 --> 00:11:34.819
Yeah, but that girl thinks
you're rich, and you're not.

00:11:35.528 --> 00:11:37.572
And you ain't fooling anybody
riding the bus.

00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:53.963
Hey, baby. How was school?

00:11:54.047 --> 00:11:55.632
When is dad getting back
with the car?

00:11:56.382 --> 00:11:58.176
When the wrestling convention
is over.

00:11:58.259 --> 00:12:00.678
He's getting paid to sign
autographs. We could use the money.

00:12:00.762 --> 00:12:02.180
We could also use the car.

00:12:02.263 --> 00:12:03.973
I'm boxing pizzas aflerschool

00:12:04.057 --> 00:12:06.100
you're cleaning houses,
like, five towns away,

00:12:06.184 --> 00:12:07.464
and we both
have to take the bus.

00:12:07.518 --> 00:12:08.853
What's wrong
with taking the bus?

00:12:08.937 --> 00:12:10.372
There was a man
sitting across from me

00:12:10.396 --> 00:12:12.607
playing the flute yesterday.
It was beautiful.

00:12:13.316 --> 00:12:15.044
Karen will think I'm poor
if she sees me riding the bus.

00:12:15.068 --> 00:12:16.319
Who's Karen?

00:12:16.402 --> 00:12:17.737
Can't we just get another car?

00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:19.781
Look, I got some money saved.
I can get us one.

00:12:19.864 --> 00:12:21.032
How much money?

00:12:21.532 --> 00:12:22.533
$103.

00:12:22.617 --> 00:12:24.911
Dewey, you won't be able
to get a car for that.

00:12:24.994 --> 00:12:26.996
But you know what you could do?

00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:28.539
Borrow the other
16,000 from you?

00:12:30.291 --> 00:12:32.001
You could help us
with groceries and bills.

00:12:32.085 --> 00:12:33.485
Karen doesn't care
about that stuff.

00:12:33.544 --> 00:12:34.545
Who's Karen?

00:12:34.629 --> 00:12:35.964
She's a pretty girl I like.

00:12:36.047 --> 00:12:37.173
That's what you care about?

00:12:37.257 --> 00:12:38.841
Your priorities
are out of whack, Dewey.

00:12:39.384 --> 00:12:42.136
Fine. Can you at least cosign
on a credit card for me?

00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:43.489
I mean, it doesn't even
have to be a good one.

00:12:43.513 --> 00:12:45.473
It can be from
strawbridge &amp; clothier.

00:12:45.807 --> 00:12:47.141
(Groans)

00:12:48.768 --> 00:12:50.061
Young Dwayne:
I'm desperate, man.

00:12:50.144 --> 00:12:51.729
I've called
every ad in the paper.

00:12:51.813 --> 00:12:53.648
Nobody's selling their car
for a 103 bucks.

00:12:53.731 --> 00:12:55.316
Dude, you're not
bargaining right.

00:12:55.608 --> 00:12:58.486
You gotta start at a dollar
and then meet in the middle.

00:12:59.153 --> 00:13:00.321
Man: Need a car?

00:13:02.907 --> 00:13:04.284
I got a car for sale, dude.

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:08.371
Well... (Sighs) Here she is.

00:13:10.164 --> 00:13:11.416
I'll give you a dollar for it.

00:13:12.417 --> 00:13:15.336
Come on, man. I overheard
you say you had $103.

00:13:15.420 --> 00:13:16.546
I'll take that.

00:13:16.629 --> 00:13:17.630
Deal.

00:13:18.631 --> 00:13:20.049
Congrats, kid.

00:13:20.550 --> 00:13:23.803
Oh, you're gonna want
to wash that key.

00:13:26.014 --> 00:13:27.682
(Engine rattling)

00:13:30.518 --> 00:13:32.186
Young Dwayne: Man,
this ride is smooth.

00:13:32.270 --> 00:13:33.313
Dude, yeah.

00:13:33.396 --> 00:13:35.106
I'm just trying to get us
some tunes here.

00:13:35.189 --> 00:13:36.858
This radio
only pulls one station.

00:13:36.941 --> 00:13:39.152
Who cares? Blast it.

00:13:39.235 --> 00:13:41.237
(Opera music playing
over speakers)

00:13:51.247 --> 00:13:52.457
What's up?

00:13:53.875 --> 00:13:55.752
What are those? Chips?

00:13:56.252 --> 00:13:57.337
Hey, yep.

00:13:58.296 --> 00:13:59.339
(Music stops)

00:13:59.422 --> 00:14:01.674
So, what's our plan for tonight?

00:14:01.758 --> 00:14:04.218
Grab some beers and hit
that westside party

00:14:04.302 --> 00:14:05.345
Karen invited me to.

00:14:05.428 --> 00:14:07.472
Okay.
Every place around here ids.

00:14:07.555 --> 00:14:08.973
How are we gonna get beers?

00:14:09.057 --> 00:14:10.576
I guess we could hit that
one store in the next county

00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:11.934
where the dude is blind.

00:14:12.018 --> 00:14:13.162
Where are we heading?
Both: Whoa!

00:14:13.186 --> 00:14:14.580
Stop the car, stop the car,
stop the car!

00:14:14.604 --> 00:14:16.856
Go, go, go, go, go! Oh, my god.

00:14:16.939 --> 00:14:18.024
Who the hell are you?

00:14:18.107 --> 00:14:20.151
I'm waffle. Where's Billy?

00:14:20.234 --> 00:14:21.527
Billy sold my boy this car.

00:14:21.611 --> 00:14:24.614
(Chuckles) Billy is always
selling things waffle is in.

00:14:24.697 --> 00:14:27.075
I'm sure that's true now,
can you get out of the car?

00:14:27.158 --> 00:14:28.993
Allow me to present
a second option.

00:14:29.077 --> 00:14:30.995
Heard you're going to a party
on the West Side.

00:14:31.079 --> 00:14:32.431
What if you let me
hitch a ride with you?

00:14:32.455 --> 00:14:34.499
My buddy Bernard's townhouse
is right there.

00:14:34.582 --> 00:14:36.042
No way. Get out.

00:14:37.210 --> 00:14:39.837
I also heard you say
you needed to buy some beer.

00:14:40.546 --> 00:14:42.548
(Funky music playing)

00:14:44.675 --> 00:14:46.677
(Upbeat rap music playing)

00:14:54.852 --> 00:14:56.852
D, I've got to find the can.
I'll see you in there.

00:14:59.607 --> 00:15:01.401
Didn't even say goodbye.

00:15:04.362 --> 00:15:06.280
(Groaning)
Young Dwayne: What the...

00:15:06.364 --> 00:15:07.407
Waffle?

00:15:07.490 --> 00:15:08.574
Hoody.

00:15:08.658 --> 00:15:09.742
(Groaning)

00:15:12.036 --> 00:15:13.037
He's a good guy.

00:15:17.667 --> 00:15:20.461
Five-finger boost, huh?
You know, you remind me of me.

00:15:21.421 --> 00:15:22.713
No offense, waffle,

00:15:22.797 --> 00:15:24.424
but me and you are not the same.

00:15:24.507 --> 00:15:26.300
I was once a poor kid

00:15:26.384 --> 00:15:28.094
trying to impress people
that don't matter.

00:15:28.386 --> 00:15:29.804
You gotta see this girl.

00:15:29.887 --> 00:15:31.681
Trust me. She matters.

00:15:31.764 --> 00:15:34.308
I promise you, in ten years,
she won't.

00:15:34.392 --> 00:15:36.978
The only things that
really matter are your family,

00:15:37.061 --> 00:15:38.062
your integrity,

00:15:38.146 --> 00:15:40.523
and freezing your eggs
ifyou're a lady.

00:15:40.815 --> 00:15:42.400
That's real bleak, waffle.

00:15:42.483 --> 00:15:44.318
It's not bleak.
It's about priorities.

00:15:45.736 --> 00:15:47.363
If I could do it all over again,

00:15:47.447 --> 00:15:49.407
I would have cared more
about the people

00:15:49.490 --> 00:15:51.909
who, you know, cared about me.

00:15:53.703 --> 00:15:56.038
(Car engine sputtering)

00:15:58.624 --> 00:15:59.876
(Brakes squeak)

00:15:59.959 --> 00:16:01.479
Need a ride?
(Indistinct radio program)

00:16:01.752 --> 00:16:03.629
Dewey? Get in.

00:16:03.713 --> 00:16:04.839
I'll explain.

00:16:10.636 --> 00:16:12.513
Hey, mama. I'm waffle.

00:16:13.222 --> 00:16:14.682
Hello, waffle.

00:16:14.765 --> 00:16:15.933
Whose car is this?

00:16:16.017 --> 00:16:17.185
It's ours.

00:16:17.268 --> 00:16:20.605
Mine and yours.
Look what $103 can buy.

00:16:20.688 --> 00:16:22.690
(Engine spluttering)

00:16:22.773 --> 00:16:25.860
It has seat belts, a hole
where a cigarette lighter was.

00:16:25.943 --> 00:16:27.278
It gets the news.

00:16:27.361 --> 00:16:28.654
You love the news.

00:16:28.738 --> 00:16:29.947
(Laughs)

00:16:30.364 --> 00:16:31.949
I'm sorry about earlier.

00:16:32.575 --> 00:16:34.368
I'm glad you got
the car you needed.

00:16:34.452 --> 00:16:36.287
Look, there's a lot of
things that we need,

00:16:36.913 --> 00:16:38.393
and I'm gonna start
helping with that.

00:16:41.083 --> 00:16:42.203
But I promise you one thing.

00:16:42.877 --> 00:16:44.545
One day, I'm gonna
get you a Cadillac.

00:16:44.629 --> 00:16:46.797
A red one? You know
my favorite color is red.

00:16:47.340 --> 00:16:49.800
All the colors. Look, one
for every day of the week.

00:16:49.884 --> 00:16:50.927
Or seven red ones.

00:16:51.219 --> 00:16:52.595
Or seven red ones.

00:16:52.678 --> 00:16:54.472
(Waffle laughs)

00:16:55.389 --> 00:16:57.350
Oh, seven red ones.

00:17:00.228 --> 00:17:01.395
(Car door closes) Ata: Bye.

00:17:01.479 --> 00:17:02.939
Waffle: Bye, mama!

00:17:03.439 --> 00:17:05.441
Hey, man, I appreciate
that advice you gave me.

00:17:05.525 --> 00:17:06.651
Hey, no problem, kid.

00:17:06.734 --> 00:17:09.111
I can tell how much you
and your mom love each other.

00:17:09.195 --> 00:17:10.964
I know you're gonna give her
all those things one day.

00:17:10.988 --> 00:17:11.989
I mean, I hope so.

00:17:12.073 --> 00:17:14.075
No, no, no. You will. (Laughs)

00:17:14.158 --> 00:17:15.243
(Chuckles)

00:17:15.326 --> 00:17:16.911
As long as you keep doing
one thing.

00:17:18.162 --> 00:17:19.956
All you got to do is...

00:17:21.582 --> 00:17:22.959
(Groaning)

00:17:25.169 --> 00:17:26.504
(Groaning stops)

00:17:26.587 --> 00:17:28.256
All I got to do is what?

00:17:28.339 --> 00:17:31.175
Yo, waffle? Waf...

00:17:31.259 --> 00:17:33.135
Uh, yeah, there's a
dead guy named waffle

00:17:33.219 --> 00:17:34.345
in a random thunderbird

00:17:34.428 --> 00:17:35.748
that's officially owned
by nobody.

00:17:35.805 --> 00:17:37.598
Yeah, my name is mayor mccheese.

00:17:42.228 --> 00:17:44.981
Gosh, iwasn't expecting
to care about waffle so much.

00:17:45.606 --> 00:17:46.816
Adult Dwayne: I know, right?

00:17:46.899 --> 00:17:48.085
Every time
I pass a waffle house,

00:17:48.109 --> 00:17:49.909
I always kiss my fingers
and point to the sky.

00:17:50.653 --> 00:17:51.737
That's for you, waffle.

00:17:51.821 --> 00:17:53.698
And you kept the promise
you made to your mom.

00:17:53.781 --> 00:17:56.701
I believe we have a picture of
one of the cars you gave her?

00:17:56.784 --> 00:17:57.928
(Adult Dwayne laughs) Mama rock.

00:17:57.952 --> 00:17:59.996
She just loves her red caddies.

00:18:00.079 --> 00:18:01.289
I need to call my mom.

00:18:01.706 --> 00:18:03.124
Last time I talked to her was...

00:18:04.875 --> 00:18:05.918
Thirty years ago.

00:18:06.002 --> 00:18:07.086
Yeah. Oh, wow.

00:18:07.878 --> 00:18:09.213
(Fireplace crackling)

00:18:10.923 --> 00:18:12.675
Now, was it at this point
in your life

00:18:12.758 --> 00:18:14.844
when you decided to stop
working the gimmick?

00:18:14.927 --> 00:18:17.513
The truth is, I've never
stopped working the gimmick.

00:18:17.597 --> 00:18:20.641
I've just learned to make
the gimmick work for me.

00:18:20.725 --> 00:18:23.394
I started figuring it out when I
got to the university of Miami.

00:18:23.477 --> 00:18:25.237
Oh, you were there on
a football scholarship.

00:18:25.313 --> 00:18:27.082
A five-star recruit
coming out of high school.

00:18:27.106 --> 00:18:28.691
And I was fired up... (Sighs)

00:18:28.774 --> 00:18:32.820
Because in 1990, the u
wasn't just a football team.

00:18:33.404 --> 00:18:34.864
We were a movement.

00:18:35.615 --> 00:18:36.699
Three national titles

00:18:36.782 --> 00:18:38.622
under three different
head coaches in the '80s.

00:18:38.701 --> 00:18:41.704
An Incubator for future stars.
(Chuckles)

00:18:42.163 --> 00:18:43.914
You know the 'canes
became legends

00:18:43.998 --> 00:18:47.710
for the joy they played with and,
of course, that swagger, baby.

00:18:47.793 --> 00:18:50.129
Coolin' in Miami one summer day

00:18:50.212 --> 00:18:52.548
driving down the streets
along the bay

00:18:52.632 --> 00:18:55.343
adult Dwayne: When I got
to Miami, I just wanted to fit in.

00:18:55.426 --> 00:18:58.304
I had no intention
of working the gimmick.

00:18:58.387 --> 00:19:00.640
I was just gonna keep
my head down and grind.

00:19:02.350 --> 00:19:04.352
(Song continues)

00:19:08.356 --> 00:19:11.317
There he is.
The beast of Bethlehem.

00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:12.568
What up, coach orgeron?

00:19:12.652 --> 00:19:15.071
How the hell are you, son?
Welcome to Miami football.

00:19:15.154 --> 00:19:16.364
Hey, you want some coffee?

00:19:16.447 --> 00:19:17.782
No, thanks.
I don't drink coffee.

00:19:17.865 --> 00:19:19.575
Oh, me neither. I chew it.

00:19:19.659 --> 00:19:21.410
Sends it straight to the blood.

00:19:21.494 --> 00:19:23.621
All right, first d-line
meeting's at noon.

00:19:23.704 --> 00:19:24.705
Yes, sir.

00:19:25.665 --> 00:19:26.874
Man: Yo, what's up man?

00:19:27.833 --> 00:19:29.633
Jessie armstead,
besthnebacker in the country.

00:19:29.710 --> 00:19:32.588
Hey. Russell Maryland,
young d-line legend.

00:19:32.672 --> 00:19:34.757
Dwayne Johnson,
beast of Bethlehem.

00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:37.176
Also known as hitzilla,
Edward blitzerhands,

00:19:37.259 --> 00:19:39.261
and the chairman
of Goldman "sacks"

00:19:39.345 --> 00:19:40.680
hmm, yeah, we know.

00:19:40.763 --> 00:19:42.563
Your dad was here an hour ago
bragging on you.

00:19:42.973 --> 00:19:44.016
My dad was here?

00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:46.370
Yeah, rocky Johnson. I used
to watch him when I was a kid.

00:19:46.394 --> 00:19:48.396
I even got his autograph.
Check it out.

00:19:49.188 --> 00:19:50.189
(Chuckles)

00:19:50.272 --> 00:19:52.632
Congrats, man. He said you was
gonna be on the wheaties box.

00:19:53.484 --> 00:19:55.611
What? Some next
generation athlete-type thing.

00:19:55.695 --> 00:19:56.838
When's it hitting the shelves?

00:19:56.862 --> 00:20:00.032
Uh, you know, we did that
for wheaties Asia,

00:20:00.116 --> 00:20:02.118
so it's not
coming out in the states.

00:20:02.201 --> 00:20:04.286
Even better. I've got some
family out in Singapore.

00:20:04.370 --> 00:20:06.490
Maybe they can peep it.
Oh, no. See, that's the thing.

00:20:06.539 --> 00:20:09.500
That's south Asia, and it's
coming out in north Asia.

00:20:11.836 --> 00:20:13.713
You're lying to the wrong
geography buffs.

00:20:13.796 --> 00:20:16.799
Yeah, wait till my uncle
in Singapore hear about this.

00:20:16.882 --> 00:20:19.218
(Scoffs) Freshmen, man.

00:20:19.301 --> 00:20:20.720
Dad, you were here this morning?

00:20:20.803 --> 00:20:21.988
Rocky: Drove all the
way from tampa

00:20:22.012 --> 00:20:23.156
to be there when the gym opened.

00:20:23.180 --> 00:20:25.683
I go outta my way
to set my son up for success.

00:20:25.766 --> 00:20:27.246
Yeah, but you didn't even
come see me.

00:20:27.309 --> 00:20:29.103
That would have spoiled
the surprise.

00:20:29.186 --> 00:20:30.312
Young Dwayne: What surprise?

00:20:30.396 --> 00:20:32.523
I put you over with the guys.

00:20:32.606 --> 00:20:33.917
It was your first day
in the program,

00:20:33.941 --> 00:20:35.252
and I wanted
to make you look good.

00:20:35.276 --> 00:20:37.445
What, by telling them I was
gonna be on a wheaties box?

00:20:37.528 --> 00:20:38.946
Surprise!

00:20:39.029 --> 00:20:40.781
(Laughs) You're
surprised, ain't you?

00:20:40.865 --> 00:20:42.116
No, I'm not surprised.

00:20:42.199 --> 00:20:43.927
I had to cover and tell 'em
it was for wheaties Asia.

00:20:43.951 --> 00:20:45.494
Wheaties Asia? No.

00:20:45.578 --> 00:20:46.829
No, son. You're messing it up.

00:20:46.912 --> 00:20:49.123
Look, all you gotta
do is work the gimmick.

00:20:49.206 --> 00:20:50.267
There is no gimmick to work.

00:20:50.291 --> 00:20:52.209
I'm not gonna be
on a wheaties box.

00:20:52.293 --> 00:20:54.128
But they don't know that.

00:20:54.211 --> 00:20:55.212
(Phone clicks) Hello?

00:20:55.921 --> 00:20:58.174
Hey, champ, truck's loaded
up and all ready for delivery.

00:20:58.257 --> 00:20:59.341
You got it, boss.

00:20:59.425 --> 00:21:00.968
I'm just on the phone
with my kid.

00:21:02.136 --> 00:21:03.179
All right, son.

00:21:03.262 --> 00:21:05.055
Father's gotta go back to work.

00:21:05.139 --> 00:21:06.348
(Laughs)

00:21:06.432 --> 00:21:08.726
Oh, no, no, no, no.
I'm not the best.

00:21:08.809 --> 00:21:10.186
God's the best.

00:21:10.269 --> 00:21:11.645
(Chuckles)

00:21:16.192 --> 00:21:17.526
(Truck reverse beeping)

00:21:24.283 --> 00:21:25.868
All aboard!

00:21:25.951 --> 00:21:27.077
(Laughter)

00:21:30.664 --> 00:21:32.666
(Rock music playing)

00:21:58.859 --> 00:22:00.152
Kid's knocking those out.

00:22:00.236 --> 00:22:01.737
Man: Yeah. What's he on?

00:22:02.363 --> 00:22:05.074
Twenty. Okay, okay.

00:22:06.826 --> 00:22:09.119
All: Twenty-five, 26,

00:22:09.203 --> 00:22:11.455
twenty-seven, 28,

00:22:11.539 --> 00:22:13.457
twenty-nine, 30...

00:22:13.541 --> 00:22:15.084
All: Come on, come on.

00:22:15.167 --> 00:22:16.585
All: Thirty-one...

00:22:16.669 --> 00:22:17.837
All right, come in, come in!

00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:20.714
Thirty-two, 33...

00:22:22.049 --> 00:22:23.843
All: Thirty-four!

00:22:25.261 --> 00:22:27.054
Thirty-five!

00:22:31.851 --> 00:22:33.978
Thirty-six! Yeah!

00:22:34.061 --> 00:22:35.229
(All cheering)

00:22:38.232 --> 00:22:40.150
Damn. Your dad wasn't lying.

00:22:40.818 --> 00:22:43.737
You better eat
your wheaties, Asia.

00:22:43.821 --> 00:22:45.698
(Laughter)

00:22:45.781 --> 00:22:49.910
That's when I found my
version of working the gimmick.

00:22:50.619 --> 00:22:53.289
Be me, but with the dial
turned up to 11.

00:22:53.372 --> 00:22:54.707
(Chuckles) So that's who I was

00:22:54.790 --> 00:22:56.625
every time I flashed
the people's eyebrow.

00:22:57.251 --> 00:22:58.728
That's who I was
when I threw ludacris

00:22:58.752 --> 00:23:00.379
off a bridge in Jumanji 5

00:23:00.462 --> 00:23:01.547
and that's who I was

00:23:01.630 --> 00:23:04.383
when I played gene Simmons
in that kiss biopic.

00:23:04.466 --> 00:23:05.801
But, Dwayne, I have to ask,

00:23:05.885 --> 00:23:08.512
wouldn't it have been easier
to just tell your teammates

00:23:08.596 --> 00:23:10.931
that your dad made that whole
wheaties thing up?

00:23:11.015 --> 00:23:12.325
Yeah, of course it would
have been easier,

00:23:12.349 --> 00:23:14.643
but I couldn't do that,
Randall. That's my dad.

00:23:15.185 --> 00:23:17.021
The truth is, in his way,

00:23:17.104 --> 00:23:19.064
he pushed me to do things
I never would have done.

00:23:20.232 --> 00:23:21.710
Well, can you give us
some more details?

00:23:21.734 --> 00:23:24.278
Like, how did you get
from Hawaii to Pennsylvania?

00:23:24.361 --> 00:23:26.530
Did you ever know waffles'
last name?

00:23:26.614 --> 00:23:28.532
When did you start
playing football?

00:23:28.616 --> 00:23:29.968
I'm gonna tell you
all of that, Randall,

00:23:29.992 --> 00:23:31.702
and much more.

00:23:31.785 --> 00:23:34.306
And, look, once people hear these
stories about my life and my family,

00:23:34.330 --> 00:23:37.499
they're gonna see how much
we actually all have in common.

00:23:38.042 --> 00:23:39.543
I can't wait. That's right.

00:23:39.627 --> 00:23:41.503
Oh, and I've got
some pretty cool stories

00:23:41.587 --> 00:23:42.796
about andré the giant.

00:23:43.881 --> 00:23:45.041
Man: That's a great question.

00:23:45.090 --> 00:23:46.800
And so, yes, the dalmatians...

00:23:46.884 --> 00:23:48.093
(All screaming)

00:23:48.177 --> 00:23:50.220
Andre: Hey! Bonjour, babies.

00:23:51.430 --> 00:23:53.098
Let me tell you my career, huh?

00:23:53.724 --> 00:23:55.142
What are you looking at?

00:23:55.225 --> 00:23:56.936
(Children giggling)
