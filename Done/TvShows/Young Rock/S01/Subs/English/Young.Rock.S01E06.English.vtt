WEBVTT

00:00:04.963 --> 00:00:07.216
(Cameras shutters clicking)
(People talking indistinctly)

00:00:07.299 --> 00:00:09.301
Good morning, everyone.
Good to see everybody.

00:00:09.384 --> 00:00:13.263
I am excited to formally announce
my choice of running mate.

00:00:13.555 --> 00:00:14.932
The person who I have chosen

00:00:15.015 --> 00:00:17.643
to become our next vice
president of the United States

00:00:18.894 --> 00:00:20.562
is general Monica Jackson.

00:00:20.646 --> 00:00:22.439
(Crowd gasps and chatters)

00:00:22.523 --> 00:00:24.876
Male reporter 1: Miss Jackson, quick
question. Male reporter 2: Miss Jackson.

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.068
Who?

00:00:26.151 --> 00:00:27.194
(Camera shutters clicking)

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.404
Thank you.

00:00:33.992 --> 00:00:35.661
Not very good
at public speaking.

00:00:35.744 --> 00:00:37.788
(Crowd clamoring)

00:00:37.913 --> 00:00:40.791
But general Jackson endorsed
your opponent, senator taft.

00:00:40.874 --> 00:00:42.167
That's right, she did.

00:00:42.251 --> 00:00:43.627
And general Jackson and I

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.796
have had many differences
of opinion in the past.

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:47.589
She said your remake of Matilda

00:00:47.673 --> 00:00:49.174
lacked the necessary violence

00:00:49.258 --> 00:00:50.259
to be entertaining.

00:00:50.342 --> 00:00:51.402
And that was not one of them.

00:00:51.426 --> 00:00:53.466
I completely agree with
general Jackson on that one.

00:00:54.137 --> 00:00:55.472
(Chuckles)

00:00:55.556 --> 00:00:57.182
Guys. Guys, listen.

00:00:57.266 --> 00:00:59.685
I understand that
this choice today

00:00:59.768 --> 00:01:01.728
is one that may surprise
alotofyou,

00:01:01.812 --> 00:01:03.021
but, growing up the way I did,

00:01:03.105 --> 00:01:05.649
I learned to really value
unique people

00:01:05.732 --> 00:01:07.526
with wildly different
points of view.

00:01:07.651 --> 00:01:09.361
So let me just take a moment,

00:01:09.444 --> 00:01:11.446
and take you back
to when I was 10 years old,

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:12.864
living in Hawaii.

00:01:12.948 --> 00:01:15.325
"Instant classic,
stunning puppetry."

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:17.953
You hear that, mom?
The puppetry is stunning.

00:01:18.036 --> 00:01:20.163
Ugh, what is it
with that ugly thing?

00:01:20.247 --> 00:01:22.374
He's everywhere.
Young Dwayne: He's e.T.

00:01:22.457 --> 00:01:24.167
He eats candy
and uses the telephone.

00:01:24.251 --> 00:01:26.670
I have to see it. That's e.T.?

00:01:26.753 --> 00:01:28.815
Looks like the guy who sells
mangoes next to the highway.

00:01:28.839 --> 00:01:29.840
It's the eyes.

00:01:30.424 --> 00:01:32.467
Mom, can we see e. T.?

00:01:32.551 --> 00:01:34.886
Please? Sorry, baby, not today.

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:37.222
I'm recording my audition song
for star search.

00:01:37.306 --> 00:01:38.557
That's right, you are!

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.017
God, they're gonna
love your voice.

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.185
What are you singing?
Laura branigan.

00:01:44.062 --> 00:01:45.355
She sings Gloria.

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:46.940
It's the hottest song
of the summer.

00:01:47.024 --> 00:01:48.609
It's gonna be great,
trust me. Okay.

00:01:48.692 --> 00:01:50.611
Mom, I don't mean
to not be supportive here...

00:01:50.694 --> 00:01:52.112
How 'bout we go tomorrow?

00:01:52.195 --> 00:01:55.449
(Blows raspberry)
Dewey, don't make that face.

00:01:55.532 --> 00:01:57.572
What if the wind changes?
You'll get stuck that way.

00:01:57.868 --> 00:02:00.871
I accept that you don't
want me to do adult stuff...

00:02:00.954 --> 00:02:02.998
I don't like it,
but I accept it.

00:02:03.123 --> 00:02:04.750
But this movie is for kids.

00:02:04.833 --> 00:02:06.877
At least let me do kid stuff.

00:02:07.002 --> 00:02:08.688
Maybe your dad can take you.
Young Dwayne: Okay!

00:02:08.712 --> 00:02:10.797
Here are the showtimes.
10:00,10:30,11:00...

00:02:10.881 --> 00:02:12.507
Babe, I can't take him
to the movies.

00:02:12.591 --> 00:02:14.444
I gotta go over the match
for Lia's battle royale.

00:02:14.468 --> 00:02:16.637
Sotakelflniafler lcantafier

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.263
I gotta run an errand.
What errand?

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.265
Oh, this guy came to me with

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:21.850
a business opportunity
the other day.

00:02:21.933 --> 00:02:24.770
You wrestle for me,
you'll be my number one guy.

00:02:24.853 --> 00:02:27.105
Greg yao. My info's on the card.

00:02:27.898 --> 00:02:29.338
No big deal.
Which shirt do you like?

00:02:29.441 --> 00:02:30.543
What look are you going for?

00:02:30.567 --> 00:02:31.568
Professional cool.

00:02:31.652 --> 00:02:33.070
Like Sidney poitier
going to court.

00:02:33.236 --> 00:02:34.863
Beige turtleneck.
Corduroy pants.

00:02:34.946 --> 00:02:36.198
Done. (Alarm beeping)

00:02:36.281 --> 00:02:38.075
Oh, it's on! 9:30,10:00...

00:02:38.158 --> 00:02:39.159
Mom's big announcement.

00:02:39.242 --> 00:02:41.054
Terry: Your one-stop shop
for local Hawaiian sports.

00:02:41.078 --> 00:02:42.996
I'm Terry,
and with me, as always,

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.832
is the washakie from kapolei,
the chief.

00:02:45.916 --> 00:02:47.334
They call me the chief

00:02:47.417 --> 00:02:49.252
and I like the beef. (Laughs)

00:02:50.837 --> 00:02:52.756
And in the studio today,
we have the queen

00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:54.591
of polynesian pacific
pro wrestling,

00:02:54.675 --> 00:02:55.717
Lia maivia,

00:02:55.801 --> 00:02:57.719
with some huge news
for Hawaii wrestling fans.

00:02:57.803 --> 00:02:58.970
Uh, mahalo, Terry.

00:02:59.179 --> 00:03:01.640
I just want to say
to all your listeners

00:03:01.765 --> 00:03:03.350
that they should hold
onto their butts.

00:03:03.475 --> 00:03:04.976
It's going to be the greatest

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:06.561
battle royale in history.

00:03:06.687 --> 00:03:08.105
I got a hand on each cheek.

00:03:08.188 --> 00:03:10.565
Now, Lia, what about
local promoter Greg yao?

00:03:10.816 --> 00:03:12.275
He worked for your late husband

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:13.777
Peter maivia for years

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:15.612
and has now become
your competitor.

00:03:16.446 --> 00:03:18.281
(Speaking Samoan)

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:21.159
Ooh.

00:03:21.243 --> 00:03:23.161
Terry: So you're not concerned

00:03:23.245 --> 00:03:24.525
he poached two
of your best guys,

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:26.915
king Kong Bundy
and junkyard dog,

00:03:26.998 --> 00:03:28.875
signing them
to exclusive contracts.

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:31.336
My guys...
"Soulman" rocky Johnson,

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:34.131
andré the giant,
the wild Samoans,

00:03:34.214 --> 00:03:36.049
macho man Randy savage...

00:03:36.133 --> 00:03:38.844
They are the toughest and
the meanest guys out there.

00:03:39.136 --> 00:03:41.638
My late husband, Peter maivia...

00:03:41.763 --> 00:03:43.014
I love you, Peter.

00:03:43.098 --> 00:03:44.182
I miss you, high chief.

00:03:44.266 --> 00:03:45.767
He was a real chief

00:03:45.851 --> 00:03:47.936
and true king
of Hawaiian wrestling.

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:49.604
And that's why I am here

00:03:49.688 --> 00:03:51.314
to announce on the Terry show...

00:03:51.398 --> 00:03:52.482
Terry and the chief.

00:03:54.609 --> 00:03:57.571
That I am putting
Peter's championship belt

00:03:57.654 --> 00:03:59.614
where no other wrestler has ever

00:03:59.698 --> 00:04:00.907
held since his passing,

00:04:00.991 --> 00:04:03.034
on the line for the winner.

00:04:04.202 --> 00:04:05.203
(Singing)

00:04:05.287 --> 00:04:08.331
That you've been living under

00:04:08.415 --> 00:04:11.209
but you really don't remember

00:04:11.668 --> 00:04:15.088
was it something that they said?

00:04:15.464 --> 00:04:18.258
Are the voices in your head

00:04:19.342 --> 00:04:20.886
calling Gloria

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:25.223
let me guess, you're auditioning

00:04:25.307 --> 00:04:27.267
for star search? How'd you know?

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:28.602
So are they.

00:04:28.685 --> 00:04:29.728
(Women singing)

00:04:29.811 --> 00:04:31.021
Calling Gloria calling Gloria

00:04:31.855 --> 00:04:34.691
was it something that he said?

00:04:34.775 --> 00:04:37.277
But you really don't remember

00:04:38.612 --> 00:04:40.781
calling Gloria
and they got your number

00:04:40.864 --> 00:04:42.240
well, except for that guy.

00:04:42.324 --> 00:04:44.826
Actually, he just comes in
every week and reads the Bible.

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:46.578
"And the hand of the lord
was on me

00:04:46.953 --> 00:04:50.165
"and carried me out
in the spirit of the lord."

00:04:50.248 --> 00:04:51.958
(Funky upbeat music)

00:04:55.504 --> 00:04:56.963
Rocky: Hey, andré.
You're European,

00:04:57.297 --> 00:04:59.049
what you think of my outfit?

00:04:59.132 --> 00:05:00.133
I like it, boss.

00:05:00.342 --> 00:05:01.343
You look like, uh,

00:05:01.426 --> 00:05:03.220
cqumbo from the TV, huh?

00:05:03.845 --> 00:05:06.640
Don't arrest me, monsieur
cqumbo! (Laughing)

00:05:06.723 --> 00:05:07.849
Lia: All right, let's start.

00:05:08.058 --> 00:05:09.059
First... grandma?

00:05:09.142 --> 00:05:11.353
Yes, Dewey?
Is this meeting over?

00:05:11.436 --> 00:05:12.521
No, I've just started.

00:05:12.604 --> 00:05:13.831
Is there somewhere
you need to be?

00:05:13.855 --> 00:05:15.398
Yeah, e. T.

00:05:15.482 --> 00:05:16.983
Play e. T. With Francine.

00:05:17.067 --> 00:05:19.387
(Dog snoring) Wrap her up
in a blanket and she can be e. T.

00:05:22.113 --> 00:05:23.553
I could take Dewey
for the afternoon.

00:05:23.865 --> 00:05:26.159
Really?
Dad, can I go with andré?

00:05:26.243 --> 00:05:27.285
Please?

00:05:27.369 --> 00:05:28.870
Yes! Sure, it's okay with me.

00:05:28.954 --> 00:05:30.705
No, andré,
you need to hear the plan.

00:05:30.789 --> 00:05:32.165
André plan always the same, huh?

00:05:32.249 --> 00:05:35.210
André wrestle, everyone
hit andré with chair.

00:05:35.293 --> 00:05:36.294
André leave, no?

00:05:37.087 --> 00:05:38.338
Yeah, good. That's it.

00:05:38.421 --> 00:05:40.006
(Speaking in French)

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:43.677
(In English) Buh-bye,
cqumbo. (Laughing)

00:05:47.597 --> 00:05:50.559
Okay, so if we drive really fast

00:05:50.684 --> 00:05:52.853
we can make it to the 1:30
e. T. At pearlridge...

00:05:52.936 --> 00:05:53.937
André doesn't like movie.

00:05:54.312 --> 00:05:55.355
You don't like movies?

00:05:55.438 --> 00:05:57.315
André prefer books. Books?

00:05:57.399 --> 00:05:59.860
André has an even
better plan than movie.

00:05:59.943 --> 00:06:02.112
We are going to do
my favorite thing, huh?

00:06:02.195 --> 00:06:03.613
(Chuckles)

00:06:03.697 --> 00:06:05.991
Adult Dwayne: Ldidn't know it
then, but my day with andré

00:06:06.074 --> 00:06:08.702
was about to change
my perspective on everything.

00:06:11.162 --> 00:06:12.873
Okay, battle royale.

00:06:12.956 --> 00:06:17.210
As you all know, the winner takes
Peter's belt. Then we get a new champion.

00:06:17.294 --> 00:06:19.045
First thing,
everyone's in the ring.

00:06:19.129 --> 00:06:20.297
Get rid of the jobbers,

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:21.860
and then it's down to
our eight stars.

00:06:23.508 --> 00:06:25.510
Lia: Sergeant slaughter,
you will be eliminated

00:06:25.594 --> 00:06:28.430
by Ricky steamboat
after a high-crossbody.

00:06:28.513 --> 00:06:30.432
Sergeant: Great,
see you all at the bar.

00:06:30.515 --> 00:06:32.559
While steamboat
fires up the crowd,

00:06:32.642 --> 00:06:35.228
rocky, you hit him
with a dropkick, boom!

00:06:35.312 --> 00:06:36.354
Right out of the ring.

00:06:36.438 --> 00:06:37.439
Steamboat: Llove it.

00:06:37.522 --> 00:06:39.202
I'll stick the landing
like Nadia comaneci.

00:06:39.232 --> 00:06:42.569
Lia: Sheik, you will have
macho man in a camel clutch,

00:06:42.652 --> 00:06:43.987
then toss him out.

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:46.448
The iron sheik: Your
sheiky baby always delivers.

00:06:46.531 --> 00:06:49.826
Rocky and the wild Samoans
make quick work of sheik.

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:51.870
Man: Can 1 wave to my
girlfriend in the front row?

00:06:51.953 --> 00:06:53.997
Lia: No.
Man: That will upset her.

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:56.875
Then after the Samoans
attack andré with chairs,

00:06:56.958 --> 00:07:00.253
rocky joins in and the three
eliminate the giant.

00:07:00.337 --> 00:07:02.547
The wild Samoans turn on rocky.

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:06.509
Sika holds rocky up
as of a charges.

00:07:06.593 --> 00:07:10.013
Rocky back body drops of a
over the top rope.

00:07:10.096 --> 00:07:11.514
Afa: The fifth time this month.

00:07:11.598 --> 00:07:12.933
Think I would know better.

00:07:13.016 --> 00:07:16.102
Lia: Rocky hits sika with
the big sou/man right hand

00:07:16.186 --> 00:07:17.395
and out he goes.

00:07:18.063 --> 00:07:19.773
Rocky will be the new champ.

00:07:20.273 --> 00:07:21.274
Faamalo, rocky.

00:07:21.358 --> 00:07:22.525
Malo, rocky. Malo, malo.

00:07:22.609 --> 00:07:23.735
(Clapping) Man: Well done.

00:07:26.279 --> 00:07:27.280
Lia,

00:07:27.906 --> 00:07:28.907
I'm honored.

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:30.259
It's what Peter
would have wanted.

00:07:30.283 --> 00:07:31.409
What are we gonna do,

00:07:31.493 --> 00:07:32.702
give it to the sheik?

00:07:32.786 --> 00:07:34.204
There is a fly on this Danish.

00:07:34.287 --> 00:07:35.956
You jabronis never close box.

00:07:36.039 --> 00:07:37.399
It's been a rough
few weeks, rocky.

00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:39.751
You've been beside me
and you've supported me.

00:07:39.876 --> 00:07:41.544
Peter would have been proud of

00:07:41.628 --> 00:07:42.828
the kind of man you've become.

00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:46.383
Lia, you know how
you insist I take roll call

00:07:46.466 --> 00:07:47.592
before the meeting?

00:07:47.676 --> 00:07:49.010
Well, I forgot.

00:07:49.094 --> 00:07:51.888
So, I did it just now
and macho man is not here.

00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:54.265
Ey! Anyone know where Randy is?

00:07:54.349 --> 00:07:57.060
Yeah, he wanted me to tell
you he couldn't make it.

00:07:57.143 --> 00:07:59.229
Something about his girlfriend
Deborah's birthday.

00:07:59.312 --> 00:08:00.480
But don't worry.

00:08:00.563 --> 00:08:02.524
I've been taking notes for him.

00:08:02.607 --> 00:08:04.401
"Girlfriend's birthdays."

00:08:04.484 --> 00:08:06.778
Bundy and jyd's "sick mothers."

00:08:06.861 --> 00:08:08.488
Greg yao's behind this.

00:08:08.571 --> 00:08:10.657
Bob, go get the car.

00:08:12.242 --> 00:08:13.618
(Tense exciting music)

00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:16.621
Rocky: How'd it go?

00:08:16.705 --> 00:08:18.665
Turns out every woman
in Hawaii is auditioning

00:08:18.748 --> 00:08:21.501
for star search
by singing Gloria.

00:08:21.584 --> 00:08:23.253
Ugh. Where's Dewey?

00:08:23.336 --> 00:08:25.505
With Andre. But relax...

00:08:25.672 --> 00:08:27.924
You're here with rocky Johnson.

00:08:28.008 --> 00:08:29.426
Want one of
my patented back rubs?

00:08:29.509 --> 00:08:30.969
How am I supposed to stand out

00:08:31.052 --> 00:08:33.346
when I'm singing the same song
as everybody else?

00:08:33.430 --> 00:08:36.099
Well, if you want people
to remember you,

00:08:36.182 --> 00:08:38.285
you gotta show them something
they've never seen before.

00:08:38.309 --> 00:08:40.228
That's okay for you to say,
you're a showman.

00:08:40.311 --> 00:08:42.105
I get nervous when
I wear my red belt.

00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:44.649
I think you should sing
an original song.

00:08:45.191 --> 00:08:46.651
(Laughs sarcastically)
Sure, yeah.

00:08:46.735 --> 00:08:48.653
I'll just whip up
a song better than Gloria,

00:08:48.737 --> 00:08:50.530
one of the greatest songs
of all time.

00:08:50.613 --> 00:08:52.198
Nothing's gonna make
you stand out more

00:08:52.282 --> 00:08:54.325
than something only you
could've written.

00:08:55.869 --> 00:08:57.495
I gotta run.
I'll catch you later.

00:08:57.579 --> 00:08:59.205
Squeeze the bicep for good luck?

00:09:00.331 --> 00:09:01.332
That helped.

00:09:04.627 --> 00:09:06.337
You know what, Andre was right.

00:09:06.421 --> 00:09:08.590
He was rude, but he was right.

00:09:10.467 --> 00:09:12.218
Lia: That way,
Randy's in room 302.

00:09:13.011 --> 00:09:14.179
(Whispering) Three, two, one.

00:09:14.262 --> 00:09:15.597
(Crashing)

00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:16.723
Whoa!

00:09:16.806 --> 00:09:18.683
Bob, Lia? What the hell?

00:09:18.767 --> 00:09:22.103
Oh, good, it really is
your girlfriend's birthday.

00:09:22.187 --> 00:09:24.731
Hey, happy birthday, Deborah.
Thank you.

00:09:24.856 --> 00:09:25.982
Okay, bye!

00:09:26.066 --> 00:09:27.650
Sorry, I'll just...

00:09:28.485 --> 00:09:30.487
Please. Leave, Bob.

00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:31.780
I'll tell maintenance...

00:09:31.863 --> 00:09:33.343
The front desk to
send up maintenance.

00:09:33.406 --> 00:09:35.867
Have them wait 20,
maybe 30 minutes.

00:09:35.950 --> 00:09:38.536
Beat it! Right, yeah.

00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:40.288
Big elbow! Hey!

00:09:41.414 --> 00:09:43.124
(Jaunty French song playing)

00:09:43.208 --> 00:09:44.751
(Cooing and clucking)

00:09:47.128 --> 00:09:49.089
You really think this is fun?

00:09:49.172 --> 00:09:50.256
So fun.

00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:53.510
And relaxing, non?
Want to borrow some seed?

00:09:53.718 --> 00:09:55.678
No, I don't want any seed.

00:09:55.762 --> 00:09:57.472
I want to be at the movies,
watching e. T.

00:09:57.555 --> 00:09:58.807
And having fun.

00:10:01.017 --> 00:10:02.811
What do you love
about the movie, huh?

00:10:03.269 --> 00:10:04.854
I like the stories?
(Andre chuckles)

00:10:05.522 --> 00:10:07.690
You don't have to go to
the cinema to find a story.

00:10:07.982 --> 00:10:10.443
Everything has a story to tell.

00:10:11.069 --> 00:10:12.737
Have you ever
looked at the moon?

00:10:12.821 --> 00:10:14.614
Um, yeah?

00:10:14.781 --> 00:10:17.325
Some people used to think
the moon was made of cheese.

00:10:18.201 --> 00:10:19.661
Cheese?

00:10:19.744 --> 00:10:21.496
Because the craters,

00:10:21.579 --> 00:10:23.299
they look like
the hole in the Swiss cheese.

00:10:24.249 --> 00:10:25.750
It depend on
how you look at it, non?

00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:29.295
Regarde, the big one.

00:10:30.338 --> 00:10:31.881
Le cochon approaches.

00:10:31.965 --> 00:10:33.383
Get out of here, porker!

00:10:35.176 --> 00:10:36.761
It is not le cochon's fault
he is big.

00:10:37.011 --> 00:10:38.304
And it is not easy for him.

00:10:38.555 --> 00:10:39.973
The birds,
they do not include him.

00:10:40.056 --> 00:10:41.474
And the people,
they shoo him away

00:10:41.558 --> 00:10:42.838
because they think he is greedy.

00:10:44.811 --> 00:10:45.812
But not me.

00:10:47.188 --> 00:10:48.565
He is my favorite,

00:10:48.982 --> 00:10:50.400
which is why I give him
the moon.

00:10:50.483 --> 00:10:51.693
(Gentle music playing)

00:10:54.737 --> 00:10:56.114
(Cooing)

00:10:56.906 --> 00:10:58.575
(Chuckles)

00:11:00.326 --> 00:11:01.679
Adult Dwayne:
You know, looking back,

00:11:01.703 --> 00:11:02.829
andré was trying to show me

00:11:02.912 --> 00:11:04.747
that there are a million
different ways

00:11:04.831 --> 00:11:05.832
to look at something...

00:11:07.250 --> 00:11:10.128
If you're only willing
to change your perspective.

00:11:12.338 --> 00:11:13.882
Greg yao.

00:11:15.175 --> 00:11:16.384
Sorry I'm late.

00:11:16.467 --> 00:11:18.027
I was surprised
you even wanted to meet,

00:11:18.469 --> 00:11:19.949
seeing as how
you're Lia's son-in-law.

00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:22.015
I'm also a business man.

00:11:22.182 --> 00:11:23.308
(Both chuckle)

00:11:24.184 --> 00:11:25.810
Nice cowboy boots.

00:11:25.894 --> 00:11:26.936
They're not subtle.

00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:29.480
But neither am I. (Chuckles)

00:11:29.564 --> 00:11:31.816
Hope you don't mind, I
pre-ordered us some calamari.

00:11:32.358 --> 00:11:33.860
I'm good, thanks.

00:11:33.943 --> 00:11:35.069
Are you sure?

00:11:35.153 --> 00:11:37.322
You mightwant to
take a closer look.

00:11:41.701 --> 00:11:43.411
Is that a gold chain
that says "no"?

00:11:43.703 --> 00:11:45.455
What? (Scoffs)

00:11:45.538 --> 00:11:46.765
Damn it, it's got
some cocktail sauce on it.

00:11:46.789 --> 00:11:47.916
Give me a minute.

00:11:49.334 --> 00:11:50.919
It says "no. 1"

00:11:51.044 --> 00:11:53.421
because that's what you'll
be when you sign with me.

00:11:59.135 --> 00:12:01.304
Lia: That was really
beautiful, wasn't it?

00:12:01.512 --> 00:12:04.599
A man having sex with his
girlfriend on her birthday?

00:12:05.642 --> 00:12:08.311
It really restored
my faith in people, you know?

00:12:08.686 --> 00:12:10.438
We were lucky to see it.

00:12:10.647 --> 00:12:13.900
Lia: Oh, a zippy's.
Good, I want some chili rice.

00:12:13.983 --> 00:12:15.318
(Laidback music playing)

00:12:16.819 --> 00:12:18.863
What do you want to drink?
Fruit punch.

00:12:19.781 --> 00:12:20.782
(Car door shuts)

00:12:24.827 --> 00:12:26.467
(Bob singing) Fruit
punch and a chili rice

00:12:26.788 --> 00:12:29.249
(sighs) Come on,
you can do this, ata.

00:12:34.504 --> 00:12:35.964
(Ukulele strumming)

00:12:36.673 --> 00:12:41.511
Don't look at me all angry, baby

00:12:42.929 --> 00:12:46.432
I know it's not your way

00:12:47.058 --> 00:12:49.477
what if the breeze stops blowing

00:12:50.937 --> 00:12:54.190
and you get stuck this way?

00:12:56.192 --> 00:12:59.988
I know
you're getting older, baby

00:13:00.071 --> 00:13:02.782
lasked the calendar to wait

00:13:03.032 --> 00:13:06.411
but he laughed at me and told me

00:13:06.494 --> 00:13:08.788
I'm already late

00:13:10.248 --> 00:13:13.001
so I opened up the windows, baby

00:13:13.167 --> 00:13:17.046
and I left the door ajar

00:13:17.588 --> 00:13:20.466
so the wind
might change direction

00:13:20.550 --> 00:13:24.178
(playing over tape recorder)
And you'll stay always as you are

00:13:25.888 --> 00:13:27.265
iloveit really?

00:13:27.348 --> 00:13:29.017
Oh, this is your rocky shuffle!

00:13:29.142 --> 00:13:30.810
Star search is gonna love it.

00:13:31.561 --> 00:13:33.313
All right,
let's head to the arena.

00:13:33.396 --> 00:13:34.999
You can drop me off and
I'll see you and Dewey later?

00:13:35.023 --> 00:13:36.065
Already?

00:13:36.149 --> 00:13:38.151
Yeah, I just
got a lot on my mind.

00:13:38.234 --> 00:13:40.111
Getting Peter's belt, that's...

00:13:40.194 --> 00:13:42.572
That's a big deal. Yeah.

00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:45.742
But you know what'll help?

00:13:45.825 --> 00:13:47.577
Rewind that tape. (Laughing)

00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:49.454
Let's hear that hit
one more time.

00:13:49.620 --> 00:13:50.621
(Turns on tape recorder)

00:13:50.705 --> 00:13:52.891
Young Dwayne and you really
think there's different versions of me

00:13:52.915 --> 00:13:54.292
living in different dimensions?

00:13:54.417 --> 00:13:55.918
(In French) Oui.

00:13:56.002 --> 00:13:57.795
(In English) Well, if
there are other deweys,

00:13:57.879 --> 00:13:59.547
I hope one's big like you.

00:13:59.797 --> 00:14:02.050
So everyone would have to
listen to him.

00:14:02.592 --> 00:14:04.552
Big, small, it doesn't matter.

00:14:05.303 --> 00:14:06.888
If you think small,

00:14:06.971 --> 00:14:09.265
you will definitely
stay small, huh?

00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:12.268
That's easy for you to say.
You're big.

00:14:12.352 --> 00:14:14.645
Everything's easy for you.

00:14:14.729 --> 00:14:16.064
Sometime Andre is too big.

00:14:16.356 --> 00:14:18.816
Too big for chair,
too big for hat.

00:14:19.734 --> 00:14:21.277
Too big to ride horses.

00:14:21.611 --> 00:14:23.363
Sometime Andre feel like
king Kong.

00:14:23.488 --> 00:14:26.282
You ever see the king Kong?
That is Andre's favorite movie.

00:14:26.824 --> 00:14:29.660
But I thought you said
you didn't like the movies?

00:14:30.953 --> 00:14:32.538
Andre lied.

00:14:32.622 --> 00:14:34.707
I used to love to go to
the movies when I was a kid.

00:14:34.874 --> 00:14:37.960
But I am too big now,
and people get angry at me.

00:14:38.044 --> 00:14:40.421
I have to sit in the back
where I cannot see.

00:14:40.546 --> 00:14:42.215
Why don't you just get glasses?

00:14:42.507 --> 00:14:43.591
(Chuckles)

00:14:43.674 --> 00:14:44.717
(In French) Vanité.

00:14:44.842 --> 00:14:46.320
(In English) You're the same,
you know.

00:14:46.344 --> 00:14:48.012
As who? As le cochon.

00:14:48.096 --> 00:14:50.348
You guys are both bigger
than everybody else

00:14:50.431 --> 00:14:52.433
and people are gonna
treat you differently

00:14:52.517 --> 00:14:54.102
and it's not fair.

00:14:54.185 --> 00:14:57.605
What if the problem isn't that
you're too big for the world,

00:14:57.688 --> 00:15:00.233
it's that the world
is just too small for you?

00:15:03.486 --> 00:15:04.612
Andre?

00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:09.617
A very clever little boy.

00:15:12.745 --> 00:15:14.288
Jump on my back.

00:15:14.372 --> 00:15:16.457
Adult Dwayne: Did I consider
choosing a running mate

00:15:16.541 --> 00:15:17.792
who I had more in common with?

00:15:18.042 --> 00:15:19.210
Of course I did.

00:15:19.627 --> 00:15:22.296
But then I started to think
about Andre the giant

00:15:22.630 --> 00:15:24.382
and his birds.

00:15:25.591 --> 00:15:27.277
Adult Dwayne: He was
the eighth wonder of the world.

00:15:27.301 --> 00:15:28.803
And he had enough
of an open mind

00:15:28.886 --> 00:15:31.097
to listen to
a 10-year-old scrub like me.

00:15:32.098 --> 00:15:34.225
(E.t. Cooing)

00:15:34.392 --> 00:15:35.935
(Whimsical music playing)

00:15:38.479 --> 00:15:40.356
What is the monster's

00:15:46.028 --> 00:15:47.738
Adult Dwayne:

00:16:14.474 --> 00:16:16.058

Announcer: Get ready
for the 18-man battle royale.

00:16:21.147 --> 00:16:22.708
Each wrestler has
to throw their opponent

00:16:22.732 --> 00:16:23.983
over the top rope

00:16:24.066 --> 00:16:25.276
and the last man in the ring

00:16:25.526 --> 00:16:26.736
is the champion.

00:16:26.819 --> 00:16:28.237
Yeah! Look at this crowd.

00:16:28.321 --> 00:16:29.447
This is amazing, mom.

00:16:29.822 --> 00:16:31.157
You're in for a show.

Announcer: It looks like
everyone is piling on andré.

00:16:44.587 --> 00:16:47.381
Will they smother the
eighth wonder of the world?

00:16:49.342 --> 00:16:51.969
And the giant does it again.
Can't keep him down.

00:16:56.349 --> 00:17:00.311
Gloria, you're always
on the run now

00:17:00.394 --> 00:17:01.729

00:17:05.274 --> 00:17:06.484

You gotta get him somehow

00:17:09.946 --> 00:17:11.822

announcer:
And Ricky steamboat is out.

00:17:21.290 --> 00:17:23.209

you really don't remember

00:17:26.963 --> 00:17:28.923
macho man, over the top rope.

00:17:29.006 --> 00:17:30.007
Out he goes.

00:17:31.092 --> 00:17:33.386
Are the voices in your head

00:17:33.469 --> 00:17:34.887

00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:37.682

announcer: And the sheik is out.

00:17:40.268 --> 00:17:41.352
Gloria

00:17:42.853 --> 00:17:45.064

00:17:46.691 --> 00:17:48.776
If everybody wants you

00:17:49.318 --> 00:17:50.361

00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:55.741

Will rocky be able to hang on?

00:17:57.743 --> 00:17:59.579
Leave them hangin' on the line

00:18:44.582 --> 00:18:46.876
Announcer: Wait a
minute. The sheik is back!

00:18:47.084 --> 00:18:48.628
Must have gone
through the ropes,

00:18:48.711 --> 00:18:49.712
not over the top rope.

00:18:49.795 --> 00:18:51.172
He could still win this thing.

00:18:51.255 --> 00:18:52.357
What the hell are you doing?

00:18:52.381 --> 00:18:54.050
Lia changed finish last minute.

00:18:58.554 --> 00:19:01.599
(Bob singing) Fruit
punch and a chili rice

00:19:02.058 --> 00:19:03.768
(ambient dramatic music)

00:19:05.227 --> 00:19:06.312
(Faint ringing)

00:19:07.688 --> 00:19:09.023

Rocky, rocky, rocky!

00:19:17.865 --> 00:19:19.533
Fine. Shoot me off the rope.

00:19:19.617 --> 00:19:21.661
Hlgetmysefiout okay, bubba.

00:19:21.744 --> 00:19:22.953

polynesian pacific champion,

00:19:33.464 --> 00:19:36.842

Mom, what's going on?

00:19:38.969 --> 00:19:40.429
Rocky lost.

00:19:40.513 --> 00:19:42.390
(Crowd booing)

00:19:45.434 --> 00:19:47.812
Guess you forgot to tell me
you changed the finish.

00:19:47.895 --> 00:19:49.563
I saw you, rocky, with yao.

00:19:49.689 --> 00:19:51.107
So I double-crossed you

00:19:51.190 --> 00:19:52.775
before you could
double-cross me.

00:19:53.275 --> 00:19:54.276
(Tense music)

00:19:54.902 --> 00:19:56.070
You're right.

00:19:56.153 --> 00:19:57.780
I did meet with yao.

00:19:58.197 --> 00:20:00.032
I guarantee you
the championship belt.

00:20:00.199 --> 00:20:01.659
You won't lose a match.

00:20:02.159 --> 00:20:03.452
All right.

00:20:04.036 --> 00:20:05.037
Now it's my turn.

00:20:05.371 --> 00:20:06.831
You worked for my father-in-law.

00:20:06.914 --> 00:20:09.208
And then when he dies
and Lia needs you the most,

00:20:09.291 --> 00:20:11.377
you stab her in the back
and steal her guys?

00:20:11.711 --> 00:20:13.462
Fine. You've clearly
made up your mind.

00:20:13.546 --> 00:20:14.906
Mmm-hmm
why did you even come here?

00:20:15.089 --> 00:20:17.633
Well, yao, you stole
wrestlers from Lia.

00:20:17.883 --> 00:20:20.052
And when you
take from my family,

00:20:20.136 --> 00:20:21.345
I take something back.

00:20:22.388 --> 00:20:23.514
You like my outfit?

00:20:23.597 --> 00:20:25.725
I mean, iwent back and forth
on it all day.

00:20:25.808 --> 00:20:27.393
Couldn't decide what to wear.

00:20:27.476 --> 00:20:29.061
But I think...

00:20:29.145 --> 00:20:30.813
I think I finally found it!

00:20:31.439 --> 00:20:32.815
It's the perfect outfit

00:20:33.190 --> 00:20:34.775
to wear with yellow...

00:20:34.859 --> 00:20:36.068
Cowboy...

00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:37.361
Boots.

00:20:37.987 --> 00:20:40.614
(Moody rock guitar playing)

00:20:45.703 --> 00:20:47.538
Oh, rocky...

00:20:47.621 --> 00:20:50.249
Adult Dwayne: Even in the
wild world of professional wrestling,

00:20:50.332 --> 00:20:52.585
no one expects
a screw job finish.

00:20:52.793 --> 00:20:55.004
Is it wrong or is it justified?

00:20:55.087 --> 00:20:56.255
Well, like all things,

00:20:56.338 --> 00:20:58.132
it just depends
on your perspective.

00:20:58.466 --> 00:21:00.926
Sometimes we get locked in
to one way of thinking.

00:21:01.093 --> 00:21:02.136
But, lucky for me,

00:21:02.219 --> 00:21:05.055
my experience with Andre
forever impacted

00:21:05.139 --> 00:21:06.348
the way I look at the world.

00:21:06.432 --> 00:21:08.392
Monica will always push me

00:21:08.976 --> 00:21:10.686
to consider
other points of view.

00:21:10.770 --> 00:21:13.773
But our guiding iightwill
always be our shared values

00:21:13.856 --> 00:21:15.608
and love of country.

00:21:15.691 --> 00:21:17.359
Thank you all for joining me
this morning.

00:21:17.443 --> 00:21:19.779
General, thank you so...
Also I'd like to

00:21:19.862 --> 00:21:21.071
say hello to my husband.

00:21:22.364 --> 00:21:23.699
Hi, Daryl.

00:21:24.033 --> 00:21:26.285
