WEBVTT

00:00:07.883 --> 00:00:09.635
Good evening. I'm Randall park.

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:11.428
As election day draws closer,

00:00:11.512 --> 00:00:13.263
we caught up
with candidate Johnson

00:00:13.347 --> 00:00:15.349
and asked him
how he was feeling.

00:00:15.432 --> 00:00:18.393
Cautiously optimistic
but still confident that

00:00:18.477 --> 00:00:20.157
the American people
believe in our message.

00:00:20.229 --> 00:00:21.647
Big day's almost here, Randall.

00:00:21.772 --> 00:00:22.814
I can taste it.

00:00:22.898 --> 00:00:24.233
And, uh, what's it taste like?

00:00:24.316 --> 00:00:25.734
Almost as good as this Tequila.

00:00:25.817 --> 00:00:26.818
Almost.

00:00:26.902 --> 00:00:28.278
Probably also almost as good

00:00:28.362 --> 00:00:29.738
as this hard pear cider.

00:00:29.821 --> 00:00:31.990
That's been expired
for easily over a year.

00:00:32.074 --> 00:00:33.116
(Chuckles)

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.409
We saved it for the cat.

00:00:34.493 --> 00:00:36.119
Really? (Both chuckle)

00:00:36.828 --> 00:00:38.914
So, the race is tight. Mmm-hmm.

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:40.999
No one can predict
which way it's going to go.

00:00:41.083 --> 00:00:43.085
Would you consider
this accomplishment a win,

00:00:43.168 --> 00:00:44.294
no matter the outcome?

00:00:44.378 --> 00:00:46.088
No way (chuckles), no way.

00:00:46.213 --> 00:00:48.215
There's that legendary
competitive fire.

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:50.425
I try to do anything
like I do everything,

00:00:50.509 --> 00:00:51.593
and that's with all I got.

00:00:51.677 --> 00:00:53.428
And you can work hard,
but sometimes

00:00:53.512 --> 00:00:55.347
there are variables
you just can't control.

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:56.590
Of course you're referring to

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.475
not being cast as Pedro cerrano

00:00:58.559 --> 00:00:59.810
in lin-Manuel Miranda's

00:00:59.893 --> 00:01:01.645
musical remake of major league.

00:01:01.895 --> 00:01:02.975
No, not talking about that.

00:01:03.021 --> 00:01:04.356
But that one did sting.

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.042
I'm talking about
playing college football

00:01:06.066 --> 00:01:07.985
in the early '90s
at the university of Miami,

00:01:08.068 --> 00:01:10.862
when I had big dreams
of playing in the NFL,

00:01:10.946 --> 00:01:13.115
and giving my family
a better life.

00:01:13.198 --> 00:01:14.551
Reporter: All right, folks,
our coverage

00:01:14.575 --> 00:01:17.411
of the 1995 NFL draft
continues now.

00:01:17.494 --> 00:01:19.079
Let's talk to
the man of the hour,

00:01:19.162 --> 00:01:20.956
Dwayne "ladybird" Johnson.

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:22.416
Interviewer: Dwayne,
how's it feel

00:01:22.499 --> 00:01:24.668
to be the first pick
in the NFL draft?

00:01:24.751 --> 00:01:26.670
I'm proof dreams do come true,

00:01:26.753 --> 00:01:29.506
and a few years ago,
I made a promise.

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:31.008
I bought my parents a mansion.

00:01:32.634 --> 00:01:34.886
I don't beheveit

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:35.971
Dwayne...

00:01:36.388 --> 00:01:37.389
Dwayne.

00:01:37.472 --> 00:01:38.473
Dwayne!

00:01:39.641 --> 00:01:40.767
Dwayne.

00:01:40.851 --> 00:01:42.811
You all right?

00:01:42.894 --> 00:01:43.937
Yeah.

00:01:44.021 --> 00:01:45.022
What up, kev?

00:01:45.355 --> 00:01:46.356
You were asleep.

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:48.358
Yeah, I've been
working hard in camp.

00:01:48.442 --> 00:01:50.110
Going after that starting spot.

00:01:50.193 --> 00:01:52.154
Just need to power
my body down for a minute.

00:01:52.279 --> 00:01:53.363
Micro naps.

00:01:53.447 --> 00:01:54.698
Lovethose. Checkit

00:01:57.784 --> 00:01:58.869
boom.

00:01:58.952 --> 00:01:59.953
Refreshed.

00:02:00.037 --> 00:02:01.079
Yo, yo, yo, what up?

00:02:01.163 --> 00:02:02.706
My dawgs, my dawgs, my dawgs.

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:04.416
Gushers? Gushers, baby? Gushers?

00:02:04.499 --> 00:02:05.500
(Smac ks) Owl

00:02:05.584 --> 00:02:07.210
sapptop hey, yo, sapp.

00:02:07.294 --> 00:02:08.754
This is the d-line room.

00:02:08.837 --> 00:02:10.213
I think your tight end meeting's

00:02:10.297 --> 00:02:12.174
at the old spaghetti factory.

00:02:12.257 --> 00:02:13.300
(Team chuckles)

00:02:13.383 --> 00:02:14.943
Spaghetti sounds good
right now, but no,

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:16.011
I'm in the right place.

00:02:16.803 --> 00:02:18.889
Coach said he wanted
to convert me to d-line.

00:02:18.972 --> 00:02:20.098
So watch out.

00:02:20.182 --> 00:02:21.516
I'm here for your job.

00:02:22.267 --> 00:02:23.518
Okay, okay.

00:02:24.061 --> 00:02:26.355
My acid reflux is bananas today.

00:02:26.772 --> 00:02:28.732
I'll try not to take it out
on you, okay? (Groans)

00:02:28.815 --> 00:02:31.234
Adult Dwayne: Even though sapp
was an insanely talented

00:02:31.318 --> 00:02:32.903
football player,
I was determined

00:02:32.986 --> 00:02:34.988
to show coach Erickson
I still had what it took

00:02:35.072 --> 00:02:36.073
to be a starter.

00:02:36.156 --> 00:02:37.449
Camp's wrapping up
in a few days,

00:02:37.532 --> 00:02:38.760
so it's make or break
for a lot of you

00:02:38.784 --> 00:02:40.035
baflhng for starting spots.

00:02:40.452 --> 00:02:42.663
We got a championship-caliber
team this year.

00:02:42.746 --> 00:02:43.866
D-line's gonna lead the way.

00:02:43.914 --> 00:02:46.166
All: Yes, sir.
Second, sports agents.

00:02:46.833 --> 00:02:48.752
Now, these jokers
are lurking around,

00:02:48.835 --> 00:02:50.021
trying to wine and dine
some of you.

00:02:50.045 --> 00:02:51.838
Where? Here I am.
(Team chuckles)

00:02:51.922 --> 00:02:53.924
It's illegal,
so use your brains.

00:02:54.007 --> 00:02:55.092
Avoid these guys.

00:02:55.175 --> 00:02:56.444
And don't accept
any of their gifts.

00:02:56.468 --> 00:02:58.095
Is a car technically a gift?

00:02:58.178 --> 00:02:59.179
Yes.

00:02:59.262 --> 00:03:00.342
What if it's a Honda civic?

00:03:00.555 --> 00:03:02.015
It's still a gift. Moving on.

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:03.600
What about a sandwich?
What about it?

00:03:03.684 --> 00:03:05.519
Is it a gift? Technically?

00:03:05.602 --> 00:03:07.580
If it's bought for you by an
agent, then, yes, it's a gift.

00:03:07.604 --> 00:03:08.772
What about a panini?

00:03:08.855 --> 00:03:10.607
All sandwiches bought
by agents are gifts.

00:03:10.691 --> 00:03:11.959
Would you consider
a hot dog a sandwich?

00:03:11.983 --> 00:03:12.984
Damn it, yes!

00:03:13.068 --> 00:03:14.504
See, I disagree.
(Indistinct chatter)

00:03:14.528 --> 00:03:15.968
Moving on.
You've got your playbooks.

00:03:16.029 --> 00:03:17.656
Let's talk game strategy.

00:03:24.371 --> 00:03:25.622
I forgot mines.

00:03:25.706 --> 00:03:26.832
It's cool if we share?

00:03:27.582 --> 00:03:29.126
Come on, dawg. You hoggin'.

00:03:30.293 --> 00:03:31.854
Adult Dwayne: Sapp was one of
the best athletes

00:03:31.878 --> 00:03:33.672
Miami football had ever seen.

00:03:33.755 --> 00:03:35.048
But this was my year,

00:03:35.132 --> 00:03:36.883
and I knew I had
nothing to worry about.

00:03:37.175 --> 00:03:38.455
(The devil made me do it
playing)

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:39.761
The devil made me do it

00:03:40.262 --> 00:03:41.263
the devil made me do it

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:43.390
the devil made me do it

00:03:44.433 --> 00:03:45.642
the devil made me do it

00:03:46.393 --> 00:03:47.477
the devil made me do it

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:49.521
the devil made me do it

00:03:50.397 --> 00:03:51.815
the devil made me do it

00:03:51.898 --> 00:03:53.483
the devil made me do it

00:03:54.234 --> 00:03:55.360
the devil made me do it

00:03:56.486 --> 00:03:57.529
the devil made me do it

00:03:57.612 --> 00:03:59.531
yo, I'm not even tired out here!

00:04:03.493 --> 00:04:05.871
I'm sweating
cool water Cologne, baby.

00:04:05.954 --> 00:04:06.955
Sapp, baby!

00:04:07.038 --> 00:04:08.832
Whoo-hoo, sapp!

00:04:08.915 --> 00:04:10.917
Adult Dwayne: So, yeah.
Obviously, I was wrong.

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:14.504
Okay, listen up.

00:04:14.713 --> 00:04:15.839
Uh, first of all,

00:04:15.922 --> 00:04:18.133
whoever recommended
zantac for my heartburn,

00:04:18.216 --> 00:04:20.051
thank you.
Honestly, life-changing.

00:04:20.135 --> 00:04:21.845
You're welcome, coach.
(Team chuckles)

00:04:21.928 --> 00:04:23.805
Second, season starts in a week,

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:25.158
and the coaches have
made their decisions

00:04:25.182 --> 00:04:27.017
on our first string defense.

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:28.786
I know how hard you all worked
in the off-season,

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:30.729
and I'm proud of you, okay?

00:04:30.812 --> 00:04:31.938
Each and every one of you.

00:04:32.773 --> 00:04:35.442
Okay, starting d-line will be...

00:04:35.525 --> 00:04:36.735
Madearis,

00:04:36.818 --> 00:04:37.819
Patrick,

00:04:37.903 --> 00:04:38.945
Miller,

00:04:39.029 --> 00:04:40.030
and sapp.

00:04:40.614 --> 00:04:41.656
(All applauding)

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:44.201
Was there ever
a doubt about this?

00:04:44.284 --> 00:04:45.636
Coach Erickson: Hey, you guys
all earned it.

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:47.412
But remember,
anything can happen, okay?

00:04:47.496 --> 00:04:48.556
You need to go
out there each week,

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:49.873
and you need to fight for it.

00:04:49.956 --> 00:04:52.751
Okay, starting corners
will be...

00:04:52.834 --> 00:04:54.127
Mcnem.

00:04:56.963 --> 00:04:58.673
(Telephone ringing)
(Indistinct chatter)

00:04:58.757 --> 00:05:00.300
Yes, that's right.
It's a six-day,

00:05:00.383 --> 00:05:01.802
seven-night cruise
around the keys.

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.140
(Phones ringing) Of
course, that's all included.

00:05:06.598 --> 00:05:08.225
Sure, I'm happy
to walk you through

00:05:08.308 --> 00:05:09.428
those family packages again.

00:05:09.476 --> 00:05:10.956
Just let me place you
on a brief hold.

00:05:12.771 --> 00:05:15.232
(Phone ringing)

00:05:15.315 --> 00:05:17.067
They're still winning,
40 to three.

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:18.568
Why is the Miami mascot

00:05:18.652 --> 00:05:20.111
like a duck with no pants?

00:05:20.195 --> 00:05:21.279
Has Dewey played yet?

00:05:21.363 --> 00:05:23.657
Not yet, but we saw him
on the sidelines.

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:25.200
Best looking kid on the bench.

00:05:25.283 --> 00:05:26.284
Look, I'm stuck at work.

00:05:26.368 --> 00:05:27.494
I can't make it home in time

00:05:27.577 --> 00:05:28.679
before the end of the game,
so just make sure

00:05:28.703 --> 00:05:29.704
you tape the whole thing.

00:05:29.788 --> 00:05:30.831
I always do.

00:05:30.914 --> 00:05:31.915
The whole thing, rocky.

00:05:31.998 --> 00:05:33.518
Sometimes the band members
get knocked down

00:05:33.542 --> 00:05:35.520
by celebrating players, and
I think that's really funny.

00:05:35.544 --> 00:05:37.462
Yes, I will tape
the whole thing.

00:05:38.588 --> 00:05:39.589
(Line switches)

00:05:39.673 --> 00:05:41.007
So, for our family packages...

00:05:41.466 --> 00:05:42.551
Oh!

00:05:42.926 --> 00:05:45.220
That's a bad man! (Laughs)

00:05:45.303 --> 00:05:47.180
Man: (On TV) In on the tackle
back at the 42,

00:05:47.264 --> 00:05:48.682
Mr. Sapp, Mr. Reilly.

00:05:49.558 --> 00:05:51.369
Adult Dwayne: I might not have
got the starting job,

00:05:51.393 --> 00:05:52.686
but I tried to stay motivated

00:05:52.769 --> 00:05:54.104
and tried to stay ready.

00:05:54.521 --> 00:05:56.147
(Alarm buzzing)

00:05:56.231 --> 00:05:59.109
(Funky music playing)

00:06:01.361 --> 00:06:03.613
But I didn't get my number
called as much as I'd hoped.

00:06:03.697 --> 00:06:07.284
Late in the fourth quarter,
Miami 22, Nebraska 0.

00:06:07.367 --> 00:06:08.511
Adult Dwayne:
And before you knew it,

00:06:08.535 --> 00:06:10.704
we were playing for
the national championship.

00:06:10.787 --> 00:06:12.497
The hurricanes
are four minutes away

00:06:12.581 --> 00:06:14.040
from being national champions.

00:06:14.124 --> 00:06:18.420
(Shouts and impacts)

00:06:18.503 --> 00:06:20.630
(Cheers and applause)

00:06:20.714 --> 00:06:22.382
(Whistle blows)

00:06:22.465 --> 00:06:24.092
Dewey hasn't played
a single snap yet.

00:06:24.342 --> 00:06:26.636
Well, at least his uniform
is nice and clean.

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:28.346
Saves someone
in the locker room a wash.

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:30.098
Miami mascot is a mess.

00:06:30.807 --> 00:06:32.642
Oh, the other mascot.

00:06:32.726 --> 00:06:34.185
Nice cowboy.

00:06:34.269 --> 00:06:35.562
Handsome.

00:06:35.645 --> 00:06:37.063
Like Lee Marvin.

00:06:37.147 --> 00:06:38.148
(Whistle blows)

00:06:38.231 --> 00:06:39.691
Okay, Dwayne, let's go.
You're in.

00:06:39.774 --> 00:06:40.775
Yes, coach.

00:06:40.859 --> 00:06:42.402
(Team cheering)

00:06:42.485 --> 00:06:43.653
This is it!

00:06:44.654 --> 00:06:45.655
(Whistle blows)

00:06:45.739 --> 00:06:46.740
Fourth down.

00:06:49.451 --> 00:06:50.911
That was it?

00:06:52.579 --> 00:06:53.723
It was so exciting to see you

00:06:53.747 --> 00:06:55.248
win the championship, Dewey.

00:06:55.332 --> 00:06:57.292
Did you see those band members
get knocked down?

00:06:57.375 --> 00:06:59.753
The boy with the tuba
just kept rolling. (Chuckles)

00:06:59.836 --> 00:07:01.272
I'm sorry you drove
all the way out here

00:07:01.296 --> 00:07:03.131
just to see me get in
for only one play.

00:07:03.214 --> 00:07:05.258
A great play, my favorite play.

00:07:05.342 --> 00:07:07.552
And I can't wait to see
your championship ring.

00:07:07.636 --> 00:07:09.596
A man needs jewelry
with a story.

00:07:09.679 --> 00:07:11.181
Yes, Peter used to always talk

00:07:11.264 --> 00:07:13.975
about the earring he got
from Sean Connery.

00:07:14.059 --> 00:07:15.977
Mm-hmm. Here you go.

00:07:16.728 --> 00:07:17.729
Oh, uh, um

00:07:17.812 --> 00:07:21.816
we have a coupon
for half-off appetizers.

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:24.486
It's at your tampa location,
but I called ahead.

00:07:24.569 --> 00:07:26.569
They said it's still in-state,
so they'd accept it.

00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:27.864
Oh, okay.

00:07:27.948 --> 00:07:29.991
And we'll split the rest
over these two cards here.

00:07:31.117 --> 00:07:32.410
Oh, oh, sorry.

00:07:32.494 --> 00:07:34.788
And I have one
for a complimentary dessert.

00:07:34.871 --> 00:07:35.997
So whenever you're ready,

00:07:36.081 --> 00:07:37.791
we'll take an oreo mess.

00:07:39.084 --> 00:07:40.085
Hey, thanks for dinner.

00:07:40.168 --> 00:07:41.711
Next year, it's gonna be
my treat.

00:07:41.795 --> 00:07:43.296
We're so proud of you, Dewey.

00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:45.131
(Speaking Samoan)

00:07:45.215 --> 00:07:47.217
(Speaking English)
We are a family of champions.

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:48.301
Yes, we are.

00:07:48.969 --> 00:07:51.054
I'm gonna work my ass off
all summer.

00:07:51.137 --> 00:07:53.014
Next year, I'm gonna dominate.

00:07:53.098 --> 00:07:55.725
From there, it's
a straight path to the NFL.

00:07:55.809 --> 00:07:57.477
Nobody's gonna outwork me.

00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:00.271
Your mess.

00:08:00.355 --> 00:08:02.232
(Gasps) All right.

00:08:02.315 --> 00:08:03.733
(Chuckles)

00:08:03.817 --> 00:08:05.735
What... whoa, whoa.
What y'all doing?

00:08:05.819 --> 00:08:06.820
Just_

00:08:08.113 --> 00:08:10.949
Adult Dwayne: That summer,
I took my training to the next level.

00:08:11.032 --> 00:08:13.785
(Rock music playing)

00:08:13.868 --> 00:08:15.912
(Panting)

00:08:18.164 --> 00:08:21.376
I've said before that the gym
has always been my sanctuary.

00:08:21.459 --> 00:08:23.253
Well, that summer,
it was my church,

00:08:23.336 --> 00:08:24.546
my altar to sweat,

00:08:24.629 --> 00:08:25.630
yo.

00:08:25.714 --> 00:08:27.007
You done with this machine yet?

00:08:27.549 --> 00:08:29.300
You see my towels
are still there, right?

00:08:30.010 --> 00:08:32.095
My basilica of grind.

00:08:32.178 --> 00:08:34.764
It was my workshop,
and I was its build-a-bear.

00:08:34.848 --> 00:08:36.450
Is there a better time
that I could call...

00:08:36.474 --> 00:08:37.767
As hard as I trained,

00:08:37.851 --> 00:08:39.131
the toughest part of that summer

00:08:39.185 --> 00:08:41.062
was when my mom got me
a job at her work

00:08:41.146 --> 00:08:42.564
so I could help out
with the bills.

00:08:42.647 --> 00:08:45.567
It's five nights in cabo,
all expenses included.

00:08:48.528 --> 00:08:49.529
(Vvhoops! Qaughs)

00:08:49.612 --> 00:08:51.172
Sorry about that.
My ear got too sweaty.

00:08:51.531 --> 00:08:54.743
Uh, as well as free t-shirts
from the giggling marlin.

00:08:54.826 --> 00:08:56.661
I hated seeing my mom
in that place.

00:08:57.078 --> 00:08:59.247
It was 100 degrees, no ac,

00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:01.124
and you only got paid
in commissions.

00:09:01.207 --> 00:09:02.459
It made me double down on

00:09:02.542 --> 00:09:04.335
my promise
to get her out of there,

00:09:04.419 --> 00:09:07.255
even if! Had to adjust
my expectations slightly.

00:09:07.338 --> 00:09:08.465
Reporter: All right, folks,

00:09:08.548 --> 00:09:10.633
our coverage
of the 1995 NFL draft

00:09:10.717 --> 00:09:12.260
continues now.

00:09:12.343 --> 00:09:14.137
We go to the 25th pick,

00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:17.223
Dwayne "my real name is Karen"
Johnson.

00:09:17.307 --> 00:09:18.492
If you don't get the reference,

00:09:18.516 --> 00:09:20.935
that's whoopi goldberg's
birth name.

00:09:21.019 --> 00:09:22.437
Okay, over to you.

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:23.521
Thanks, Chris.

00:09:23.605 --> 00:09:25.690
Dwayne, how does it feel
to be the 25th pick

00:09:25.774 --> 00:09:26.775
in the NFL draft?

00:09:26.858 --> 00:09:28.151
Well, it feels great.

00:09:28.234 --> 00:09:29.837
I'm gonna haunt the dreams
of the 24 teams

00:09:29.861 --> 00:09:31.488
that passed on me but...

00:09:31.571 --> 00:09:33.198
Oh, and one more thing.

00:09:33.281 --> 00:09:34.508
I bought my parents a tasteful,

00:09:34.532 --> 00:09:36.034
ranch-style home.

00:09:36.117 --> 00:09:38.244
Perfect, no stairs.

00:09:38.328 --> 00:09:39.496
Horizontal iivin'.

00:09:40.246 --> 00:09:42.606
Adult Dwayne: By the end
of the summer, I was ready to roll.

00:09:43.416 --> 00:09:45.585
I was gonna take
that intensity back to Miami

00:09:45.668 --> 00:09:47.962
and be the first guy
in the gym every morning.

00:09:48.046 --> 00:09:49.089
(Rock music playing)

00:09:54.886 --> 00:09:56.638
I was taking command
of my future.

00:09:59.432 --> 00:10:00.433
(Grunting)

00:10:00.517 --> 00:10:01.518
But, like I said,

00:10:01.601 --> 00:10:04.479
sometimes there are variables
you can't control.

00:10:04.562 --> 00:10:05.563
(Grunts)

00:10:05.688 --> 00:10:06.940
(Breathing heavily)

00:10:07.273 --> 00:10:08.566
Hey.

00:10:08.650 --> 00:10:10.026
(Grunts)

00:10:12.862 --> 00:10:14.656
Yo, Dwayne Johnson. D-line.

00:10:14.739 --> 00:10:16.241
Ray Lewis.

00:10:16.324 --> 00:10:17.325
Freshman linebacker.

00:10:24.791 --> 00:10:26.751
I thought I'd be the first
person here at 5:00 am.

00:10:26.876 --> 00:10:27.937
The assistant coach
I had to call

00:10:27.961 --> 00:10:29.504
to open up the weight room,

00:10:29.587 --> 00:10:30.627
he thought the same thing.

00:10:30.839 --> 00:10:32.090
(Ray panting)

00:10:32.173 --> 00:10:33.466
(Both chuckling)

00:10:33.883 --> 00:10:35.343
It's good to have some company.

00:10:35.426 --> 00:10:36.553
Man, hell yeah.

00:10:36.636 --> 00:10:38.680
The break of dawn boys.
Yeah, that's it.

00:10:38.763 --> 00:10:40.825
Hey, and let me know if you
have any questions about anything.

00:10:40.849 --> 00:10:42.183
My only question is,

00:10:43.143 --> 00:10:44.423
which way to
the starting lineup?

00:10:45.478 --> 00:10:47.564
Looks like you're gonna
fit in here just fine, ray.

00:10:48.314 --> 00:10:50.567
Reporter: Let's see what
they do here on second and long.

00:10:51.067 --> 00:10:53.027
(Crowd cheering)
A screen pass to Thomas.

00:10:53.611 --> 00:10:55.697
And ray Lewis said,
"I told you."

00:10:55.780 --> 00:10:57.365
(Both cheering)

00:10:58.199 --> 00:10:59.826
Man, that kid's unbelievable.

00:10:59.909 --> 00:11:01.077
Guy is a natural, brother.

00:11:01.161 --> 00:11:02.662
He was born in the back field.

00:11:02.745 --> 00:11:03.746
Hey, it's natural talent,

00:11:03.830 --> 00:11:05.081
but that guy's busting his ass

00:11:05.165 --> 00:11:07.292
in the gym with me
every morning.

00:11:07.375 --> 00:11:10.044
Man, I just wish I could
be out there with him.

00:11:10.128 --> 00:11:11.880
Nah, man, not me.

00:11:11.963 --> 00:11:14.174
I'm happy right
here on the sideline.

00:11:14.257 --> 00:11:15.758
No chance of injury,
and we still get

00:11:15.842 --> 00:11:17.069
the social juice
of being on the team.

00:11:17.093 --> 00:11:18.845
Social juice?
Who cares about social...

00:11:18.928 --> 00:11:19.929
Nah, man.

00:11:20.013 --> 00:11:21.306
This is my future.

00:11:21.389 --> 00:11:23.057
I just got to stay
ready, wait for my shot

00:11:23.141 --> 00:11:24.285
to show 'em what I'm capable of.

00:11:24.309 --> 00:11:26.269
I hear you, bro.
I'm just saying.

00:11:26.352 --> 00:11:28.272
Not all of us need to be
masters of the universe.

00:11:29.022 --> 00:11:30.064
Some of us are happy with

00:11:30.148 --> 00:11:31.524
middle management at state farm,

00:11:31.858 --> 00:11:33.458
with a cute wife
with a drinking problem.

00:11:33.526 --> 00:11:34.527
Carlos!

00:11:34.611 --> 00:11:35.838
That's my girl, Trish,
right there.

00:11:35.862 --> 00:11:37.447
Carlos, wave to me!

00:11:38.406 --> 00:11:39.782
I'm with Lisa!

00:11:39.866 --> 00:11:40.992
Hey, baby!

00:11:43.369 --> 00:11:44.913
No way I'm middle management.

00:11:45.705 --> 00:11:47.749
I'm gonna do big things.

00:11:47.832 --> 00:11:49.000
Dewey, you're in. Let's go.

00:11:49.167 --> 00:11:50.210
Ready, coach.

00:11:52.253 --> 00:11:53.880
(Ladies first playing)

00:11:53.963 --> 00:11:56.633
35 yards and a sack.
Down he goes. Dwayne Johnson.

00:11:56.716 --> 00:11:58.468
I read somewhere
he was thrown out of...

00:11:58.551 --> 00:12:01.012
267 poundjunior on...

00:12:01.095 --> 00:12:04.265
His father was a tag-team
champion back in 1984.

00:12:04.349 --> 00:12:05.642
Here comes the number one king.

00:12:05.725 --> 00:12:09.312
Marley is all over him
along with Johnson.

00:12:09.395 --> 00:12:11.814
Floyd is in. We 're done.

00:12:11.898 --> 00:12:13.399
(Crowd cheering)

00:12:13.983 --> 00:12:16.027
Number 94,

00:12:16.110 --> 00:12:17.445
Dwayne Johnson.

00:12:17.528 --> 00:12:19.781
Oh, it's my boy!

00:12:19.864 --> 00:12:21.658
(Laughing)

00:12:21.741 --> 00:12:23.660
Look at how old the
other team's coachis.

00:12:23.743 --> 00:12:24.911
Look like a grandpa!

00:12:24.994 --> 00:12:26.371
(Laughing) (Phone ringing)

00:12:26.913 --> 00:12:29.290
Babe, deweyjust made
an amazing play.

00:12:29.374 --> 00:12:32.293
He sacked the quarterback
who won the heisman trophy.

00:12:32.377 --> 00:12:33.795
Yes, that's great.

00:12:33.878 --> 00:12:34.939
Will you write down
the player's name

00:12:34.963 --> 00:12:36.256
so I can send his mother a note?

00:12:37.298 --> 00:12:38.299
Okay.

00:12:39.259 --> 00:12:40.927
Hey, you got a second, coach?

00:12:41.010 --> 00:12:42.178
Sure, Dewey. Take a seat.

00:12:42.262 --> 00:12:43.656
Adult Dwayne:
Even though / never started,

00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:46.349
I got some decent playing time
and made the most of it.

00:12:46.432 --> 00:12:48.851
I thought it might be enough
to get me noticed.

00:12:48.935 --> 00:12:50.287
I just wanted to ask
you about something.

00:12:50.311 --> 00:12:51.980
Girl advice?
Be straightforward, okay?

00:12:52.063 --> 00:12:53.356
Dothmynflndgames
oh, no, no, no_.

00:12:53.439 --> 00:12:54.583
Be a gentleman, open the door.

00:12:54.607 --> 00:12:56.150
No, it's not that. It's, um,

00:12:56.234 --> 00:12:58.194
well, I heard that NFL scouts

00:12:58.278 --> 00:13:00.571
usually ask for tape on
players they're interested in,

00:13:00.655 --> 00:13:03.408
and I was just curious
if you got any calls for me.

00:13:06.411 --> 00:13:07.596
You know, Dwayne, you're one of

00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:08.973
the hardest working guys
I've ever had here.

00:13:08.997 --> 00:13:10.331
You're a fine player.

00:13:10.415 --> 00:13:11.767
Hardest working
in the weight room,

00:13:11.791 --> 00:13:14.043
practice sessions,
film sessions.

00:13:14.127 --> 00:13:15.878
Hell, I wish half these guys

00:13:15.962 --> 00:13:17.242
had one-tenth
of your work ethic.

00:13:17.922 --> 00:13:18.923
Thank you, coach.

00:13:19.716 --> 00:13:21.259
Which is why I have
a question for you.

00:13:23.386 --> 00:13:25.346
You ever consider
going into coaching?

00:13:25.930 --> 00:13:28.016
Uh, what?

00:13:28.099 --> 00:13:29.618
You got the skillset
to be a great one.

00:13:29.642 --> 00:13:31.769
Dependable, diligent...

00:13:31.853 --> 00:13:33.187
And then he says

00:13:33.271 --> 00:13:34.939
I can do anything
I put my mind to.

00:13:35.023 --> 00:13:36.232
(All groaning)

00:13:36.316 --> 00:13:37.400
That's brutal, man.

00:13:37.483 --> 00:13:38.735
Man, somebody get my man here

00:13:38.818 --> 00:13:39.986
another drink, please.

00:13:40.069 --> 00:13:41.279
I mean, he called me dutiful.

00:13:41.362 --> 00:13:43.698
That's like what my
grandma calls my mom.

00:13:43.781 --> 00:13:44.949
That's real messed up.

00:13:45.116 --> 00:13:47.410
Has coach Erickson evercahed
any of you guys dutiful?

00:13:47.910 --> 00:13:48.911
All: Hell no.

00:13:48.995 --> 00:13:50.621
The last thing he called me was

00:13:50.705 --> 00:13:52.248
"a rolling ball
of butcher knives."

00:13:53.458 --> 00:13:54.542
Sapp!

00:13:54.625 --> 00:13:56.044
Hell of a game you played.

00:13:56.127 --> 00:13:58.046
Yo, what's up, uncle Luke, man!

00:13:58.129 --> 00:13:59.839
I appreciate it, man.
I appreciate it.

00:14:00.089 --> 00:14:04.093
And ray ray!
Freshman tackling machine.

00:14:04.177 --> 00:14:06.238
Yeah, I told y'all I was gonna
put a hurtin' on 'em, uncle I.

00:14:06.262 --> 00:14:07.502
Thatsack on third down was like

00:14:07.555 --> 00:14:09.390
the most beautiful thing
ieverseen.

00:14:09.474 --> 00:14:11.059
And I've witnessed
a bluebird hatching.

00:14:11.142 --> 00:14:12.143
(All laughing)

00:14:12.226 --> 00:14:13.394
Hello, Luther.

00:14:13.686 --> 00:14:16.064
Luther? You one of my
mama's work friends?

00:14:16.147 --> 00:14:17.148
(Chuckung)

00:14:17.231 --> 00:14:18.858
Hey, fellas. Quick question:

00:14:18.941 --> 00:14:20.610
What is black, white, and green?

00:14:20.693 --> 00:14:22.713
You guys, me, and all the
money we're gonna make together.

00:14:22.737 --> 00:14:23.946
All: Hey!

00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:25.073
I like the way he talking.

00:14:25.156 --> 00:14:26.324
Y'all know drew, right?

00:14:26.407 --> 00:14:28.326
Sports agent for the stars.

00:14:28.409 --> 00:14:29.729
Now when it's your turn
to go pro,

00:14:29.786 --> 00:14:31.996
he gon' make you
rich. That's right.

00:14:32.830 --> 00:14:34.040
Hey, man. How you doing?

00:14:34.707 --> 00:14:36.501
Him? Me?

00:14:36.584 --> 00:14:37.752
Yeah, you, big fella.

00:14:38.378 --> 00:14:40.046
Uh, yeah, good.
Great, glad to hear it.

00:14:40.129 --> 00:14:41.214
Mind if I sit down?

00:14:41.297 --> 00:14:42.673
Uh, yeah. Sure.

00:14:42.757 --> 00:14:44.437
All right, cool. I'll
just steal your seat.

00:14:49.055 --> 00:14:50.223
Yeah, yeah. You know, I was

00:14:50.306 --> 00:14:51.906
kinda running late
for this other meeting

00:14:51.974 --> 00:14:54.227
with this, uh, this other agent.

00:14:54.310 --> 00:14:56.020
All right,
I have everyone's number

00:14:56.104 --> 00:14:57.772
in this phone. Name someone.

00:14:57.855 --> 00:14:58.856
Kevin kline.

00:14:58.940 --> 00:14:59.941
Have it, boom!

00:15:00.316 --> 00:15:01.377
Ray: Yo, it's in that?
It's in that?

00:15:01.401 --> 00:15:02.652
Dude, that's crazy.

00:15:02.735 --> 00:15:04.615
If you said Phoebe cates,
then I'd be impressed.

00:15:04.654 --> 00:15:05.655
Phoebe cates?

00:15:05.738 --> 00:15:06.739
Boom, gotcha! (Cheering)

00:15:08.241 --> 00:15:09.801
Warren: He got Phoebe cates
in that mug!

00:15:11.327 --> 00:15:13.037
I've always believed
that no good happens

00:15:13.121 --> 00:15:14.288
without hard work.

00:15:14.372 --> 00:15:15.623
But sometimes accepting that

00:15:15.706 --> 00:15:17.625
that's still not enough,

00:15:17.708 --> 00:15:18.876
that's the tough one.

00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:20.396
So I take it things
didn't turn around

00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:21.546
your senior season?

00:15:21.629 --> 00:15:22.839
Well, you know, I played well.

00:15:22.922 --> 00:15:24.507
Butlnevergot the starting job,

00:15:24.590 --> 00:15:26.110
and before you know it,
just like that,

00:15:27.135 --> 00:15:28.535
my college football career
was over.

00:15:28.594 --> 00:15:31.472
And it felt like
my dreams were, too.

00:15:31.556 --> 00:15:33.683
And now let's talk
to Dwayne Johnson.

00:15:33.766 --> 00:15:35.393
Thanks, Reggie.
Dwayne, how does it feel

00:15:35.476 --> 00:15:36.978
to be "Mr. Irrelevant,"

00:15:37.061 --> 00:15:38.771
the last pick in the NFL draft?

00:15:38.896 --> 00:15:40.773
Reggie? Where's Chris berman?

00:15:40.857 --> 00:15:42.024
He left six rounds ago.

00:15:42.442 --> 00:15:44.202
He had tickets to
the unsinkable Molly brown.

00:15:45.736 --> 00:15:48.114
So, I bought you guys
a mobile home.

00:15:49.407 --> 00:15:51.075
The open road is my front yard.

00:15:51.159 --> 00:15:52.439
You should've
just kept the cash.

00:15:55.079 --> 00:15:58.040
Okay, guys, gather up.

00:15:58.124 --> 00:16:02.295
(Team cheers and applauds)

00:16:02.378 --> 00:16:03.671
Okay, we just have

00:16:03.754 --> 00:16:05.315
a couple of end-of-season
awards to give out,

00:16:05.339 --> 00:16:06.716
but, first, I just want to say

00:16:06.799 --> 00:16:09.093
thank you for all of your
effort and your sacrifice,

00:16:09.177 --> 00:16:10.303
especially our seniors.

00:16:10.386 --> 00:16:14.223
(Team applauding)

00:16:14.307 --> 00:16:16.476
So the mvp of our team this year

00:16:16.559 --> 00:16:18.559
was also the recipient
of the bronko nagurski award

00:16:18.603 --> 00:16:19.937
for best defensive player,

00:16:21.355 --> 00:16:23.733
the lombardi award
for best lineman,

00:16:24.775 --> 00:16:25.943
first team all-American,

00:16:26.027 --> 00:16:28.571
and the big east
defensive player of the year.

00:16:28.654 --> 00:16:31.949
We all look forward to watching
him next year play in the NFL,

00:16:32.033 --> 00:16:33.034
Warren sapp.

00:16:33.367 --> 00:16:37.580
(Team cheers and applauds)

00:16:37.663 --> 00:16:39.957
Appreciate you, coach.
Appreciate you.

00:16:40.041 --> 00:16:43.628
Yo, I just want to say
thank you to all of you

00:16:43.711 --> 00:16:46.088
for allowing me to outshine
y'all all these years.

00:16:46.172 --> 00:16:49.050
(Team groans and laughs)

00:16:50.009 --> 00:16:51.802
Warren sapp. (Team cheers)

00:16:51.886 --> 00:16:54.472
(Applauds)

00:16:54.555 --> 00:16:56.098
Okay, and the next award.

00:16:56.182 --> 00:16:57.284
Coming all the way back from

00:16:57.308 --> 00:16:59.018
academic probation to earn

00:16:59.101 --> 00:17:02.271
a 2.8 in general studies,

00:17:02.355 --> 00:17:04.106
scholar of the year,
Mr. Dwayne Johnson.

00:17:04.190 --> 00:17:07.318
(Team cheers)

00:17:10.988 --> 00:17:12.073
Dewey!

00:17:14.033 --> 00:17:15.701
Hey, coach, is this your dad?

00:17:15.785 --> 00:17:17.119
(Laughter)

00:17:17.203 --> 00:17:18.538
It's Benjamin Franklin, son.

00:17:18.621 --> 00:17:20.540
Oh, of course.
Doesn't look like you at all.

00:17:20.623 --> 00:17:22.792
(Team chuckles and cheers)

00:17:26.379 --> 00:17:27.564
Coach Erickson: All
right guys, we're out of here

00:17:27.588 --> 00:17:28.857
in three days.
I want everything packed...

00:17:28.881 --> 00:17:29.942
Adult Dwayne:
Like I've always done

00:17:29.966 --> 00:17:31.884
when I don't know
what else to do,

00:17:31.968 --> 00:17:33.094
I go home.

00:17:34.178 --> 00:17:35.263
My mom wasn't the only one

00:17:35.346 --> 00:17:37.223
who was grinding out a paycheck.

00:17:37.306 --> 00:17:39.183
My dad couldn't
book matches anymore,

00:17:39.267 --> 00:17:41.978
so he was teaching at
skinny Jimmy's wrestling camp.

00:17:42.061 --> 00:17:43.604
Does this hurt, Richard?

00:17:43.688 --> 00:17:45.898
No. Icanteu

00:17:45.982 --> 00:17:47.108
and so can the audience

00:17:47.191 --> 00:17:48.418
'cause you're not selling
worth a damn.

00:17:48.442 --> 00:17:49.443
Here, let me show you.

00:17:49.527 --> 00:17:50.861
Put me in a sleeper hold.

00:17:52.071 --> 00:17:54.031
(Choking)

00:17:54.115 --> 00:17:55.324
Oh, my god, are you okay?

00:17:55.408 --> 00:17:56.993
Richard, I swear to god.

00:17:57.243 --> 00:17:58.327
I'm selling.

00:17:58.619 --> 00:17:59.620
(Whispers) Right.

00:18:00.454 --> 00:18:02.248
That Richard is a disgrace.

00:18:02.331 --> 00:18:04.542
I wish I could go back in
time and kill his mother.

00:18:04.625 --> 00:18:06.085
At least he's having fun.

00:18:06.168 --> 00:18:07.968
He's got a good enough job
where he can afford

00:18:08.004 --> 00:18:09.130
to pay for these lessons.

00:18:09.213 --> 00:18:10.590
What does it matter if he's bad?

00:18:10.673 --> 00:18:11.775
All right, everybody.
Grab your partner.

00:18:11.799 --> 00:18:12.901
If it doesn't matter to him,

00:18:12.925 --> 00:18:14.260
itdoesnt matter to me.

00:18:15.177 --> 00:18:16.721
What matters to you, Dewey?

00:18:19.056 --> 00:18:20.057
What matters to me?

00:18:21.058 --> 00:18:22.059
Family.

00:18:23.144 --> 00:18:24.395
Doing something great.

00:18:24.770 --> 00:18:26.939
Proving that
I got what it takes.

00:18:27.023 --> 00:18:28.316
To do what?

00:18:28.399 --> 00:18:29.817
Whatever you got.

00:18:30.234 --> 00:18:32.820
(Chuckles) You remind
me of your grandfather.

00:18:32.903 --> 00:18:35.323
He would say the
same thing. He did?

00:18:35.406 --> 00:18:36.782
Everyone thought

00:18:36.866 --> 00:18:38.909
that he was too short
to be a wrestler,

00:18:38.993 --> 00:18:40.077
so he won the title.

00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:42.788
They thought that
wrestlers couldn't act,

00:18:42.872 --> 00:18:45.082
so he got cast
in a James Bond movie.

00:18:45.791 --> 00:18:47.793
And they thought
wrestlers were dumb,

00:18:47.877 --> 00:18:50.463
so he started
his own promotion business.

00:18:50.546 --> 00:18:52.840
He loved being underestimated.

00:18:53.466 --> 00:18:55.760
Yeah, I admire that.

00:18:56.927 --> 00:18:58.304
Wish I felt that way.

00:18:58.971 --> 00:18:59.972
Life is tough.

00:19:00.348 --> 00:19:01.724
You must be tougher.

00:19:02.350 --> 00:19:04.560
People don't believe in
your dream?

00:19:04.644 --> 00:19:06.687
Good. You prove them wrong.

00:19:08.397 --> 00:19:10.983
But what if they're right
and I'm the one that's wrong?

00:19:11.067 --> 00:19:12.652
You are not wrong.

00:19:12.735 --> 00:19:14.820
You're going to
take us with you.

00:19:14.904 --> 00:19:15.905
I know that.

00:19:16.530 --> 00:19:17.740
You never give up.

00:19:18.491 --> 00:19:20.201
We are all going to make it.

00:19:23.537 --> 00:19:26.540
Time to go on a cool-down walk
so I don't choke out Richard.

00:19:26.624 --> 00:19:28.584
He got drunk and promised
his kid that he'd fight

00:19:28.668 --> 00:19:30.795
the ultimate warrior
at next year's wrestlemania.

00:19:31.754 --> 00:19:34.465
I'm gonna head down to the
beach with my tire. Do some training.

00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:36.133
I thought football was over.

00:19:36.217 --> 00:19:38.386
The season's over, but
the NFL combine's coming up.

00:19:39.178 --> 00:19:41.222
Got to make sure I put
on a show for those scouts.

00:19:43.099 --> 00:19:44.767
Is that my championship ring?

00:19:44.850 --> 00:19:47.019
Oh, I like to wear it
to the store.

00:19:47.895 --> 00:19:49.438
Adult Dwayne:
So, yeah, sometimes

00:19:49.522 --> 00:19:52.733
there are things in life
you just can't control,

00:19:52.817 --> 00:19:54.944
but my family was
never a variable.

00:19:55.027 --> 00:19:59.657
Okay, try this again. Richard...

00:19:59.740 --> 00:20:01.200
They were always there.

00:20:02.952 --> 00:20:05.913
(Upbeat music playing)

00:20:14.380 --> 00:20:15.965
So we provide a
discount on a rental car

00:20:16.048 --> 00:20:17.967
if you commit to
a midsize or above.

00:20:19.093 --> 00:20:21.453
Uh, sorry, I'm just gonna have
to place you on a brief hold.

00:20:21.512 --> 00:20:22.752
Dewey, what are you doing here?

00:20:22.847 --> 00:20:24.390
Just dropped by
to bring you this.

00:20:24.515 --> 00:20:25.725
(Sighs softly)

00:20:25.808 --> 00:20:27.810
Might not be able
to get you out of here yet,

00:20:27.893 --> 00:20:29.538
but in the meantime,
I can at least make you

00:20:29.562 --> 00:20:30.730
a little more comfortable.

00:20:31.397 --> 00:20:33.649
Hey, why's she the only
one who gets one of those?

00:20:33.774 --> 00:20:35.085
Don't worry
about what she's getting.

00:20:35.109 --> 00:20:36.420
Know your role
and shut your mouth.

00:20:36.444 --> 00:20:37.445
Get out of here, Carl.

00:20:37.903 --> 00:20:39.113
Who's that chiming-in bitch?

00:20:39.196 --> 00:20:40.197
Carl.

00:20:41.157 --> 00:20:42.283
Thank you for the fan, baby.

00:20:43.617 --> 00:20:44.618
I love you.

00:20:45.411 --> 00:20:48.414
Hey, it might take
a little longer,

00:20:48.497 --> 00:20:49.832
but I'm getting
to the pros, mom.

00:20:51.208 --> 00:20:52.251
We're gonna make it.

00:20:53.169 --> 00:20:54.336
You know, for four years,

00:20:54.420 --> 00:20:56.380
I had gone up against
future hall-of-famers.

00:20:56.464 --> 00:20:57.944
And I was good,
but I was never great.

00:20:58.340 --> 00:21:00.235
But I still thought I was
good enough to get a shot,

00:21:00.259 --> 00:21:01.510
and all I needed was

00:21:01.594 --> 00:21:03.929
one NFL team who believed in me.

00:21:04.013 --> 00:21:06.640
So did an NFL team take a
chance on you? Did you get drafted?

00:21:07.683 --> 00:21:09.977
Well, we'll save that story
for another time.

00:21:10.060 --> 00:21:11.204
Oh, okay, I can't
wait. (Bothlaugh)

00:21:11.228 --> 00:21:12.229
It's a good one.

00:21:12.313 --> 00:21:14.040
Yeah, I won't have the
hard pear cider next time.

00:21:14.064 --> 00:21:15.065
Cheers.

00:21:15.149 --> 00:21:16.150
Oh, yes, um...

00:21:22.615 --> 00:21:24.158
There you go.

00:21:24.241 --> 00:21:26.076
Get it.

00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:28.037
(Loveit flaughs)
