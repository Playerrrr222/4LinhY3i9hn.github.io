00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:08.509
(News music playing)

00:00:14.223 --> 00:00:15.974
Good afternoon.
I'm Randall park,

00:00:16.058 --> 00:00:17.809
live at the campaign
headquarters

00:00:17.893 --> 00:00:20.479
of presidential candidate
Dwayne Johnson.

00:00:21.021 --> 00:00:22.332
Randall, it's good
to have you here, buddy.

00:00:22.356 --> 00:00:24.525
Well, it's all
my "plejure." Pleasure.

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:27.069
Did I say "plejure"?
(Both chuckling)

00:00:27.444 --> 00:00:29.238
Uh, yeah, can we do that over?

00:00:29.321 --> 00:00:30.632
I just needed
a second to warm up.

00:00:30.656 --> 00:00:32.741
Mmm-hmm, we're live.

00:00:32.824 --> 00:00:35.077
Oh. (Laughs nervously)

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.413
Yes, of course, we are live.

00:00:38.622 --> 00:00:41.750
It's been a while
since my live theater days,

00:00:41.833 --> 00:00:44.211
since I played mercutio
in Romeo and Juliet.

00:00:44.294 --> 00:00:46.880
"True, I talk of dreams,
which are the children

00:00:46.964 --> 00:00:48.590
"of an idle brain,

00:00:48.715 --> 00:00:52.928
"begot of nothing
but vain fantasy."

00:00:54.888 --> 00:00:57.558
Yes, yes.
"And thusly the night."

00:00:57.891 --> 00:01:00.477
I had the skull,
and I was, like,

00:01:00.561 --> 00:01:02.604
"uh, you're a skull."

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:04.690
We're live. We're... we're live.

00:01:04.773 --> 00:01:06.316
We're still live. Ye... oh, yes.

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:07.818
We are still live. That's right.

00:01:07.901 --> 00:01:10.028
So, we've heard rumblings
that you're close

00:01:10.112 --> 00:01:11.530
to choosing your vp.

00:01:11.613 --> 00:01:13.373
We're very excited
to make that announcement.

00:01:13.407 --> 00:01:14.847
Pretty soon
we're gonna tell america.

00:01:15.033 --> 00:01:16.618
So what are
the important qualities

00:01:16.702 --> 00:01:18.342
that you're looking for
in a running mate?

00:01:18.912 --> 00:01:21.415
Do you remember that story
I told you about the incident?

00:01:21.498 --> 00:01:23.083
The one with
Jack black and the cows.

00:01:23.417 --> 00:01:24.710
Can't get it out of my mind.

00:01:24.793 --> 00:01:26.396
Not that one,
although that's a great story.

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:27.897
I'm talking about the one
where I punched that kid

00:01:27.921 --> 00:01:29.423
in high school. Yes.

00:01:29.673 --> 00:01:32.551
I will never forget it.
I was 15 years old,

00:01:32.634 --> 00:01:34.720
and clearly I was no angel.

00:01:34.928 --> 00:01:37.681
But up until that time, I'd
always kept my bad behavior

00:01:37.764 --> 00:01:40.475
away from my parents.
Not this time.

00:01:40.559 --> 00:01:42.561
My dad was away
at a wrestling convention,

00:01:42.644 --> 00:01:44.229
and my mom found out.

00:01:44.563 --> 00:01:46.040
Stephanie: Keep those
knees up, jazzers!

00:01:46.064 --> 00:01:47.899
E veryone's watching

00:01:47.983 --> 00:01:50.193
ata, I can't believe
this is your first class.

00:01:50.611 --> 00:01:52.029
You're a natural.

00:01:52.112 --> 00:01:53.530
To see what you will do

00:01:53.614 --> 00:01:54.656
I'm dying.

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:55.824
E veryon e's trying

00:01:55.907 --> 00:02:00.078
to get it right get it right

00:02:00.412 --> 00:02:03.832
e verybody's working
for the weekend

00:02:03.957 --> 00:02:04.958
(school bell rings)

00:02:05.167 --> 00:02:06.710
Principal Bogg, I'm shocked.

00:02:06.793 --> 00:02:08.771
Dewey has never done
anything like this in his life.

00:02:08.795 --> 00:02:10.047
He's a good boy.

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.549
No one is more shocked than me.

00:02:12.633 --> 00:02:15.135
I thought for sure
Dwayne was an undercover cop.

00:02:15.218 --> 00:02:17.846
I was this close to asking him
to an eagles game.

00:02:18.388 --> 00:02:20.182
So what exactly happened?

00:02:20.265 --> 00:02:21.433
I was provoked.

00:02:21.516 --> 00:02:23.685
Wrestling's all fake anyway.

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:25.896
(Grunts) Om

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:28.106
never use the "f" word.

00:02:28.607 --> 00:02:30.126
Principal Bogg: Well, that's
one side of the story.

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.861
Normally, we'd get the other
side from the boy he hit,

00:02:32.944 --> 00:02:34.255
but he was rushed
to the hospital.

00:02:34.279 --> 00:02:36.114
Oh, mygom vveh, notrushed.

00:02:36.198 --> 00:02:38.033
He was taken
at a comfortable speed.

00:02:38.533 --> 00:02:40.786
Sort of a relaxed urgency,
wouldn't you say, Helen?

00:02:40.952 --> 00:02:43.038
Helen: I'd say more
composed than relaxed.

00:02:43.288 --> 00:02:45.707
Composed urgency. Are
you sure it was Dewey?

00:02:45.791 --> 00:02:47.542
The victim ID'd him.

00:02:47.626 --> 00:02:50.754
Is your attacker in this lineup?

00:02:51.046 --> 00:02:52.130
Thatone.

00:02:52.214 --> 00:02:53.215
The ogre.

00:02:53.298 --> 00:02:54.716
You know we can hear you, right?

00:02:54.841 --> 00:02:57.177
I guess we can just
call people ogres now.

00:02:57.302 --> 00:03:01.139
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to
suspend Dwayne for a week.

00:03:01.598 --> 00:03:05.060
I can assure you, nothing
like this will ever happen again.

00:03:05.352 --> 00:03:06.770
Right, Dewey?

00:03:06.937 --> 00:03:08.855
Where'd you get those pants?

00:03:16.196 --> 00:03:17.239
In p.E. Class.

00:03:17.322 --> 00:03:18.699
We had a push-up contest,

00:03:18.782 --> 00:03:20.062
and the winner
got girbaud jeans.

00:03:20.283 --> 00:03:23.286
Specifically that pair or did
you have to give your size?

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.497
You know what, forget it.
I don't have the energy.

00:03:25.622 --> 00:03:28.583
Get your homework for
the week. I'll be outside.

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:30.961
Ow, my legs.

00:03:33.171 --> 00:03:34.881
Dude, this is a
huge moment for you.

00:03:35.424 --> 00:03:38.218
What do you mean? Fine-ass Karen
liked that you punched Kevin, man.

00:03:38.301 --> 00:03:40.154
Said it made her feel like
cherry from outsiders.

00:03:40.178 --> 00:03:41.596
For real?
Like, she told you that?

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.056
Well, not exactly.

00:03:43.223 --> 00:03:44.784
Karen wrote a note
that she gave to Bonnie,

00:03:44.808 --> 00:03:46.577
and Bonnie gave that note
to me to give to you,

00:03:46.601 --> 00:03:48.081
and as you know,
I'm a curious George,

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:50.939
so I read it immediately
before handing it to you

00:03:51.022 --> 00:03:53.233
right now.

00:03:53.442 --> 00:03:54.860
Gabe: "That punch was hot.

00:03:54.943 --> 00:03:57.296
"If you want, you can buy me a
present and take me to dinner.

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:58.822
"00. Those are just the hugs.

00:03:59.156 --> 00:04:01.074
"If you want the xx kisses,

00:04:01.158 --> 00:04:02.242
"let's see that gift.

00:04:02.492 --> 00:04:04.536
"Karen."

00:04:04.745 --> 00:04:05.787
I memorized it.

00:04:05.954 --> 00:04:07.122
She thinks I'm rich,

00:04:07.205 --> 00:04:09.166
solgofia get her a dope present.

00:04:09.541 --> 00:04:11.102
Come with me to the mall
later, help me find one?

00:04:11.126 --> 00:04:12.669
Okay, sure.
Where do you wanna meet?

00:04:12.753 --> 00:04:13.962
Zales. Obviously zales.

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:15.449
I don't even know
why I said that.

00:04:15.547 --> 00:04:17.187
Dewey, let's go! We're
gonna miss the bus!

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:20.552
Dewey, the bus.

00:04:25.223 --> 00:04:26.558
I can't beheve this.

00:04:27.058 --> 00:04:28.898
Wait till I tell your father
when he gets home.

00:04:29.019 --> 00:04:31.659
Did you have to broadcast to the
whole school that we take the bus?

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:34.566
You just got suspended, and
that's what you're concerned about?

00:04:34.649 --> 00:04:36.443
Everybody on here
is taking the bus.

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:37.986
That guy's probably a lawyer.

00:04:39.738 --> 00:04:42.240
Sorry. Are you talking to me?

00:04:42.616 --> 00:04:44.743
No. Uh...

00:04:48.914 --> 00:04:50.665
Let's focus on
the real issue here.

00:04:50.749 --> 00:04:51.875
Why did you hit that boy?

00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:53.293
He was talking trash about us.

00:04:53.376 --> 00:04:55.271
He said that wrestling
was fake, so I punched him.

00:04:55.295 --> 00:04:56.922
That is not okay.

00:04:57.005 --> 00:04:58.757
You've never done
anything like this before.

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:00.735
Can we not talk about this
in front of all these people?

00:05:00.759 --> 00:05:02.844
No one is listening
to our conversation.

00:05:03.136 --> 00:05:06.306
Uh, actually, I am listening.

00:05:06.473 --> 00:05:09.476
I went through something
similar with my oldest.

00:05:09.559 --> 00:05:10.977
Okay, too much bus for me.

00:05:11.061 --> 00:05:12.479
What are you doing?

00:05:12.562 --> 00:05:14.105
This isn't our stop.

00:05:14.189 --> 00:05:16.024
I'm gonna go to the mall,
wait for Gabe.

00:05:16.191 --> 00:05:18.026
You certainly are not.
You just got suspended.

00:05:18.151 --> 00:05:19.569
Exactly. I can't be atschool

00:05:19.653 --> 00:05:21.488
so what does it matter
where I am? Dewey.

00:05:23.657 --> 00:05:24.950
(Sighs)

00:05:25.033 --> 00:05:26.535
Whoo! The party's here.

00:05:26.618 --> 00:05:28.370
(Drumming)

00:05:34.376 --> 00:05:35.836
(Line ringing)

00:05:37.754 --> 00:05:39.005
Hello, ata.

00:05:39.089 --> 00:05:40.757
How'd you know it was me?
Caller ID.

00:05:40.841 --> 00:05:42.641
I just got a whole new
phone system hooked up.

00:05:42.801 --> 00:05:43.885
I'm trying to find rocky.

00:05:44.219 --> 00:05:46.539
He left this morning to work
a wrestling convention in erie

00:05:46.596 --> 00:05:47.740
and didn't know
where he was staying.

00:05:47.764 --> 00:05:49.015
Is everything okay?

00:05:49.099 --> 00:05:50.618
(Sighs) Dewey got suspended
for fighting.

00:05:50.642 --> 00:05:52.394
(Gasps) I know.

00:05:52.477 --> 00:05:53.704
And then, when
I was taking him home,

00:05:53.728 --> 00:05:55.039
he got off the bus
to go to the mall.

00:05:55.063 --> 00:05:56.147
To buy you an apology gift?

00:05:56.481 --> 00:05:58.191
To hang out
with his friend Gabe.

00:05:58.275 --> 00:06:00.193
Gabe? I've never
met a Gabe in my life.

00:06:00.277 --> 00:06:01.637
That's why
I want to talk to rocky.

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:04.489
Dewey's such a sweet boy. He's
never acted out like this before.

00:06:04.573 --> 00:06:06.157
The wild Samoans
will know where he is.

00:06:06.241 --> 00:06:07.576
Here, I'll loop them in.

00:06:07.868 --> 00:06:10.245
I just got three-way
calling. Watch.

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:14.040
(Dial pad beeping)
(Line ringing)

00:06:14.124 --> 00:06:15.500
Hello. Hey, man,
it's me and ata.

00:06:15.584 --> 00:06:17.252
You know where rocky is
out there in erie?

00:06:17.544 --> 00:06:19.629
No, brother, but
macho man might know.

00:06:19.796 --> 00:06:23.592
Sika, can we add a three-way
call to a three-way call?

00:06:28.054 --> 00:06:29.306
Yes.

00:06:29.472 --> 00:06:31.182
Ooh, no, sorry.

00:06:31.266 --> 00:06:33.977
I'm actually on vacation
parasailing with Elizabeth.

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:36.521
You know what. Though,
let me try Andre, yeah.

00:06:36.605 --> 00:06:38.231
I saw rocky last night. Oh?

00:06:38.315 --> 00:06:41.067
In a dream. He was
a baby. (Laughs)

00:06:41.151 --> 00:06:42.611
Okay, I really need
to talk to him.

00:06:42.694 --> 00:06:44.547
Ata, I don't want to put
words in rocky's mouth,

00:06:44.571 --> 00:06:46.323
but I think I know
what he'd say.

00:06:46.698 --> 00:06:47.741
Boys test boundaries,

00:06:47.824 --> 00:06:49.468
and you've got to show
him that it's not okay.

00:06:49.492 --> 00:06:50.535
I agree.

00:06:50.619 --> 00:06:52.900
You need to bring the hammer
down and nip this in the bud.

00:06:53.204 --> 00:06:54.915
Yeah, you got this, ata.

00:06:54.998 --> 00:06:56.541
You're the boss. Oh, yeah!

00:06:56.666 --> 00:06:58.585
Dig it, yeah! You are a lioness.

00:06:58.877 --> 00:07:00.813
Let them hear you roar.
(Incoming call tone sounds)

00:07:00.837 --> 00:07:02.589
Oh, I've got another call.

00:07:02.672 --> 00:07:05.258
Hey, it's Stephanie
from jazzercize.

00:07:05.592 --> 00:07:08.303
You signed up for an
afternoon class and didn't show.

00:07:08.386 --> 00:07:11.473
Ata, I didn't know you did
jazzercise. Oh, it is so good for you.

00:07:11.556 --> 00:07:13.516
Sorry, Stephanie.
You're on a conference call.

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:15.101
Yeah, ata's son
disrespected her,

00:07:15.185 --> 00:07:16.625
but she's gonna
handle it on her own.

00:07:16.811 --> 00:07:18.647
For sure. Right.

00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:20.732
He's gonna try and test me? No.

00:07:20.857 --> 00:07:23.026
And? I'm the boss of that boy!

00:07:23.109 --> 00:07:24.361
I am a lioness!

00:07:24.694 --> 00:07:26.780
(All exclaiming and cheering
simultaneously)

00:07:27.072 --> 00:07:30.116
I love how
supportive this call is.

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:32.869
While the room's hot,
any advice what I should say

00:07:32.953 --> 00:07:34.621
to my sister when
she asks for money?

00:07:36.581 --> 00:07:38.708
(Sighs) I'll just tell her
I'm broke.

00:07:42.963 --> 00:07:45.048
Oh, that's the stuff
Karen likes.

00:07:45.131 --> 00:07:47.634
Pink ice. Yeah, how do you know?

00:07:47.717 --> 00:07:49.094
Karen told Bonnie,
Bonnie told me.

00:07:49.177 --> 00:07:50.762
Oh, me and Bonnie
are dating now, man.

00:07:50.845 --> 00:07:52.907
She liked the way I handled
the whole note passing thing.

00:07:52.931 --> 00:07:55.266
Dude, that's great. Yo, we
should all go on a double date.

00:07:55.350 --> 00:07:57.560
That would be amazing.
Yo, we could do our bits, man.

00:07:57.644 --> 00:07:59.813
Ooh, yeah, after this let's
cruise through chess king

00:07:59.896 --> 00:08:01.776
so we can five-finger discount
some new outfits.

00:08:02.899 --> 00:08:03.942
Yes, hello.

00:08:04.025 --> 00:08:05.193
Pink ice.

00:08:05.318 --> 00:08:07.028
Your ladies have
exquisite taste.

00:08:07.112 --> 00:08:08.238
Oh, not me.

00:08:08.321 --> 00:08:10.681
Mine wants a chunky necklace
from some place called chico's.

00:08:11.032 --> 00:08:13.034
How much is this one?

00:08:13.284 --> 00:08:15.286
That's $99.99.

00:08:16.496 --> 00:08:17.682
Do you have anything
that looks like

00:08:17.706 --> 00:08:20.000
it starts with a nine but
actually starts with a two?

00:08:20.083 --> 00:08:22.669
Let me show you
our most affordable option.

00:08:23.044 --> 00:08:26.089
The stud earrings. There you go.

00:08:29.467 --> 00:08:30.510
I don't see anything.

00:08:30.593 --> 00:08:32.262
Here, let me help you.

00:08:34.472 --> 00:08:36.683
Gabe: There. There it is.
Do you see it? There.

00:08:36.808 --> 00:08:38.560
Ata: Dewey! Uh...

00:08:39.144 --> 00:08:41.396
How dare you get off that
bus and walk away from me?

00:08:41.479 --> 00:08:44.649
As far as you're concerned, I
am the law and you will obey me.

00:08:44.733 --> 00:08:46.752
Mom, we're in zales. I
don't care if we're in zales.

00:08:46.776 --> 00:08:48.111
You are grounded for two months.

00:08:48.236 --> 00:08:49.676
Two months?
And don't think grounding

00:08:49.738 --> 00:08:51.458
means you're gonna
watch TV and eat waffles.

00:08:51.531 --> 00:08:53.259
You're coming with me.
I'm putting you to work.

00:08:53.283 --> 00:08:54.576
Okay, just calm down.

00:08:54.659 --> 00:08:56.745
Do you think you can just
tell me to calm down?

00:08:57.162 --> 00:08:59.748
Well, I... it doesn't
matter what you think!

00:08:59.831 --> 00:09:01.041
Come on, let's go.

00:09:01.833 --> 00:09:03.436
And you better be looking
at those earrings

00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:05.503
as an apology gift for me.

00:09:05.587 --> 00:09:06.629
You can see those?

00:09:07.047 --> 00:09:08.590
I see everything.

00:09:13.845 --> 00:09:16.973
Ata: You're not done till I can
see my face in the reflection.

00:09:17.057 --> 00:09:19.059
Yes, ma'am. I'm impressed.

00:09:19.309 --> 00:09:21.061
I tried disciplining
my daughter once

00:09:21.144 --> 00:09:23.480
when she crashed her Audi,
but then she crashed my Audi.

00:09:23.646 --> 00:09:24.939
And now we're down to one Audi.

00:09:25.023 --> 00:09:26.500
After we finish here,
I'm taking Dewey

00:09:26.524 --> 00:09:28.026
to apologize to the boy he hit.

00:09:28.234 --> 00:09:31.029
Making amends.
Oh, that reminds me.

00:09:31.112 --> 00:09:32.465
Did you see
the Sally jessy episode

00:09:32.489 --> 00:09:33.716
about people who talk to ghosts?

00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:35.116
No, I was hoping
you recorded it.

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:36.993
Oh, I did, and it's a doozy.

00:09:37.118 --> 00:09:39.287
I'll get the tape
for you right after

00:09:39.370 --> 00:09:41.289
I write you a check
for the week.

00:09:42.207 --> 00:09:44.793
Is that pug dog a purse? Yes.

00:09:44.876 --> 00:09:46.419
Don't you love?
It's Judith leiber.

00:09:46.503 --> 00:09:49.047
She makes Jewel-encrusted bags
shaped like fun things.

00:09:49.214 --> 00:09:50.381
(Imitates barking)

00:09:50.632 --> 00:09:53.218
I've got the frog,
the sleeping cat.

00:09:53.301 --> 00:09:56.346
And I'm on the waitlist
for the pork chop.

00:09:56.429 --> 00:09:58.431
Oh, they're gorgeous.

00:09:58.515 --> 00:09:59.766
Like feminine trophies.

00:09:59.849 --> 00:10:01.601
Mmm-hmm.
Dwayne, grab some Polish

00:10:01.684 --> 00:10:03.853
and give this purse shelf
a once-over.

00:10:03.937 --> 00:10:06.272
But I'm mopping. After you mop.

00:10:06.481 --> 00:10:07.690
Yes, ma'am.

00:10:08.024 --> 00:10:10.860
The "ma'am" is everything.

00:10:11.778 --> 00:10:13.464
Young Dwayne: "I'm sorry for
what I did to you.

00:10:13.488 --> 00:10:14.548
"And I know saying I'm sorry

00:10:14.572 --> 00:10:17.283
"doesn't excuse the pain
that I've caused you, Kevin.

00:10:17.367 --> 00:10:18.576
"But I hope in a small way

00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:20.662
"it can be a part
of the healing process,

00:10:20.912 --> 00:10:23.581
"and I hope one day
you and your family

00:10:23.665 --> 00:10:25.208
"will be able to forgive me.

00:10:25.291 --> 00:10:26.501
"I know itwill be some time

00:10:26.584 --> 00:10:28.294
"before I'm able
to forgive myself.

00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:32.215
"Sincerely,
Dwayne Douglas Johnson."

00:10:32.507 --> 00:10:34.717
Thank you for that,
Dwayne Douglas.

00:10:35.135 --> 00:10:37.887
And, yes, I do forgive you.

00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:40.460
I'm proud of you for doing that.

00:10:40.515 --> 00:10:41.599
Thanks, mom.

00:10:41.683 --> 00:10:43.268
That was lovely.

00:10:43.351 --> 00:10:45.436
His father and I
prayed for this moment.

00:10:46.146 --> 00:10:48.648
Thank you. I have to say,
I'm impressed with how well

00:10:48.731 --> 00:10:50.692
you're handling all this
as a single mom.

00:10:51.192 --> 00:10:53.236
I have a husband.
I'm not a single mom.

00:10:53.319 --> 00:10:55.572
Oh, I just assumed.
You assumed because I'm...

00:10:55.655 --> 00:10:57.615
Oh, heavens no. No, not at all.

00:10:57.782 --> 00:10:59.576
No, no. No.

00:11:00.034 --> 00:11:01.744
What did you think
I was gonna say?

00:11:03.746 --> 00:11:06.291
What were you gonna say?

00:11:06.374 --> 00:11:07.750
Young. Exactly.

00:11:07.834 --> 00:11:09.874
No, you don't seem that
young, is what I was saying.

00:11:11.212 --> 00:11:13.298
But you're youthful.
(Clears throat)

00:11:17.468 --> 00:11:18.928
Sorry again, bro.

00:11:20.597 --> 00:11:23.558
My dad prayed to god
to damn your soul to hell.

00:11:23.641 --> 00:11:26.686
What? God owes my dad a favor,

00:11:26.769 --> 00:11:28.688
and for that favor he asked god

00:11:28.771 --> 00:11:30.565
to curse your soul
to eternal damnation

00:11:30.648 --> 00:11:31.816
for laying hands on me.

00:11:33.651 --> 00:11:35.320
Just thought you should know.

00:11:39.032 --> 00:11:40.491
Gabe: Eternal damnation?

00:11:40.783 --> 00:11:42.160
That's a bitch move.

00:11:42.243 --> 00:11:44.579
Getting his preacher dad
to use his powers like that.

00:11:44.662 --> 00:11:47.141
My mom said not to sweat it
'cause she thinks his dad's a racist.

00:11:47.165 --> 00:11:49.125
By the way, your mom
was like a total badass.

00:11:49.459 --> 00:11:51.353
Me and the zales guy
talked about it for a while.

00:11:51.377 --> 00:11:53.588
Also, I learned some, like,
cool stuff about zales.

00:11:53.922 --> 00:11:55.882
I have never seen her like that.

00:11:55.965 --> 00:11:57.885
My dad is usually the one
that gets all riled up.

00:11:57.926 --> 00:11:59.528
Do you think you can get out
of being grounded tonight?

00:11:59.552 --> 00:12:00.970
Because I talked to Bonnie,

00:12:01.054 --> 00:12:02.854
and the four of us
are doing that double date.

00:12:03.264 --> 00:12:06.059
Yeah, I'm gonna tell my mom I'm
going to bed early then sneak out.

00:12:06.142 --> 00:12:07.810
Where are we going?
T.J. Crispy's.

00:12:08.478 --> 00:12:10.313
Want to see the present
I got her?

00:12:14.234 --> 00:12:17.320
What is it?
It's a marble egg, man.

00:12:17.403 --> 00:12:19.405
What does it do? Look expensive.

00:12:19.822 --> 00:12:21.532
What is that, a marble egg?

00:12:21.616 --> 00:12:22.992
Looks expensive.

00:12:23.076 --> 00:12:25.912
Thank you. You get
Karen a present yet?

00:12:26.204 --> 00:12:28.498
Yeah, I got her
something real nice.

00:12:53.690 --> 00:12:56.484
What?

00:12:59.862 --> 00:13:00.947
(Sighs)

00:13:04.367 --> 00:13:06.411
Ata, what are you doing here?

00:13:06.494 --> 00:13:08.496
I watched that Sally jessy
episode you gave me.

00:13:08.579 --> 00:13:10.059
I needed to talk
about it immediately.

00:13:10.206 --> 00:13:11.406
The part where the ghost says,

00:13:11.457 --> 00:13:14.627
"I am Jackie, and I
forgive you, ' goosebumps.

00:13:14.711 --> 00:13:16.591
Then the phone rang,
and I almost peed my pants.

00:13:16.629 --> 00:13:17.922
(Bothlaugh)

00:13:18.047 --> 00:13:19.465
Well, I brought wine.

00:13:19.549 --> 00:13:21.634
So, if you got a corkscrew
and two glasses,

00:13:21.718 --> 00:13:25.263
I'll just wait here.
Oh, yellow hill.

00:13:27.598 --> 00:13:30.351
Listen, ata, I'm walking
into the kitchen

00:13:30.435 --> 00:13:32.687
and I'm not gonna
bring out your wine.

00:13:32.770 --> 00:13:34.856
I'm sorry, but I think
we'd both be happier

00:13:34.939 --> 00:13:36.983
drinking one of my grenaches.

00:13:37.066 --> 00:13:38.359
It's from France.

00:13:38.484 --> 00:13:40.028
Yours says it's from Nevada,

00:13:40.111 --> 00:13:41.696
and I'm just
not familiar with...

00:13:41.779 --> 00:13:42.905
What are you doing?

00:13:44.449 --> 00:13:46.492
I was... this fell.

00:13:46.576 --> 00:13:48.411
The shelf must be wobbly
and it slid off,

00:13:48.494 --> 00:13:50.747
or I don't know what made it
fall, but it fell, and...

00:13:52.749 --> 00:13:54.250
Dwayne stole it. What?

00:13:54.334 --> 00:13:55.811
He took it, and I was
trying to put it back.

00:13:55.835 --> 00:13:57.795
I am so sorry.
I'm so embarrassed.

00:13:57.962 --> 00:13:59.023
I didn't even want to tell you,

00:13:59.047 --> 00:14:01.799
but obviously I'm not as good
a liar as my son.

00:14:02.175 --> 00:14:04.635
Well, why would he do that?
I don't know.

00:14:04.719 --> 00:14:06.137
Dewey's always been
such a good kid,

00:14:06.220 --> 00:14:09.265
but now he's punching
people, disobeying me, stealing.

00:14:09.390 --> 00:14:12.060
At first I thought this isn't
like him, but what if it is?

00:14:12.143 --> 00:14:13.770
What if this is
who he really is?

00:14:15.855 --> 00:14:18.441
There is a difference between
good kids who make mistakes

00:14:18.524 --> 00:14:20.651
and kids like my daughter,

00:14:20.777 --> 00:14:22.653
who just wanna
watch the world burn.

00:14:23.821 --> 00:14:25.156
I don't know your son,

00:14:25.239 --> 00:14:27.158
but I feel like
I've gotten to know you.

00:14:27.492 --> 00:14:29.243
You raised a good kid.

00:14:30.203 --> 00:14:32.330
Thanks for saying that,
but I honestly don't feel

00:14:32.413 --> 00:14:34.165
like I'm doing
a good job at all.

00:14:34.248 --> 00:14:36.008
I thought being stricter
with him would help,

00:14:36.042 --> 00:14:37.710
but it hasn't.

00:14:37.794 --> 00:14:40.546
I just want to talk to rocky.
He'd know what to do.

00:14:41.714 --> 00:14:43.674
I think you know what to do.

00:14:44.342 --> 00:14:47.261
Do you remember that Sally episode
we watched about Princess syndrome?

00:14:47.595 --> 00:14:49.239
You're just waiting
for someone to come along

00:14:49.263 --> 00:14:51.557
and rescue you,
make it all better.

00:14:51.933 --> 00:14:55.645
But the only one who can
make it better is you.

00:14:56.104 --> 00:14:58.523
We are our own knights
in shining armor.

00:14:58.689 --> 00:14:59.941
I love that episode.

00:15:00.024 --> 00:15:01.126
Yeah, it started off
a little shaky

00:15:01.150 --> 00:15:02.443
with the whole
obese twins thing,

00:15:02.527 --> 00:15:03.986
but then it really picked up.

00:15:14.956 --> 00:15:17.333
Mom, look, none of these
clothes are mine.

00:15:17.417 --> 00:15:18.584
I know.

00:15:18.668 --> 00:15:20.468
They belong to the places
you stole them from.

00:15:20.503 --> 00:15:23.005
No, they just forgot to take
the security tags off.

00:15:23.214 --> 00:15:24.799
I found the purse, Dewey.

00:15:25.174 --> 00:15:26.509
Diane's purse?

00:15:26.592 --> 00:15:27.760
Sit down.

00:15:36.185 --> 00:15:39.272
I tried punishing you like
I did when you were little,

00:15:39.355 --> 00:15:41.023
but you're not a kid anymore.

00:15:41.107 --> 00:15:44.152
You're becoming a man, so
I'm gonna talk to you like one.

00:15:44.610 --> 00:15:45.945
What's going on?

00:15:46.195 --> 00:15:48.197
I hate not having things.

00:15:48.364 --> 00:15:51.033
You have things. Nice things.

00:15:51.242 --> 00:15:53.453
Girls only look at you
if you have designer clothes

00:15:53.536 --> 00:15:55.536
or you drive a cool car
or you live in a big house.

00:15:55.746 --> 00:15:57.349
And if you don't,
you basically don't exist.

00:15:57.373 --> 00:15:58.833
You think I don't
want nice things?

00:15:59.375 --> 00:16:01.711
I don't want to be cleaning
other people's houses,

00:16:01.794 --> 00:16:02.879
taking the bus.

00:16:03.171 --> 00:16:04.297
I thought you loved the bus.

00:16:04.380 --> 00:16:06.883
The bus sucks.
I know the bus sucks.

00:16:07.425 --> 00:16:09.260
But your dad's not earning
the way he used to,

00:16:09.343 --> 00:16:12.054
so I'm doing what I need
to do for our family,

00:16:12.138 --> 00:16:13.473
while you'rejust being selfish.

00:16:13.556 --> 00:16:14.825
It's not like
I'm hurting anybody

00:16:14.849 --> 00:16:16.684
by taking some shirts
from department stores.

00:16:16.767 --> 00:16:18.603
First off,
you literally hurt someone.

00:16:18.686 --> 00:16:20.396
You punched a classmate.

00:16:20.688 --> 00:16:22.190
And you stole from my client.

00:16:22.273 --> 00:16:24.442
She has a thousand purses.
She would never miss it.

00:16:24.525 --> 00:16:26.152
You need to hang around
rich people more.

00:16:26.235 --> 00:16:27.904
They notice everything.

00:16:28.070 --> 00:16:29.673
And guess who's the first
person to get blamed

00:16:29.697 --> 00:16:30.990
if something goes missing.

00:16:31.491 --> 00:16:32.909
I could have lost my job,

00:16:32.992 --> 00:16:35.328
which pays for
this apartment you hate,

00:16:35.411 --> 00:16:36.731
the clothes
you're embarrassed of,

00:16:36.787 --> 00:16:38.039
and those waffles you love.

00:16:38.122 --> 00:16:39.790
Do you know how many
eggos you eat, Dewey?

00:16:39.874 --> 00:16:40.958
Not even eggos.

00:16:41.083 --> 00:16:42.483
You buy the generic
toaster waffles.

00:16:42.585 --> 00:16:45.796
Because you inhale so many,
we can only afford the generic.

00:16:50.218 --> 00:16:52.136
I'm not looking for a thank you.

00:16:52.345 --> 00:16:55.598
I do those things because
I love you and I'm your mom,

00:16:55.681 --> 00:16:57.475
but it's been hard,

00:16:57.642 --> 00:16:59.769
and I can't have
you making it harder.

00:17:00.978 --> 00:17:02.605
Okay.

00:17:02.730 --> 00:17:05.608
I'm sorry, mom. I'll be better.

00:17:07.818 --> 00:17:09.320
Take these trash bags
and fill them

00:17:09.403 --> 00:17:13.032
with the clothes you stole,
so you can donate them.

00:17:14.408 --> 00:17:16.288
Where are you going?
The clothes are right here.

00:17:16.953 --> 00:17:19.330
There might be more. (G roans)

00:17:19.664 --> 00:17:21.499
(Phone ringing)

00:17:22.750 --> 00:17:24.168
Hello. Rocky: Hey, babe.

00:17:24.252 --> 00:17:25.532
I heard you were looking for me.

00:17:25.586 --> 00:17:28.422
Everything okay? Well...

00:17:29.215 --> 00:17:30.758
Yeah, actually it is.

00:17:30.883 --> 00:17:33.883
I was calling to tell you that Dewey
got suspended from school for fighting.

00:17:33.928 --> 00:17:36.597
Did he win?
Uh, I mean, uh, he did?

00:17:36.764 --> 00:17:38.057
It's okay, I handled it.

00:17:38.140 --> 00:17:39.517
How's everything
going over there?

00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:42.186
Oh, it's great.
The convention was nuts.

00:17:42.353 --> 00:17:43.729
Abdullah the butcher says hi.

00:17:43.813 --> 00:17:45.398
Anyway, I'll be back
tomorrow morning.

00:17:45.481 --> 00:17:47.121
I just got a couple more
meetings tonight.

00:17:47.275 --> 00:17:48.585
Come on, rocky,
we're all going to the bar.

00:17:48.609 --> 00:17:49.694
Rocky: Oh, okay.

00:17:49.819 --> 00:17:50.963
Soundshke an important meeting.

00:17:50.987 --> 00:17:53.531
Babe, you know I've been
struggling to book matches.

00:17:53.614 --> 00:17:55.157
You know how it is,
I gotta schmooze.

00:17:55.491 --> 00:17:57.743
Wrestling deals are made
over a six-pack of beer

00:17:57.827 --> 00:17:59.203
and country music...

00:17:59.287 --> 00:18:00.746
H... hello?

00:18:02.373 --> 00:18:03.374
(Gasps)

00:18:03.457 --> 00:18:05.376
No follow-up questions, please.

00:18:06.544 --> 00:18:07.962
So, in my first effort
to do better,

00:18:08.045 --> 00:18:10.065
I'm gonna tell you I was
planning to sneak out tonight

00:18:10.089 --> 00:18:11.966
and meet some friends.
Appreciate the honesty.

00:18:12.049 --> 00:18:13.968
(Phone ringing)
Don't answer that.

00:18:14.343 --> 00:18:16.262
No follow-up questions, please.

00:18:16.345 --> 00:18:19.015
Okay, fair, but I was thinking,
(Phone continues ringing)

00:18:19.307 --> 00:18:22.435
What if me and you
order some food instead?

00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:24.562
No way, I don't believe
that's true.

00:18:24.645 --> 00:18:26.147
I'm telling you, it's true.

00:18:26.230 --> 00:18:27.815
She had never seen
a porta potty before?

00:18:28.065 --> 00:18:31.068
She had never seen a porta
potty before the flea market, yes.

00:18:31.235 --> 00:18:32.361
She almost started crying.

00:18:32.445 --> 00:18:34.113
She said she was
wearing her red boots.

00:18:34.488 --> 00:18:37.366
Still, she was super into
dad's match once it started.

00:18:37.450 --> 00:18:38.576
She really loved it.

00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:40.661
What's this girl's name, again?

00:18:40.745 --> 00:18:42.204
Fine-a...

00:18:42.288 --> 00:18:43.456
Good-grades Karen.

00:18:43.873 --> 00:18:45.499
Well, I like that nickname.

00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:49.940
I hope you're not upset about
missing dinner with your friends.

00:18:51.255 --> 00:18:53.007
They'll survive without me.

00:18:53.924 --> 00:18:55.426
I can't believe it.

00:18:55.843 --> 00:18:57.136
He stood me up.

00:18:57.219 --> 00:19:00.514
Karen, I'm sure Dwayne's dead
on the side of some highway, okay?

00:19:00.598 --> 00:19:02.200
That's what it would take
for him to not be here.

00:19:02.224 --> 00:19:04.560
I've never been stood
up before in my life.

00:19:04.644 --> 00:19:06.103
Bonnie, is this what
this feels like?

00:19:06.562 --> 00:19:08.689
It is, and it'll stay with you.

00:19:09.607 --> 00:19:12.652
(Chuckles) All righty, time
to settle the bill, right?

00:19:12.943 --> 00:19:14.654
Bonnie, obviously,
I got you covered

00:19:14.737 --> 00:19:17.198
since you're my date,
but Karen...

00:19:18.699 --> 00:19:19.867
I had a diet sprite.

00:19:19.950 --> 00:19:22.411
And three chicken wings
from the shared appetizer.

00:19:22.703 --> 00:19:23.704
I counted the bones.

00:19:23.788 --> 00:19:25.373
So, doing a little math here,

00:19:25.456 --> 00:19:27.958
that is $1.50 plus $3.99,

00:19:28.042 --> 00:19:29.585
plus tax and tip.

00:19:29.710 --> 00:19:30.711
(Ukulele playing)

00:19:31.170 --> 00:19:32.755
No, mom. (Laughs)

00:19:33.214 --> 00:19:35.675
Hey, come on,
we're having a fun night.

00:19:35.758 --> 00:19:37.593
You used to love singing
this song with me.

00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:38.886
Yeah, when I was a kid.

00:19:39.095 --> 00:19:41.305
You're never too old to sing.

00:19:42.306 --> 00:19:45.893
(S I n g I n g) Don't
go breaking my heart

00:19:45.976 --> 00:19:48.229
(singing) I couldn't if I tried

00:19:48.354 --> 00:19:49.355
(giggles)

00:19:50.439 --> 00:19:53.317
Oh honey if I get restless

00:19:53.401 --> 00:19:54.443
sing.

00:19:54.527 --> 00:19:57.196
Baby you're not that kind

00:20:00.449 --> 00:20:02.451
both: (Singing)
Don't go breaking my heart

00:20:02.535 --> 00:20:04.203
you sound good.

00:20:04.286 --> 00:20:06.914
You take the weight off of me

00:20:08.290 --> 00:20:09.792
(young Dwayne and ata laughing)

00:20:11.460 --> 00:20:13.337
Oh, hey, mom, I'm gonna
drop those clothes off

00:20:13.421 --> 00:20:14.541
at goodwill after breakfast.

00:20:14.588 --> 00:20:16.257
Thank you.
I'm off to jazzercise.

00:20:16.340 --> 00:20:18.050
Have fun. Oh, and by the way,

00:20:18.134 --> 00:20:21.554
we're out of sim's market
brand toaster quilted pancakes.

00:20:21.637 --> 00:20:23.848
I'll stop by the store
on my way home.

00:20:24.432 --> 00:20:26.517
Yeah, I really put my mom
through it,

00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:28.102
but she never gave up on me,

00:20:28.185 --> 00:20:30.312
and she always showed me
what true strength really is.

00:20:30.396 --> 00:20:31.981
It's that mama bear mentality.

00:20:32.064 --> 00:20:34.024
Exactly, and that's why
I have such respect

00:20:34.108 --> 00:20:36.026
for strong women,
because I was raised by one.

00:20:36.569 --> 00:20:38.446
So is your mom
your running mate?

00:20:38.529 --> 00:20:40.614
(Laughs) No, although
she would love that.

00:20:40.698 --> 00:20:43.909
But the person I will choose
will share similar qualities.

00:20:43.993 --> 00:20:45.745
Well, I'm sure
I speak for america

00:20:45.828 --> 00:20:47.747
when I say we can't wait
to see who you choose.

00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:51.375
And also we have a little bit
of a surprise for you.

00:20:52.418 --> 00:20:54.962
Is this mic working? Hello?
(Both laughing)

00:20:55.045 --> 00:20:57.173
Mom, we're here.
Dewey, hi, Dewey.

00:20:57.339 --> 00:20:59.258
Oh, I love that
you still call him Dewey.

00:20:59.467 --> 00:21:01.969
Oh, even when he's president
I 'ii still call him Dewey.

00:21:02.052 --> 00:21:04.013
Mom. Yes, president Dewey?

00:21:04.096 --> 00:21:06.056
Mom, please.
Oh, president Dewey.

00:21:06.140 --> 00:21:07.933
Thathasaiflcesoundtoit
no, hdoesnt

00:21:08.017 --> 00:21:09.810
yeah, no, it doesn't.

00:21:09.894 --> 00:21:11.729
So, Mrs. Johnson,
do you think your son

00:21:11.812 --> 00:21:14.565
can become the next
president of the United States?

00:21:15.024 --> 00:21:16.066
Absolutely.

00:21:16.150 --> 00:21:18.360
When Dewey says
he's gonna do something,

00:21:18.444 --> 00:21:20.905
he will do it,
and you will smell...

00:21:20.988 --> 00:21:23.991
No, mom. Oh, mom. What
president Dewey is cooking.

00:21:24.074 --> 00:21:25.075
(Randall laughing)

00:21:25.367 --> 00:21:26.786
That's my mom. That's mom.

00:21:26.869 --> 00:21:29.121
(Laughs) Adult Dwayne:
Okay, that's enough. Bye bye.
