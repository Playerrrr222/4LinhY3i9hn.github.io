WEBVTT

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:29.988
Thing gave me your note.

00:00:30.655 --> 00:00:32.782
I was surprised you wanted to see me again

00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:34.826
after you ran out the other night.

00:00:35.994 --> 00:00:38.580
So, uh, is this a date?

00:00:38.663 --> 00:00:39.956
It's a surprise.

00:00:48.882 --> 00:00:52.302
When I came to Nevermore,
romance was the last thing on my mind.

00:00:54.637 --> 00:00:56.097
But when you kissed me,

00:00:57.098 --> 00:01:00.101
you opened my eyes
and suddenly it all made sense.

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:05.106
Xavier warned me about you,
but I didn't listen.

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:07.108
Ironic now, huh?

00:01:07.192 --> 00:01:09.235
Ironic would've been
framing Xavier for murder

00:01:09.319 --> 00:01:11.154
while the real Hyde
helped me put him away.

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.451
Wait… you don't think--

00:01:16.534 --> 00:01:18.244
I don't think. I know.

00:01:18.328 --> 00:01:21.372
Kinbott probably discovered your secret
during one of your sessions.

00:01:21.456 --> 00:01:22.499
So she unlocked you.

00:01:22.582 --> 00:01:23.792
Why'd you kill her?

00:01:24.459 --> 00:01:26.878
I thought Hydes
were typically loyal to their masters.

00:01:26.961 --> 00:01:28.379
Wednesday, this is nuts.

00:01:28.463 --> 00:01:31.966
On Outreach Day, I told you
I was visiting the old meeting house.

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:34.511
Did Kinbott send you to spy on me?

00:01:35.678 --> 00:01:36.513
At the Rave'N,

00:01:36.596 --> 00:01:39.140
<i>you overheard Eugene and me</i>
<i>discussing your cave in the woods</i>

00:01:39.224 --> 00:01:40.225
<i>and you warned Kinbott.</i>

00:01:41.142 --> 00:01:42.602
Eugene probably saw her torching it.

00:01:43.645 --> 00:01:46.231
Then she sent you to clean up her mess.

00:01:47.232 --> 00:01:49.150
I have to hand it to you, Tyler.

00:01:49.651 --> 00:01:51.986
Wounding yourself that night
at the Gates mansion,

00:01:52.821 --> 00:01:54.781
that was a masterstroke of misdirection.

00:01:54.864 --> 00:01:57.158
Okay, stop. Do you know
how insane you sound right now?

00:01:57.951 --> 00:01:59.202
I'm not a monster.

00:01:59.285 --> 00:02:00.995
A… And if you really thought that I was,

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:04.040
why would you risk bringing me
out to the woods to confront me alone?

00:02:04.124 --> 00:02:05.667
Who said I was alone?

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:18.096
Okay, I don't know what kind of sick joke
you're playing, but I'm out of here.

00:02:18.179 --> 00:02:19.013
Actually…

00:02:21.015 --> 00:02:22.559
you're coming with us.

00:02:44.664 --> 00:02:45.748
Welcome back.

00:02:47.208 --> 00:02:48.376
Where the hell am I?

00:02:48.877 --> 00:02:50.503
Somewhere no one can hear your screams.

00:02:50.587 --> 00:02:51.754
What's with the chains?

00:02:51.838 --> 00:02:53.381
Don't ask stupid questions.

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:56.926
Wednesday, this is crazy. I'm a normie.

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:58.428
That's only half true.

00:03:01.014 --> 00:03:02.140
Do you recognize her?

00:03:02.223 --> 00:03:05.393
Perhaps if I hadn't been so distracted
by my own mother hogging this photo,

00:03:05.476 --> 00:03:07.395
I would have noticed yours sooner.

00:03:08.688 --> 00:03:10.899
Your father fell in love
and married an outcast.

00:03:13.318 --> 00:03:15.820
My mom was an outcast.
That doesn't make me a monster.

00:03:15.904 --> 00:03:17.739
According to her
personal medical records--

00:03:17.822 --> 00:03:20.617
-You stole her medical records?
-Technically, Thing did.

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.912
He took them from your garage.
Your father's quite the pack rat.

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:27.582
Her postpartum depression
triggered her condition.

00:03:27.665 --> 00:03:29.542
My mom had severe bipolar disorder.

00:03:29.626 --> 00:03:31.002
We both know that's a lie.

00:03:31.085 --> 00:03:32.045
She was a Hyde.

00:03:32.837 --> 00:03:34.797
And your father has been
living his life in dread,

00:03:34.881 --> 00:03:37.675
never quite sure whether or not
she passed her condition on to you.

00:03:39.052 --> 00:03:41.804
Are you all gonna stand there
and let her do this to me?

00:03:41.888 --> 00:03:44.140
Uh, guys? Enid just texted.

00:03:44.224 --> 00:03:45.808
Thornhill's suspicious.

00:03:45.892 --> 00:03:48.561
How long until he morphs into that… thing?

00:03:48.645 --> 00:03:49.812
I'm not the monster.

00:03:49.896 --> 00:03:52.440
You are. I saw it
in a vision at the Weathervane.

00:03:53.107 --> 00:03:56.819
Wait, you're basing all this off
some vision you had after we kissed?

00:03:56.903 --> 00:03:58.738
I mean, is that something you can trust?

00:03:59.447 --> 00:04:00.949
Wednesday, what are you doing?

00:04:01.616 --> 00:04:04.535
Just some light torture.
Don't worry, I won't leave a mark.

00:04:04.619 --> 00:04:07.872
-Wednesday, hold on.
-Wait. Are you being serious?

00:04:08.539 --> 00:04:10.625
There's only one thing
that a Hyde understands.

00:04:11.376 --> 00:04:12.252
Pain.

00:04:12.335 --> 00:04:13.878
-Wait! No, Wednesday!
-Wednesday!

00:04:15.213 --> 00:04:16.381
That's it. I'm out!

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:19.050
-Us too.
-No.

00:04:19.133 --> 00:04:20.134
-Wait.
-No, I'm done.

00:04:21.261 --> 00:04:23.513
Wednesday, I didn't sign up for this.

00:04:23.596 --> 00:04:26.557
-Let's go to Weems, explain everything.
-Weems won't help.

00:04:26.641 --> 00:04:29.060
And Tyler is always
one step ahead of his father.

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:32.313
Then you're on your own.

00:04:34.399 --> 00:04:37.193
No, don't leave me here with her, please!
I'm begging you, please!

00:05:53.353 --> 00:05:57.190
<i>When I press him on his mother</i>
<i>or any sensitive issue, he snaps,</i>

00:05:57.273 --> 00:05:59.233
<i>becoming cold and detached.</i>

00:05:59.317 --> 00:06:01.486
<i>It's like I'm talking</i>
<i>to a different person.</i>

00:06:02.236 --> 00:06:03.946
<i>I'm increasingly concerned.</i>

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:06.115
<i>I believe the trauma of losing his mother</i>

00:06:06.199 --> 00:06:09.202
<i>may have left Tyler with deeper</i>
<i>psychological scars than I suspected.</i>

00:06:19.045 --> 00:06:21.130
-<i>Hello?</i>
-Sheriff Galpin.

00:06:22.131 --> 00:06:23.383
We have a problem.

00:06:24.759 --> 00:06:27.053
And her name is Wednesday Addams.

00:06:27.136 --> 00:06:30.306
What is Kinbott, or should I say
Laurel Gates, using you for?

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:31.849
Wednesday, please.

00:06:31.933 --> 00:06:34.936
Tyler, the body parts
in the basement of the Gates mansion,

00:06:35.019 --> 00:06:36.437
what was she collecting them for?

00:06:36.521 --> 00:06:38.564
I don't understand.
Why are you doing this?

00:06:45.905 --> 00:06:47.281
Let's test your reflexes.

00:06:47.365 --> 00:06:49.700
-I'm in here!
-Get away from my son! Drop it.

00:06:51.035 --> 00:06:51.953
Drop it.

00:06:58.251 --> 00:06:59.252
Sign here.

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:09.929
Sheriff Galpin isn't
pressing kidnapping charges.

00:07:10.012 --> 00:07:12.390
Which is a miracle
given the circumstances.

00:07:12.473 --> 00:07:13.349
Of course not.

00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:15.560
How long have you known?

00:07:16.394 --> 00:07:17.353
Excuse me?

00:07:17.437 --> 00:07:20.606
When I gave you that claw from the cave,
did you already know?

00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:22.358
Wednesday, that's enough.

00:07:22.442 --> 00:07:24.569
Xavier Thorpe is our Hyde.

00:07:24.652 --> 00:07:27.405
We've got evidence, thanks to you.
That's why I'm giving you one pass.

00:07:27.488 --> 00:07:29.282
Tyler is going to turn on you too.

00:07:29.365 --> 00:07:30.450
Let's go.

00:07:38.374 --> 00:07:39.208
Get out.

00:07:40.751 --> 00:07:41.919
We… Wednesday, wait.

00:07:43.629 --> 00:07:45.965
Tyler! No, no, what are you doing?

00:07:46.549 --> 00:07:48.134
I need to talk to her, Dad.

00:07:49.135 --> 00:07:50.470
She was my friend.

00:07:51.053 --> 00:07:53.139
We're in a police station.
What's gonna happen?

00:07:59.979 --> 00:08:00.813
Make it quick.

00:08:08.279 --> 00:08:09.155
What do you want?

00:08:10.781 --> 00:08:12.033
To ask a question.

00:08:15.578 --> 00:08:16.996
What does it feel like?

00:08:17.997 --> 00:08:19.582
What does what feel like?

00:08:20.833 --> 00:08:22.251
To lose.

00:08:26.923 --> 00:08:28.299
You know, at first,

00:08:28.382 --> 00:08:29.800
I'd wake up naked,

00:08:30.343 --> 00:08:31.636
covered in blood,

00:08:32.512 --> 00:08:34.222
no idea what happened.

00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:37.099
But over time,

00:08:38.267 --> 00:08:39.685
I started to remember

00:08:40.603 --> 00:08:41.562
everything.

00:08:43.147 --> 00:08:45.274
The sound of their screams,

00:08:46.108 --> 00:08:48.152
the panic in their eyes,

00:08:49.195 --> 00:08:52.823
and a fear so primal I could taste it.

00:08:57.286 --> 00:08:59.288
And it was delicious.

00:09:03.876 --> 00:09:05.920
You have no idea what's coming.

00:09:37.952 --> 00:09:40.997
The quid pro quo
for Sheriff Galpin not pressing charges

00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:43.583
is your immediate expulsion
from Nevermore.

00:09:44.333 --> 00:09:46.294
The others had nothing to do with this.

00:09:46.877 --> 00:09:48.087
I acted alone.

00:09:48.963 --> 00:09:52.466
For someone who claims to have no friends,
you certainly protect them.

00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:54.552
They didn't have guts
to do what needed to be done.

00:09:54.635 --> 00:09:57.555
You mean kidnapping and torture?
I should hope not.

00:09:57.638 --> 00:10:00.850
You do realize that Tyler
brutally disemboweled six people,

00:10:00.933 --> 00:10:02.977
then harvested a variety
of their body parts.

00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:05.187
Perhaps if you'd come to me
with your suspicions

00:10:05.271 --> 00:10:07.106
rather than take matters
into your own hands,

00:10:07.189 --> 00:10:08.566
we could've worked together.

00:10:08.649 --> 00:10:12.194
Because trust and cooperation have always
been hallmarks of our relationship.

00:10:15.865 --> 00:10:18.451
I admire your ability
to be your own person

00:10:18.534 --> 00:10:20.328
and trust your own instincts.

00:10:20.411 --> 00:10:23.539
But that also makes you
impatient and impulsive.

00:10:23.623 --> 00:10:26.792
Your actions have put me
and the school in an impossible position.

00:10:26.876 --> 00:10:28.294
Tyler is the Hyde.

00:10:29.128 --> 00:10:32.465
And he has framed Xavier.
He confessed everything to me!

00:10:32.548 --> 00:10:34.800
I wish I could believe you.

00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:39.805
His mother was an outcast.

00:10:39.889 --> 00:10:42.308
She was a student here,
you must remember her.

00:10:42.391 --> 00:10:43.643
She was a Hyde!

00:10:43.726 --> 00:10:45.519
Yes, Francois. A lovely woman.

00:10:45.603 --> 00:10:47.438
I didn't ask what she identified as.

00:10:47.521 --> 00:10:50.441
Then give me more time,
and I can prove they are Hydes.

00:10:50.524 --> 00:10:51.776
There is no more time,

00:10:51.859 --> 00:10:53.986
and there are no more deals, Wednesday.

00:10:55.196 --> 00:10:56.697
Pack your steamer trunks.

00:10:56.781 --> 00:10:58.199
We will have them shipped.

00:10:58.282 --> 00:10:59.742
And say your goodbyes.

00:11:00.826 --> 00:11:03.037
You'll be on the afternoon train tomorrow.

00:11:04.705 --> 00:11:07.875
I'm sorry Nevermore
didn't work out for you, Wednesday.

00:11:09.126 --> 00:11:11.545
I'm sure your mother
will be very disappointed.

00:11:16.050 --> 00:11:17.176
And so am I.

00:11:25.559 --> 00:11:28.479
Xavier… I'm not sure
how much time we have.

00:11:28.562 --> 00:11:31.107
Thing distracted the guards
and is looping the cameras.

00:11:32.358 --> 00:11:33.484
What are you doing here?

00:11:34.485 --> 00:11:35.986
I know you're not the Hyde.

00:11:36.570 --> 00:11:39.657
Tyler used me to frame you.
He is the actual Hyde.

00:11:42.410 --> 00:11:43.411
How do you know?

00:11:45.121 --> 00:11:47.164
I saw it in a vision when he kissed me.

00:11:49.792 --> 00:11:53.421
I'm… glad you were getting some action
while I was falsely accused.

00:11:54.088 --> 00:11:55.131
I should've believed you.

00:11:55.214 --> 00:11:57.883
But since you seem to have
some psychic connection to the Hyde,

00:11:57.967 --> 00:11:59.844
I was curious if you've drawn anything

00:11:59.927 --> 00:12:02.221
-that might shed light on this?
-You want my help?

00:12:07.476 --> 00:12:09.103
You ruined my life!

00:12:13.899 --> 00:12:14.775
No.

00:12:15.526 --> 00:12:16.902
I tried being your friend.

00:12:18.195 --> 00:12:20.614
-Look where that got me.
-This isn't about us, Xavier.

00:12:20.698 --> 00:12:21.699
No, it's about you!

00:12:22.283 --> 00:12:24.660
Every time you get involved,
people get hurt.

00:12:25.703 --> 00:12:26.871
You're toxic.

00:12:28.414 --> 00:12:30.708
All you ever do is make things worse.

00:12:37.214 --> 00:12:39.508
Tyler warned me something bad
was coming. I think--

00:12:39.592 --> 00:12:40.468
I don't care!

00:12:40.551 --> 00:12:43.012
Do you want to stop this? Then leave.

00:12:43.596 --> 00:12:45.431
Go far away and never come back.

00:12:47.516 --> 00:12:48.434
Do you understand?

00:12:49.685 --> 00:12:51.687
That can't happen if you're not here.

00:12:53.439 --> 00:12:55.524
That's how you save everyone, okay?

00:12:56.984 --> 00:12:57.818
So, go.

00:13:00.821 --> 00:13:01.989
Leave!

00:13:34.647 --> 00:13:38.776
I can't believe I'm actually going to miss
your creepy, lifeless eyes waking me up.

00:13:38.859 --> 00:13:40.528
It won't be the same without you.

00:13:43.239 --> 00:13:45.574
So I assume you'll be moving in with Yoko.

00:13:45.658 --> 00:13:47.243
Leaving me in the past.

00:13:47.326 --> 00:13:48.410
Not ever.

00:13:49.370 --> 00:13:50.329
What about you?

00:13:51.497 --> 00:13:52.665
Will you forget about me?

00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:57.545
Enid… the mark
you have left on me is indelible.

00:13:58.295 --> 00:14:00.506
Anytime I grow nauseous
at the sight of a rainbow

00:14:00.589 --> 00:14:02.842
or hear a pop song
that makes my ears bleed,

00:14:03.342 --> 00:14:04.677
I'll think of you.

00:14:07.221 --> 00:14:08.097
Thanks.

00:14:09.098 --> 00:14:10.182
I guess.

00:14:13.060 --> 00:14:15.855
I always believed relying on other people
to be a sign of weakness.

00:14:16.856 --> 00:14:20.109
That inevitably they would
lead me to disappointment.

00:14:22.862 --> 00:14:24.488
Turns out I've been the disappointment.

00:14:24.989 --> 00:14:26.282
Are you kidding me?

00:14:27.616 --> 00:14:29.493
I've learned so much from you.

00:14:29.577 --> 00:14:31.954
Part of it is admittedly
criminal behavior,

00:14:32.037 --> 00:14:35.958
but… most people spend their entire lives
pretending to give zero effs,

00:14:36.041 --> 00:14:38.419
and you literally
never had an eff to give.

00:14:40.504 --> 00:14:44.008
Any chance you've got
some sort of sneaky plan to elude Weems?

00:14:45.175 --> 00:14:46.260
Xavier's right.

00:14:47.428 --> 00:14:49.889
This prophecy cannot
come true if I'm not here.

00:14:51.390 --> 00:14:54.351
But it kills me to leave
when Tyler is still walking around free.

00:14:56.437 --> 00:14:57.980
If he tries anything,

00:14:58.063 --> 00:15:01.317
we have a school full of gorgons,
vampires, and werewolves,

00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:02.568
ready and waiting.

00:15:02.651 --> 00:15:04.820
We've got this, Wednesday. I promise.

00:15:07.489 --> 00:15:08.407
On a good note,

00:15:08.490 --> 00:15:10.159
I got a text from Eugene's moms.

00:15:10.242 --> 00:15:11.619
He woke up last night.

00:15:11.702 --> 00:15:13.954
Maybe Weems'll let you drop by
on your way to the station.

00:15:20.544 --> 00:15:21.879
I think we're all set.

00:15:23.172 --> 00:15:24.006
Thing,

00:15:24.590 --> 00:15:26.550
I'm going to miss our makeup tutorials.

00:15:26.634 --> 00:15:28.969
And you better keep sending me
moisturizing tips.

00:15:29.553 --> 00:15:30.888
Stay in touch, okay?

00:15:42.942 --> 00:15:43.943
So, we're gonna…

00:15:47.363 --> 00:15:48.322
You're right.

00:15:48.989 --> 00:15:50.658
Not hugging is kind of our thing.

00:16:02.419 --> 00:16:04.088
The plan wasn't to get you expelled.

00:16:04.797 --> 00:16:05.965
We're sorry.

00:16:06.548 --> 00:16:08.926
The Nightshades need to be ready
for what's coming.

00:16:09.426 --> 00:16:10.844
Or a lot of people are going to die.

00:16:13.931 --> 00:16:15.641
I'm so glad I caught you.

00:16:16.141 --> 00:16:19.645
I was weeding my wolfsbane,
and I just completely lost track of time.

00:16:20.562 --> 00:16:21.730
This is a parting gift.

00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:26.527
White oleander, one of nature's deadliest.

00:16:27.111 --> 00:16:29.738
It also symbolizes destiny and renewal.

00:16:30.489 --> 00:16:32.408
You're a very talented young woman,
Wednesday.

00:16:32.992 --> 00:16:34.952
I can't wait to see what you do next.

00:16:36.245 --> 00:16:37.204
Wednesday.

00:16:38.414 --> 00:16:40.666
This time I'm personally
escorting you to your train.

00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:43.085
I have one final favor.

00:16:58.308 --> 00:16:59.393
Wednesday!

00:17:00.269 --> 00:17:01.228
Eugene.

00:17:02.229 --> 00:17:04.189
Glad to see you're finally awake.

00:17:04.273 --> 00:17:06.734
-I heard you visited all the time.
-Don't ever mention it again.

00:17:06.817 --> 00:17:09.403
-Listen, I've been meaning to tell you…

00:17:11.321 --> 00:17:14.575
I shouldn't have gone to the dance.
I should have been with you.

00:17:14.658 --> 00:17:17.369
When the dance floor calls,
you gotta answer.

00:17:19.455 --> 00:17:22.958
-It's not your fault. It's the monster's.
-It's actually called a Hyde.

00:17:23.042 --> 00:17:25.753
It's still out there.
You can't go back to Nevermore.

00:17:25.836 --> 00:17:27.129
Not even to check on your bees.

00:17:28.130 --> 00:17:29.923
And you have to listen to me this time.

00:17:30.424 --> 00:17:32.468
I thought hummers were
supposed to stick together.

00:17:35.179 --> 00:17:37.222
That night in the woods,

00:17:37.973 --> 00:17:39.641
someone set fire to that cave.

00:17:39.725 --> 00:17:41.685
Yes, Dr. Kinbott.

00:17:41.769 --> 00:17:43.812
It's so crazy that it was her.

00:17:43.896 --> 00:17:46.315
I don't really remember any of it.

00:17:46.398 --> 00:17:49.693
I just saw someone wearing black
and those boots.

00:17:49.777 --> 00:17:51.195
What about her boots?

00:17:52.071 --> 00:17:54.281
There was an explosion of light

00:17:54.364 --> 00:17:56.492
and just for a moment,

00:17:56.575 --> 00:17:58.160
I saw that they weren't black.

00:17:59.036 --> 00:18:00.037
They were red.

00:18:20.057 --> 00:18:21.058
Wednesday.

00:18:22.142 --> 00:18:23.977
I thought you'd be
halfway to New Jersey by now.

00:18:24.061 --> 00:18:25.771
You can drop the act, Laurel.

00:18:26.355 --> 00:18:28.107
I should have known it was you.

00:18:28.190 --> 00:18:29.316
Faking your death,

00:18:29.399 --> 00:18:31.276
securing a job at Nevermore,

00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:32.820
unlocking a Hyde.

00:18:32.903 --> 00:18:35.614
Typically, I have great admiration
for well-executed revenge plots.

00:18:35.697 --> 00:18:39.118
But yours was a bit extreme,
even for my high standards.

00:18:39.868 --> 00:18:40.869
Oh, dear.

00:18:41.870 --> 00:18:43.122
Weems was right.

00:18:44.998 --> 00:18:47.000
You do need psychiatric help.

00:18:47.584 --> 00:18:51.255
Can't throw out wild accusations
without consequences.

00:18:51.755 --> 00:18:54.466
They may be wild… but they're true.

00:18:55.050 --> 00:18:56.593
Tyler told me everything.

00:19:03.976 --> 00:19:08.021
Initially I incorrectly accused Kinbott
of using hypnosis to unlock him.

00:19:08.105 --> 00:19:10.607
But you used
a plant-derived chemical, didn't you?

00:19:12.109 --> 00:19:14.778
I know your father kept tabs
on all the outcasts in town.

00:19:14.862 --> 00:19:18.365
So I assume he told you about the Galpin
family secret when you were just a girl.

00:19:18.448 --> 00:19:20.242
<i>That's why you targeted Tyler.</i>

00:19:20.826 --> 00:19:23.662
<i>You manipulated him</i>
<i>by showing him what his mother truly was.</i>

00:19:24.371 --> 00:19:26.665
What Tyler didn't realize
is that truth wouldn't free him.

00:19:27.541 --> 00:19:28.709
I'm so sorry.

00:19:30.502 --> 00:19:32.045
<i>It would enslave him to you.</i>

00:19:32.629 --> 00:19:35.424
That was scary at first,
so you used the cave and the shackles.

00:19:37.634 --> 00:19:40.304
<i>But eventually he willingly</i>
<i>became your servant.</i>

00:19:40.387 --> 00:19:42.681
And when Kinbott came close
to discovering the truth,

00:19:42.764 --> 00:19:44.933
you had Tyler kill her
and pin it on Xavier.

00:19:47.060 --> 00:19:48.562
Ugh. That's enough.

00:19:50.689 --> 00:19:53.317
Tyler, honey,
make Mama happy and shut her up.

00:19:54.067 --> 00:19:54.985
Permanently.

00:19:55.068 --> 00:19:56.486
He's not on your side.

00:19:56.570 --> 00:19:59.239
Tyler will do anything for me.

00:20:01.575 --> 00:20:03.285
Remember what I told you?

00:20:04.036 --> 00:20:05.996
I showed you who you really are.

00:20:08.248 --> 00:20:10.459
What they did to your mother…

00:20:12.211 --> 00:20:14.755
The outcasts made you a monster.

00:20:16.798 --> 00:20:19.927
If you only hate outcasts,
why is he killing normies as well?

00:20:21.511 --> 00:20:23.347
They're just pawns in a bigger game.

00:20:24.473 --> 00:20:26.016
Just like you, Wednesday.

00:20:26.099 --> 00:20:29.561
Once again,
you've underestimated the situation.

00:20:30.062 --> 00:20:31.939
You were never getting on that train.

00:20:32.022 --> 00:20:34.024
I sent Tyler to intercept you.

00:20:34.691 --> 00:20:36.568
I never made it to the station.

00:20:37.444 --> 00:20:38.445
Heard enough?

00:20:46.078 --> 00:20:47.955
Your slave is probably
still at the station.

00:20:48.956 --> 00:20:51.625
Don't make this more difficult
than it already is, Marilyn.

00:20:53.168 --> 00:20:54.586
My name is Laurel!

00:21:06.223 --> 00:21:09.184
Principal Weems!
Principal Weems!

00:21:21.863 --> 00:21:23.282
Nightshade poisoning.

00:21:23.365 --> 00:21:24.992
A fitting end, don't you think?

00:21:48.515 --> 00:21:49.516
Whoa.

00:21:50.934 --> 00:21:51.935
Are you okay?

00:21:52.477 --> 00:21:55.188
You're not gonna, like,
wolf out on me, are you?

00:21:55.272 --> 00:21:57.107
It is a full blood moon.

00:21:57.607 --> 00:21:59.401
I'm okay, I think.

00:22:01.570 --> 00:22:02.904
But this is helping.

00:22:15.667 --> 00:22:18.170
Hey! Eugene, how are you?

00:22:18.253 --> 00:22:19.421
<i>Have you seen Wednesday?</i>

00:22:20.005 --> 00:22:22.632
No, she left this afternoon.
Didn't she swing by to see you?

00:22:22.716 --> 00:22:25.761
Listen, Principal Weems and her
went and confronted Ms. Thornhill.

00:22:25.844 --> 00:22:27.804
But I haven't heard a peep
from either of them.

00:22:27.888 --> 00:22:29.598
Why would they confront Ms. Thornhill?

00:22:29.681 --> 00:22:31.850
<i>Because she's behind</i>
<i>everything that's happened.</i>

00:22:31.933 --> 00:22:33.894
<i>She's the bad guy… bad woman.</i>

00:22:33.977 --> 00:22:35.395
<i>She's just a really bad person.</i>

00:22:35.479 --> 00:22:38.190
Okay. Ajax and I will go
check out the conservatory.

00:22:38.774 --> 00:22:42.694
<i>-Yo. Bee boy, welcome back.</i>
What's he doing in your room?

00:22:42.778 --> 00:22:44.237
-Um…

00:22:45.864 --> 00:22:46.865
Wha…?

00:22:50.827 --> 00:22:52.579
Slow down! What happened?

00:22:56.750 --> 00:22:57.834
Principal Weems?

00:22:57.918 --> 00:23:00.212
-What the hell is going on?
-What about Wednesday?

00:23:00.921 --> 00:23:02.297
Tyler and Thornhill took her?

00:23:03.090 --> 00:23:04.257
Where?

00:23:05.008 --> 00:23:06.426
Crackstone's crypt, what the heck?

00:23:08.845 --> 00:23:10.222
Who are the Nightshades?

00:23:13.308 --> 00:23:14.935
I'll… I'll explain on the way.

00:23:16.061 --> 00:23:17.062
Come on.

00:23:17.687 --> 00:23:19.481
<i>Guys. Guys?</i>

00:23:20.565 --> 00:23:21.983
Calm down, Eugene.

00:23:22.067 --> 00:23:24.111
That gorgon is a moron.

00:23:24.778 --> 00:23:26.655
It… It could be dangerous.

00:23:26.738 --> 00:23:29.199
If Enid's right,
and Wednesday's been taken,

00:23:29.282 --> 00:23:31.701
-we need to call the sheriff.
-Mom, I've got to go.

00:23:31.785 --> 00:23:35.455
Wednesday's my only friend,
and if she's in trouble, I've got to help.

00:23:35.539 --> 00:23:36.623
It's hive code.

00:24:16.329 --> 00:24:19.207
Kind of a déjà vu thing
we got going on, huh?

00:24:20.083 --> 00:24:22.627
Except I won't cry and whine like a child.

00:24:22.711 --> 00:24:25.297
Tyler, go wait by the boat.

00:24:26.047 --> 00:24:26.923
Yes.

00:24:27.591 --> 00:24:30.010
Listen to your master
and be a good little Hyde.

00:24:37.434 --> 00:24:39.269
-I have to admit…

00:24:39.352 --> 00:24:42.272
…that shape-shifting stunt
with Weems almost worked.

00:24:43.773 --> 00:24:45.192
But as my father always said,

00:24:45.775 --> 00:24:48.945
"If you want to outsmart an outcast,
you got to out-think 'em."

00:24:50.947 --> 00:24:54.701
You know, we have roots that go
all the way back to Joseph Crackstone.

00:24:54.784 --> 00:24:57.037
So you come from a line
of psychotic killers too.

00:24:57.120 --> 00:25:00.123
Joseph Crackstone was a visionary,

00:25:00.207 --> 00:25:02.792
dedicated to protecting
normies from outcasts

00:25:02.876 --> 00:25:04.669
until his life was cut short

00:25:04.753 --> 00:25:07.380
by your ancestor, Goody Addams.

00:25:07.964 --> 00:25:10.008
And then, to add insult to injury,

00:25:10.091 --> 00:25:13.178
they stole his land to build
that abomination of a school.

00:25:19.142 --> 00:25:20.060
But,

00:25:21.478 --> 00:25:23.021
throughout the centuries,

00:25:23.104 --> 00:25:26.816
my family has remained
committed to Crackstone's mission.

00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:29.486
My brother died serving that cause.

00:25:30.278 --> 00:25:32.364
I decided to take a different approach.

00:25:32.864 --> 00:25:33.990
The supernatural.

00:25:34.991 --> 00:25:38.370
Tyler's been collecting these body parts
to resurrect Crackstone.

00:25:38.453 --> 00:25:42.624
The one man who nearly succeeded
in eradicating the outcasts.

00:25:43.833 --> 00:25:45.043
You can't wake the dead.

00:25:45.627 --> 00:25:46.670
Believe me, I've tried.

00:25:47.546 --> 00:25:51.341
I believe your ancestor Goody Addams
would disagree.

00:25:51.925 --> 00:25:53.176
Goody's Book of Shadows.

00:25:53.260 --> 00:25:55.929
You're the one that stole
the original from Pilgrim World.

00:25:56.805 --> 00:25:59.558
It wasn't enough for Goody
to kill Crackstone.

00:25:59.641 --> 00:26:01.726
She had to curse his soul too.

00:26:03.228 --> 00:26:04.938
What does this have to do with me?

00:26:06.106 --> 00:26:07.399
My dear Wednesday,

00:26:08.191 --> 00:26:09.776
you are the key.

00:26:09.859 --> 00:26:13.488
Your arrival at Nevermore set
the chubby wheels of my plan in motion.

00:26:13.989 --> 00:26:18.076
Goody sealed Crackstone
in his sarcophagus with a blood lock.

00:26:18.159 --> 00:26:21.079
Only one of her direct descendants
can open it.

00:26:21.913 --> 00:26:23.039
You are the key.

00:26:23.123 --> 00:26:26.293
A living descendant
on the night of a blood moon.

00:26:26.835 --> 00:26:30.130
So… I bided my time,

00:26:30.213 --> 00:26:32.215
and I made you feel special

00:26:32.716 --> 00:26:34.843
until you were ready to be sacrificed.

00:26:37.304 --> 00:26:39.514
Damn it.

00:26:39.598 --> 00:26:40.473
Quiet!

00:26:41.725 --> 00:26:43.059
Santiago, what's up?

00:26:43.143 --> 00:26:44.728
Sir, we got a situation.

00:26:44.811 --> 00:26:47.314
Eugene Ottinger's mom
just called, frantic.

00:26:47.397 --> 00:26:51.067
-Something's going on at Nevermore.
-Get a couple cars over there ASAP.

00:26:51.151 --> 00:26:52.819
<i>That's just it, I can't.</i>

00:26:52.902 --> 00:26:56.031
The tires on the squad cars
have been slashed. Every damn one.

00:26:56.823 --> 00:26:58.116
All right, I'm on my way.

00:29:02.323 --> 00:29:04.075
I am of your blood.

00:29:04.159 --> 00:29:09.247
I have summoned you to rid the world
of outcasts once and for all.

00:29:15.378 --> 00:29:18.673
My vengeance will be swift and true.

00:29:20.675 --> 00:29:21.509
As will mine.

00:29:23.970 --> 00:29:25.722
Goody Addams.

00:29:26.848 --> 00:29:28.600
You haunt me still.

00:29:28.683 --> 00:29:31.728
You will suffer the same fate
you bequeathed me.

00:29:33.897 --> 00:29:36.775
Now burn in the eternal fires of hell.

00:29:38.860 --> 00:29:40.987
Where you belong.

00:29:53.917 --> 00:29:55.960
Sweet dreams, Wednesday!

00:30:04.594 --> 00:30:07.931
I can't believe you're in a secret society
and you didn't tell me.

00:30:09.265 --> 00:30:11.017
Because, you know,

00:30:12.310 --> 00:30:13.394
it's secret.

00:30:15.772 --> 00:30:16.856
Bianca, Davina…

00:30:17.649 --> 00:30:18.983
and Kent?

00:30:19.067 --> 00:30:21.110
Seriously, even Kent is here?

00:30:21.194 --> 00:30:23.446
How exclusive is this club?

00:30:23.530 --> 00:30:25.907
So, what's the deal
with Thornhill being a psycho?

00:30:25.990 --> 00:30:29.035
She murdered Weems and then took
Wednesday to Crackstone's crypt.

00:30:29.702 --> 00:30:32.789
We have to get everyone in the school
to safety before it's too late.

00:30:32.872 --> 00:30:34.123
This is what's coming.

00:30:34.791 --> 00:30:36.376
So do we pull the fire alarms?

00:30:36.459 --> 00:30:39.087
We don't want to cause a panic
and alert Tyler or Thornhill.

00:30:39.963 --> 00:30:41.548
So how do we get everyone out?

00:30:42.799 --> 00:30:44.759
We'll use our siren song to convince them.

00:30:51.808 --> 00:30:53.810
Thing and I will go look for Wednesday.

00:30:54.727 --> 00:30:56.646
Okay, Nightshades forever.

00:30:59.190 --> 00:31:01.734
Seriously, a secret snap too?

00:31:10.785 --> 00:31:12.036
Wednesday.

00:31:15.540 --> 00:31:17.500
Are you here to take me to the other side?

00:31:17.584 --> 00:31:21.004
Listen, Crackstone must be stabbed
through his black heart.

00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:24.632
It is the only way
he will be vanquished now and forever.

00:31:25.216 --> 00:31:27.510
Is your spectral vision impaired?
I'm dying.

00:31:28.094 --> 00:31:29.429
Your necklace.

00:31:29.512 --> 00:31:30.847
It is a powerful talisman.

00:31:32.515 --> 00:31:35.018
My mother told me
it's for conjuring visions.

00:31:35.101 --> 00:31:37.395
It is also a conduit
for conjuring spirits.

00:31:37.478 --> 00:31:40.690
It will allow me
to pass through you and heal you.

00:31:40.773 --> 00:31:43.902
Just know, once I do,
you will never see me again.

00:31:44.694 --> 00:31:46.613
The school needs you, Wednesday.

00:32:39.791 --> 00:32:41.918
Why're we stopping
in the middle of the woods?

00:32:42.001 --> 00:32:44.796
-You tracking your little monster?
-You shut it.

00:32:48.967 --> 00:32:50.134
Hey, wait. Wait!

00:32:50.802 --> 00:32:52.387
Hey! What about me?

00:32:52.470 --> 00:32:53.471
What…

00:32:54.555 --> 00:32:56.099
Oh, you asshole!

00:32:57.141 --> 00:32:59.602
Come on, let's move quickly
and calmly, all right?

00:32:59.686 --> 00:33:02.063
-Good job! Let's keep moving.
-Bianca!

00:33:04.399 --> 00:33:05.566
What the hell's going on?

00:33:06.150 --> 00:33:08.820
Danger is on its way.
No time to delay.

00:33:14.283 --> 00:33:16.577
Follow me. Come on, faster.

00:33:32.593 --> 00:33:33.636
Oh my God.

00:33:34.137 --> 00:33:35.805
Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God!

00:33:36.305 --> 00:33:37.765
It's happening!

00:33:40.143 --> 00:33:41.519
Thing, I'm wolfing out!

00:33:55.616 --> 00:33:57.201
Laurel said you were dead.

00:33:57.744 --> 00:33:59.162
I'm feeling much better now.

00:33:59.746 --> 00:34:01.039
You're like a cockroach.

00:34:01.122 --> 00:34:03.291
Please, flattery will get you nowhere.

00:34:06.627 --> 00:34:08.504
This will not end well for you.

00:34:42.663 --> 00:34:43.539
Enid?

00:34:45.083 --> 00:34:45.917
Enid!

00:34:54.175 --> 00:34:55.927
I need to get back to the school.

00:35:02.100 --> 00:35:04.268
I can't tell you
how I've longed for this moment,

00:35:04.352 --> 00:35:05.770
what it means for my family.

00:35:05.853 --> 00:35:07.271
Silence, woman!

00:35:08.231 --> 00:35:13.069
Be gone, or I will cut thy tongue
from thy wretched mouth!

00:35:15.071 --> 00:35:16.197
Never meet your heroes.

00:35:27.875 --> 00:35:31.337
I will expunge
you abominations from this Earth!

00:35:51.107 --> 00:35:52.483
Yes!

00:35:52.567 --> 00:35:53.651
Yes!

00:35:53.734 --> 00:35:55.153
Yes, Thing!

00:36:23.848 --> 00:36:24.807
Tyler.

00:36:24.891 --> 00:36:26.434
Son, is that really you?

00:37:36.462 --> 00:37:37.838
Howdy, pilgrim.

00:37:41.217 --> 00:37:43.427
How canst thy heart still beat?

00:37:44.011 --> 00:37:46.722
What demon sorcery is this?

00:37:46.806 --> 00:37:48.057
Stay away from her!

00:38:01.070 --> 00:38:01.904
No!

00:38:04.782 --> 00:38:07.827
-Oh my God!
-I'm fine. Go. Get them out of here!

00:38:09.161 --> 00:38:10.538
Now!

00:38:10.621 --> 00:38:11.455
Okay!

00:38:15.668 --> 00:38:17.503
Come on, guys. Let's go! Go! Go!

00:38:59.378 --> 00:39:01.922
I will send you back to hell.

00:40:13.869 --> 00:40:15.830
You brought a gun to a sword fight.

00:40:16.831 --> 00:40:18.999
It's probably the first smart decision
you've made today.

00:40:19.667 --> 00:40:21.836
I might not get to kill all the outcasts,

00:40:21.919 --> 00:40:24.338
but at least I'll get to kill you,
Wednesday.

00:40:52.450 --> 00:40:55.119
Yeah, that's what you get
for messing with Nevermore.

00:40:55.619 --> 00:40:56.454
Bitch.

00:40:59.415 --> 00:41:01.625
Hummers stick together, right?

00:41:12.386 --> 00:41:13.888
I'll take it from here.

00:41:13.971 --> 00:41:15.639
Maybe we should call the sheriff?

00:41:15.723 --> 00:41:16.724
Turn around, Eugene.

00:41:38.370 --> 00:41:39.413
Enid?

00:42:17.535 --> 00:42:18.494
Where's Wednesday?

00:44:28.749 --> 00:44:29.833
I hate to admit,

00:44:30.334 --> 00:44:32.211
but I am gonna miss Principal Weems.

00:44:33.420 --> 00:44:34.630
She could be a real pain.

00:44:37.424 --> 00:44:38.550
But she was tough.

00:44:39.802 --> 00:44:42.971
And she died for the one thing
she truly loved, this school.

00:44:45.849 --> 00:44:47.601
For that, I have immense respect.

00:44:49.186 --> 00:44:50.646
She was one of us.

00:45:02.199 --> 00:45:04.034
Now that classes are canceled
for the semester,

00:45:04.118 --> 00:45:06.453
you have to come visit me
in San Francisco.

00:45:06.537 --> 00:45:09.289
I can pretty much guarantee
fog and drizzle every day.

00:45:09.373 --> 00:45:10.541
Sounds tempting.

00:45:11.041 --> 00:45:11.917
Bianca.

00:45:13.335 --> 00:45:14.837
I owe you a thank-you.

00:45:15.754 --> 00:45:17.715
We're getting that
fencing title next year.

00:45:17.798 --> 00:45:20.634
So don't let killing one
supernatural pilgrim get to your head.

00:45:58.422 --> 00:46:00.132
I hear you're a free man now.

00:46:01.383 --> 00:46:03.844
Yup. All charges dismissed.

00:46:05.471 --> 00:46:06.472
Listen.

00:46:06.555 --> 00:46:09.308
When I was in the cell
I said a lot of… things.

00:46:11.143 --> 00:46:12.728
Being your friend
should come with a warning label.

00:46:12.811 --> 00:46:17.191
But… I don't know a lot of people
who would take an arrow for me. So…

00:46:18.025 --> 00:46:20.152
Welcome to the 21st century, Addams.

00:46:27.242 --> 00:46:28.786
My number's in there already.

00:46:29.912 --> 00:46:31.163
That's a bold move.

00:46:32.372 --> 00:46:33.874
I hope you're not expecting me to call.

00:46:34.750 --> 00:46:36.001
No, never.

00:46:38.086 --> 00:46:39.254
I'd settle for a text, though.

00:46:42.674 --> 00:46:44.510
You know what a text is, right?

00:46:46.470 --> 00:46:48.055
Goodbye, Xavier.

00:46:51.517 --> 00:46:53.936
Hey, are you going to be back
next semester?

00:46:56.188 --> 00:46:57.606
Yes? No? Maybe?

00:47:31.723 --> 00:47:33.308
<i>My very first stalker.</i>

00:47:34.810 --> 00:47:38.355
<i>Maybe this forced vacation</i>
<i>will be more interesting than I imagined.</i>

00:47:40.190 --> 00:47:42.693
<i>Unlike my novel,</i>
<i>not every thread has been tied up,</i>

00:47:42.776 --> 00:47:44.653
<i>nor every question answered.</i>

00:47:44.736 --> 00:47:47.865
<i>Secrets are still lurking</i>
<i>in the dark corners of Jericho.</i>

00:47:53.412 --> 00:47:56.164
<i>Were Laurel Gates and Tyler</i>
<i>just pawns in a bigger game?</i>

00:47:57.499 --> 00:48:00.294
<i>Will today's stalker</i>
<i>become tomorrow's nemesis?</i>

00:48:05.090 --> 00:48:07.092
<i>I know the suspense is killing you.</i>
