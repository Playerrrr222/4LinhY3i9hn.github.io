00:00:11.011 --> 00:00:13.013
[intense music playing]

00:00:29.487 --> 00:00:30.989
[Corinthian] I'm not gonna hurt you.

00:00:31.072 --> 00:00:32.449
[Jed] You just killed that man.

00:00:33.491 --> 00:00:37.579
I just saved your life, again.
And I'm trying to save yours.

00:00:38.163 --> 00:00:39.080
From whom?

00:00:39.664 --> 00:00:40.790
[Corinthian] From Morpheus.

00:00:42.876 --> 00:00:44.335
[Jed] Who's Morpheus?

00:00:45.253 --> 00:00:47.630
Uh, Jeddy, can you give us a minute?

00:01:02.604 --> 00:01:03.438
[sighs]

00:01:05.023 --> 00:01:06.900
You're one of the missing Nightmares.

00:01:08.777 --> 00:01:10.528
And you are the vortex.

00:01:13.156 --> 00:01:16.326
If you know that,
then you know Morpheus is watching me.

00:01:16.951 --> 00:01:20.330
You think he's watching you
so he can protect you?

00:01:21.247 --> 00:01:24.375
He's watching you
because the minute you fall asleep

00:01:24.459 --> 00:01:27.837
and start bringing the walls down
between people's dreams,

00:01:29.172 --> 00:01:30.924
he's gonna kill you.

00:01:31.508 --> 00:01:35.011
But if someone protected you,
kept him from killing you,

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:39.599
well, then you'd become
the center of the Dreaming.

00:01:40.725 --> 00:01:44.771
He'd be powerless and I would be free.

00:01:45.438 --> 00:01:46.606
[knock at door]

00:01:54.489 --> 00:01:56.241
Ah. Good Doctor.

00:01:56.783 --> 00:01:59.619
Fifteen minutes till
our guest speaker's keynote address.

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:03.581
Uh, how did it go with Philip Sitz?

00:02:04.457 --> 00:02:05.500
It went well.

00:02:07.502 --> 00:02:08.419
You were missed.

00:02:09.838 --> 00:02:12.006
-Did you find the boy?
-I did.

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.675
We talked.

00:02:14.175 --> 00:02:17.137
He saw some grown-up things downstairs
that he didn't understand,

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:18.429
but I explained it to him.

00:02:19.222 --> 00:02:20.807
He won't be a problem?

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:22.267
Nothing I can't handle.

00:02:23.643 --> 00:02:25.728
I'll see you downstairs.

00:02:31.693 --> 00:02:33.194
[door opens]

00:02:35.446 --> 00:02:37.448
So, I'm gonna go downstairs for an hour.

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:41.452
Will you wait for me?

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:47.667
No. I'm taking Jed. We're going home.

00:02:49.169 --> 00:02:50.003
Okay.

00:02:51.462 --> 00:02:53.214
Yeah, you can go if you want,

00:02:53.715 --> 00:02:56.926
but obviously it's not safe for you
to be wandering around the hotel.

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:01.097
And if you leave the hotel,
Dream's Raven will find you.

00:03:04.017 --> 00:03:05.393
I'll tell you what.

00:03:07.103 --> 00:03:08.146
This is your room.

00:03:10.148 --> 00:03:11.274
You can have both keys.

00:03:12.692 --> 00:03:14.319
I'll come back in an hour.

00:03:14.402 --> 00:03:17.155
I'll knock.
If you want, you can let me in.

00:03:18.323 --> 00:03:19.866
But if not, I'll go away.

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:24.412
Lock the door when I leave,
because you never know.

00:03:30.126 --> 00:03:31.127
[door closes]

00:03:31.878 --> 00:03:36.424
Our guest of honor's presence
here tonight is proof,

00:03:37.508 --> 00:03:38.718
at least to me,

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:42.889
that dreams do come true.

00:03:42.972 --> 00:03:46.351
He is a legend in his own lifetime,

00:03:47.101 --> 00:03:48.770
an inspiration to us all,

00:03:49.938 --> 00:03:54.192
one of the first and one of the best.

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:58.863
Gentlemen. Ladies.

00:03:59.697 --> 00:04:00.823
The Corinthian.

00:04:00.907 --> 00:04:02.700
[audience cheering]

00:04:18.258 --> 00:04:20.134
I don't usually speak in public,

00:04:21.302 --> 00:04:24.555
but the opportunity
to talk to so many people

00:04:25.056 --> 00:04:28.768
who share the same passion,
the same dream,

00:04:29.769 --> 00:04:31.980
well, it was just too good to pass up.

00:04:33.648 --> 00:04:35.692
Because you are special people.

00:04:37.277 --> 00:04:39.570
Very special people.

00:04:40.905 --> 00:04:42.949
We are the American dreamers

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:47.161
driving down the holy road
of true knowledge

00:04:47.912 --> 00:04:51.624
that's paved with blood and gold.

00:04:52.834 --> 00:04:55.545
And across the length
and breadth of this fair country,

00:04:56.713 --> 00:04:58.756
we are killing people.

00:05:00.591 --> 00:05:02.885
We don't do it to make a living,

00:05:03.928 --> 00:05:05.847
we don't do it for revenge.

00:05:07.223 --> 00:05:09.976
We do not murder for profit.

00:05:11.728 --> 00:05:14.772
We kill to kill.

00:05:15.857 --> 00:05:18.985
We are entrepreneurs
in an expanding field.

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:24.949
But no one sees us
except for one weekend a year.

00:05:26.993 --> 00:05:28.119
Well, I see you.

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:31.622
I see you for who you truly are.

00:05:32.707 --> 00:05:34.375
And I want you to see it, too.

00:05:36.085 --> 00:05:39.964
So just do me a favor.

00:05:41.174 --> 00:05:42.759
Close your eyes.

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:49.349
And see yourselves as I do.

00:05:51.476 --> 00:05:54.312
We are gladiators.

00:05:54.395 --> 00:05:55.897
[squelching]

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:57.106
Conquerors.

00:05:57.648 --> 00:06:00.485
-[monitors beeping]
-We are explorers…

00:06:00.568 --> 00:06:04.322
-[gasping breaths]
-…truth seekers.

00:06:04.906 --> 00:06:06.407
We are swashbucklers.

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:08.868
We are hunters.

00:06:10.578 --> 00:06:12.080
Soldiers of fortune.

00:06:18.044 --> 00:06:20.463
And kings of the night.

00:06:25.301 --> 00:06:26.969
Jeddy, we have to go.

00:06:30.556 --> 00:06:32.475
You disappoint me, Corinthian.

00:06:35.853 --> 00:06:42.151
You and these humans
you've inspired and created…

00:06:43.694 --> 00:06:44.779
disappoint me.

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:48.491
I've done my best to be what you made me.

00:06:49.075 --> 00:06:52.286
No, you've done your worst,

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:55.373
which was in so many ways
what I had hoped.

00:06:56.124 --> 00:06:57.875
You were my masterpiece.

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:02.380
A dark mirror made to reflect
everything humanity will not confront.

00:07:03.673 --> 00:07:05.133
That's what I am.

00:07:06.801 --> 00:07:08.010
That's what I've done.

00:07:08.094 --> 00:07:12.515
No. Look at you,
walking this Earth for over a century

00:07:12.598 --> 00:07:16.310
infecting others with your joy of death,
but what have you given them?

00:07:16.978 --> 00:07:19.564
What have you wrought? Nothing.

00:07:21.357 --> 00:07:25.319
Just something else
for people to be afraid of. That is all.

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:28.448
So what now?

00:07:29.365 --> 00:07:31.492
You send me back into their dreams?

00:07:34.871 --> 00:07:36.622
'Cause I won't go willingly.

00:07:38.207 --> 00:07:42.378
And knife against a dream?

00:07:43.754 --> 00:07:45.882
You don't think dreams can die?

00:07:46.466 --> 00:07:48.092
-Let's find out.
-Enough.

00:07:51.179 --> 00:07:52.013
[Dream grunts]

00:07:52.096 --> 00:07:53.306
[Corinthian grunts]

00:07:54.056 --> 00:07:55.725
[breathing heavily]

00:08:03.983 --> 00:08:04.901
How?

00:08:06.277 --> 00:08:08.571
[Corinthian] I've got
Rose Walker getting stronger

00:08:08.654 --> 00:08:10.698
every second while you get weaker

00:08:14.702 --> 00:08:17.371
She's taking your place
at the center of the Dreaming.

00:08:20.416 --> 00:08:21.417
[Jed gasps]

00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:26.797
She's bringing the walls down
between the sleepers' minds

00:08:27.965 --> 00:08:31.302
and now they're all dreaming
the same dream.

00:08:31.385 --> 00:08:32.970
A dream that I inspired.

00:08:33.054 --> 00:08:35.264
-No.
-[Corinthian] It's already happening.

00:08:35.348 --> 00:08:39.393
There's nothing you can do.
She's asleep and dreaming.

00:08:39.477 --> 00:08:41.771
Then she's not beyond my reach.

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:44.023
Oh, I think she is.

00:08:45.608 --> 00:08:48.152
Now that she knows
you're planning to kill her.

00:08:53.282 --> 00:08:54.116
[Rose] Jed, run!

00:08:55.493 --> 00:08:57.411
You need to wake up.

00:08:57.495 --> 00:08:59.372
Don't listen to him, Rosebud.

00:08:59.455 --> 00:09:02.583
You're the one with power now,
not him. This is your dream.

00:09:02.667 --> 00:09:05.169
It's his dream, for your world.

00:09:05.253 --> 00:09:08.506
Then let's make it yours.
Whatever you want, Rose. A blank canvas.

00:09:10.883 --> 00:09:11.926
Where's Jed?

00:09:12.009 --> 00:09:13.052
Jed's fine.

00:09:13.135 --> 00:09:16.389
He's upstairs, asleep.
He's right next to you.

00:09:17.557 --> 00:09:20.434
This dream is yours now.
The Dreaming is yours now.

00:09:20.518 --> 00:09:23.396
The Dreaming is yours.
Is that what he told you?

00:09:23.479 --> 00:09:25.189
He told me you were gonna kill me.

00:09:25.273 --> 00:09:26.357
Did he tell you why?

00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:29.151
When a vortex brings down
the walls between dreams,

00:09:29.235 --> 00:09:31.195
she creates a single volatile dream

00:09:31.279 --> 00:09:34.115
that will collapse in upon itself,
and take the waking world with it.

00:09:34.198 --> 00:09:37.451
Your world.
Everything and everyone will die.

00:09:38.035 --> 00:09:40.204
-Don't believe him, Rosie.
-It's happened before.

00:09:40.288 --> 00:09:43.916
I failed in my duty,
an entire universe was lost.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.127
[Corinthian] He can't kill you
if you kill him first.

00:09:46.210 --> 00:09:47.461
Killing me may save your life,

00:09:47.545 --> 00:09:49.380
but it won't save the lives
of those you love.

00:09:49.463 --> 00:09:52.592
-I'm trying to keep you alive here.
-I'm trying to keep your world alive.

00:09:52.675 --> 00:09:54.885
-You have to choose one of us, Rose.
-[Rose] Enough!

00:09:59.098 --> 00:10:03.811
If I'm as powerful as you say I am,
then I will find my own way.

00:10:03.894 --> 00:10:06.647
In the meantime, the walls go back up.

00:10:11.235 --> 00:10:13.029
Because I'm not dreaming anymore.

00:10:14.530 --> 00:10:17.992
Thanks to you two, I'm wide awake.

00:10:18.075 --> 00:10:19.076
[gasps]

00:10:27.501 --> 00:10:30.463
If you think I'm going
back to the Dreaming with you--

00:10:30.546 --> 00:10:31.964
[Dream] You're not going back.

00:10:33.841 --> 00:10:37.553
I brought you into this world
to serve humanity. Not to feed upon it.

00:10:38.512 --> 00:10:40.598
Do you know why I do it?

00:10:42.558 --> 00:10:46.395
So I can taste what it's like to be human.

00:10:48.689 --> 00:10:51.025
And you don't care about humanity.

00:10:51.859 --> 00:10:56.322
You only care about yourself
and your realm and your rules.

00:10:56.405 --> 00:11:00.743
I contain the entire
collective unconscious.

00:11:00.826 --> 00:11:03.788
Without my rules, it would consume me.

00:11:05.748 --> 00:11:07.625
Humanity would be consumed.

00:11:07.708 --> 00:11:10.086
Or you might actually feel something.

00:11:12.254 --> 00:11:14.215
I am not the problem, Dream.

00:11:16.050 --> 00:11:16.967
You're right.

00:11:18.219 --> 00:11:20.012
This was my fault. Not yours.

00:11:21.722 --> 00:11:23.849
I had so much hope for you.

00:11:25.351 --> 00:11:26.894
But I created you poorly then.

00:11:30.815 --> 00:11:32.942
So I must uncreate you now.

00:11:41.325 --> 00:11:45.871
I am only sorry I won't be here
to see Rose Walker do the same to you.

00:12:06.517 --> 00:12:09.687
Next time I make you,
you will not be so flawed

00:12:09.770 --> 00:12:12.440
and petty, little Dream.

00:12:15.735 --> 00:12:16.569
And you…

00:12:18.738 --> 00:12:21.490
who call yourselves "collectors,"

00:12:22.658 --> 00:12:26.996
until now, you have sustained fantasies

00:12:27.079 --> 00:12:30.040
in which you are the victims,

00:12:30.624 --> 00:12:35.880
comforting daydreams
in which you are always right.

00:12:38.174 --> 00:12:39.425
But no more.

00:12:40.718 --> 00:12:42.511
The dream is over.

00:12:43.888 --> 00:12:50.561
I have taken it away.
For this is my judgment upon you,

00:12:52.396 --> 00:12:54.190
that you shall know

00:12:55.399 --> 00:12:57.443
from this moment on

00:12:58.986 --> 00:13:02.698
exactly how craven and selfish

00:13:03.616 --> 00:13:05.743
and monstrous you are.

00:13:07.036 --> 00:13:12.249
That you shall feel the pain
of those you have slaughtered.

00:13:12.875 --> 00:13:14.084
Hello, 9-1-1?

00:13:16.754 --> 00:13:18.798
I'm calling to confess to a crime.

00:13:18.881 --> 00:13:22.384
[Dream] And the grief of those
that mourn them still,

00:13:23.093 --> 00:13:29.934
and you shall carry
that pain and grief and guilt

00:13:30.768 --> 00:13:33.521
with you until the end of time.

00:13:33.604 --> 00:13:34.814
-[gunshot]
-[Jed gasps]

00:13:36.148 --> 00:13:37.191
[car starting]

00:13:47.409 --> 00:13:49.078
You want me to follow her?

00:13:49.161 --> 00:13:52.665
No. When she is awake,
she is not a threat.

00:13:52.748 --> 00:13:55.167
Tonight when she sleeps, I will find her.

00:13:57.294 --> 00:13:58.712
And we will end this.

00:14:04.718 --> 00:14:05.970
[Jed] Can I ask a question?

00:14:07.263 --> 00:14:10.182
Is Mom still sick, or…

00:14:11.851 --> 00:14:13.519
I'm sorry, Jeddy.

00:14:14.728 --> 00:14:15.604
She…

00:14:17.106 --> 00:14:19.108
She passed away a few months ago.

00:14:23.654 --> 00:14:28.158
You have to know though,
she never stopped trying to get you back.

00:14:30.119 --> 00:14:33.873
Dad just didn't wanna let you go.

00:14:36.375 --> 00:14:39.712
So, it's just you and me now?

00:14:41.964 --> 00:14:44.842
No. No, actually.

00:14:44.925 --> 00:14:49.263
We have a great-grandmother
who can't wait to meet you.

00:14:50.347 --> 00:14:52.850
And my best friend Lyta,
who lives upstairs.

00:14:52.933 --> 00:14:54.685
-[cell phone buzzing]
-She's calling you.

00:14:56.186 --> 00:14:59.023
Hey! Guess who's in the car with me?

00:14:59.106 --> 00:15:02.192
[Lyta] I don't want you to panic.
I'm at the hospital.

00:15:02.776 --> 00:15:03.611
What?

00:15:03.694 --> 00:15:05.988
The baby's coming. I'm in labor.

00:15:06.071 --> 00:15:07.239
Oh, my God!

00:15:07.323 --> 00:15:08.490
Is that Rose?

00:15:08.574 --> 00:15:11.368
And Barbie and Ken and Hal are here.

00:15:11.452 --> 00:15:13.287
We're taking good care of her, Rose.

00:15:13.370 --> 00:15:17.458
-[Lyta] Chantal and Zelda are on the way.
-So are we, I promise.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:19.752
[Lyta] Don't rush. Drive safely.

00:15:21.003 --> 00:15:22.129
See you soon.

00:15:27.468 --> 00:15:28.844
How is she? Is she okay?

00:15:28.928 --> 00:15:31.138
I am sure she's fine,
but we are not family

00:15:31.221 --> 00:15:32.765
so they're not telling us anything.

00:15:34.058 --> 00:15:36.352
So, did you know she was pregnant?

00:15:36.936 --> 00:15:38.354
[Chantal] Of course she knew.

00:15:39.438 --> 00:15:41.315
You did know, didn't you?

00:15:42.650 --> 00:15:44.401
Everyone, this is Jed.

00:15:44.485 --> 00:15:46.403
-[Barbie] Jed! Hi.
-Hey, Jed!

00:15:47.363 --> 00:15:48.906
Is that a real spider?

00:15:48.989 --> 00:15:50.074
[Chantal] It used to be.

00:15:50.157 --> 00:15:53.243
We have a vast collection
of arachnid taxidermy.

00:15:53.327 --> 00:15:54.536
If you'd like to see?

00:15:54.620 --> 00:15:55.913
Hey, Rose.

00:15:56.538 --> 00:16:00.167
Uh, so she's still only three centimeters.
The doctor's with her now.

00:16:00.250 --> 00:16:02.086
Oh, that, um, nurse told you that?

00:16:02.169 --> 00:16:03.879
Yeah. Yeah. She's really nice.

00:16:04.755 --> 00:16:06.465
[Barbie] Yeah, she looks really nice.

00:16:07.049 --> 00:16:08.759
Uh, where's Gilbert?

00:16:09.343 --> 00:16:14.056
He left a note saying he had to go home.
I thought he was with you guys.

00:16:14.139 --> 00:16:15.015
Uh, no.

00:16:15.099 --> 00:16:17.977
Well, is there anyone
we should call? Lyta's family?

00:16:18.060 --> 00:16:20.396
Or the baby's daddy, whoever it is.

00:16:20.479 --> 00:16:22.481
You don't have to tell us.
[whispers] Who is he?

00:16:23.273 --> 00:16:26.610
It's too late to call anyone right now.

00:16:26.694 --> 00:16:27.736
Although…

00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:29.196
Unity?

00:16:29.822 --> 00:16:31.532
[Unity over phone] Good morning, darling.

00:16:31.615 --> 00:16:33.409
I woke you up. I'm sorry.

00:16:33.492 --> 00:16:38.998
Oh, Rose, the one thing I do not
need more of in my life is sleep.

00:16:39.081 --> 00:16:40.582
Did you find Jed?

00:16:40.666 --> 00:16:42.876
I did. He's safe.

00:16:43.460 --> 00:16:46.296
But may I ask a favor?

00:16:46.380 --> 00:16:48.757
Of course, darling. Anything!

00:16:49.967 --> 00:16:56.348
If something were to
happen to me, hypothetically…

00:16:56.432 --> 00:16:58.559
Nothing's going to happen to you.

00:16:58.642 --> 00:16:59.685
If something did…

00:16:59.768 --> 00:17:02.187
If I went to sleep tonight
and didn't wake up,

00:17:02.771 --> 00:17:06.066
would Jed be able to come live with you?

00:17:07.818 --> 00:17:11.530
I was going to suggest that you
and Jed both come and live with me.

00:17:12.114 --> 00:17:12.990
You were?

00:17:13.073 --> 00:17:14.533
Oh, Rose.

00:17:14.616 --> 00:17:18.412
I often wonder what my life would have
been like had I not slept through it.

00:17:19.413 --> 00:17:23.375
Would I have had a family,
and what must that be like?

00:17:24.877 --> 00:17:29.089
Once you and Jed get here,
I won't have to wonder anymore.

00:17:30.424 --> 00:17:33.635
You really are amazing. Do you know that?

00:17:33.719 --> 00:17:35.929
It runs in the family.

00:17:39.475 --> 00:17:40.476
Get some sleep.

00:17:41.226 --> 00:17:44.646
I'm sorry I woke you. Sweet dreams.

00:17:45.147 --> 00:17:46.065
Goodbye, love.

00:17:52.738 --> 00:17:53.781
You okay?

00:17:54.990 --> 00:18:00.245
Zelda has a reassuring moral homily
concerning God and difficult times,

00:18:00.329 --> 00:18:03.207
and a variable number
of footprints in the sand.

00:18:03.916 --> 00:18:08.087
She told it to me once
and it cheered me up remarkably.

00:18:08.796 --> 00:18:09.797
Shall I ask if--

00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:12.257
Excuse me. Are you Rose?

00:18:13.759 --> 00:18:16.637
I'm sorry to put this on you right now.

00:18:17.137 --> 00:18:17.971
Don't be.

00:18:18.931 --> 00:18:25.270
I'm just afraid that tonight,
when I fall asleep…

00:18:27.481 --> 00:18:29.316
Dream's gonna kill me.

00:18:29.399 --> 00:18:30.526
He's not.

00:18:30.609 --> 00:18:35.197
He said if he doesn't kill me
that the whole world will die.

00:18:36.949 --> 00:18:37.991
Everyone.

00:18:38.534 --> 00:18:39.576
Listen to me.

00:18:40.828 --> 00:18:42.329
If this is true,

00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:45.290
if you have the power
to destroy the world,

00:18:45.874 --> 00:18:48.502
then you have the power to destroy him.

00:18:48.585 --> 00:18:50.754
I don't want to destroy him.

00:18:50.838 --> 00:18:52.506
I don't want any of this.

00:18:53.090 --> 00:18:55.384
I'm afraid to fall asleep.
I'm afraid to wake up.

00:18:55.467 --> 00:18:56.677
He should be afraid.

00:18:57.636 --> 00:19:02.349
When you go to sleep tonight,
you have to find him and end this.

00:19:03.225 --> 00:19:04.476
It's up to you, Rose.

00:19:05.394 --> 00:19:09.481
You're in charge now. You're the vortex.

00:19:18.282 --> 00:19:19.658
[Dream] There is a vortex,

00:19:20.534 --> 00:19:22.035
a true annulet,

00:19:23.078 --> 00:19:24.705
a mortal with a dreaming ability

00:19:24.788 --> 00:19:28.083
so powerful she can travel
through the dreams of others.

00:19:28.167 --> 00:19:29.918
Be careful not to lose yourself in them.

00:19:30.002 --> 00:19:30.961
Find your own path.

00:19:31.044 --> 00:19:34.131
[Corinthian] You think he's watching you
so he can protect you?

00:19:34.214 --> 00:19:37.467
The minute you fall asleep
and start bringing the walls down

00:19:37.551 --> 00:19:38.760
between people's dreams…

00:19:38.844 --> 00:19:41.096
[Lyta] You have the power to destroy him.

00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:42.306
He's gonna kill you.

00:19:42.389 --> 00:19:44.016
-[Lyta] You're the vortex.
-[Jed] Rose!

It was a dark and stormy night.

00:20:29.853 --> 00:20:33.523
And the skipper said to the mate,
"Mate, tell me a story."

And this is the story he told.

00:20:35.692 --> 00:20:37.527
It was a dark and stormy night.

00:20:37.611 --> 00:20:40.948
And the skipper said to the mate,
"Mate, tell me a story."

00:20:41.031 --> 00:20:43.909
And this is the story he told.
It was a dark and stormy night.

00:20:43.992 --> 00:20:45.327
And the skipper said to the mate,

00:20:45.410 --> 00:20:46.787
-"Mate, tell me a story."
-Chantal?

00:20:46.870 --> 00:20:49.122
-And this is the story he told.
-It's me. Rose.

00:20:49.206 --> 00:20:52.751
It was a dark and stormy night.
And the skipper said to the mate,

00:20:52.834 --> 00:20:54.836
-"Mate, tell me a story."
-Here, let me.

00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:56.380
And this is the story he told.

00:20:56.964 --> 00:20:59.591
[both] It was a dark and stormy night.

00:20:59.675 --> 00:21:01.843
And the skipper said to the mate,

00:21:01.927 --> 00:21:05.264
"Mate, tell me a story."
And this is the story he told.

00:21:05.347 --> 00:21:08.684
-It was a da--
-In September of the year 1811,

00:21:08.767 --> 00:21:12.688
a post chaise drew up
before the door of Aswarby Hall

00:21:12.771 --> 00:21:14.564
in the heart of Lincolnshire.

00:21:15.274 --> 00:21:18.402
The little boy, who jumped out
as soon as it had stopped,

00:21:18.485 --> 00:21:19.611
looked around him.

00:21:20.779 --> 00:21:24.908
Caution, Princess Barbara, [sniffs]
I scent strangeness in the air.

00:21:24.992 --> 00:21:27.411
What manner of they, Martin Tenbones?

00:21:27.494 --> 00:21:31.290
The Cuckoo? The Hieromancer?
Colonel Knowledge?

00:21:31.373 --> 00:21:32.749
None of those.

00:21:32.833 --> 00:21:35.794
Something is happening, my princess. Look.

00:21:38.922 --> 00:21:39.798
Ken?

00:21:39.881 --> 00:21:41.174
[Ken moans softly]

00:21:41.967 --> 00:21:44.094
What are you doing at
the Place of Lost Carnadine?

00:21:44.177 --> 00:21:45.345
Oh, shit.

00:21:47.639 --> 00:21:49.016
Oh, my God.

00:21:50.350 --> 00:21:52.602
Come, Martin Tenbones. We must away.

00:21:54.730 --> 00:21:55.856
What are you all doing here?

00:21:56.732 --> 00:22:00.902
Babe. Th-This is not what it looks like.
Uh, I mean…

00:22:00.986 --> 00:22:02.404
[Ken continues indistinctly]

00:22:06.533 --> 00:22:07.993
-[rumbling]
-Oh, dear.

00:22:09.870 --> 00:22:10.996
Oh, my God.

00:22:20.213 --> 00:22:21.173
What's happening?

00:22:23.342 --> 00:22:26.178
It's me. I'm sorry. But it's just a dream.

00:22:26.261 --> 00:22:28.638
You just have to wake up. Right now.

00:22:28.722 --> 00:22:30.599
-[Ken] Rose!
-Rose, please!

00:22:31.892 --> 00:22:33.226
[Barbie screams] Rose!

00:22:34.353 --> 00:22:37.147
Rose, why are you doing this?

00:22:37.230 --> 00:22:39.066
I can't stop it. You have to wake up.

00:22:39.149 --> 00:22:40.942
Please, I'm begging you.

00:22:41.026 --> 00:22:42.486
It was a dark and stormy night…

00:22:42.569 --> 00:22:44.529
A post chaise…

00:22:44.613 --> 00:22:46.656
[Chantal] "Tell me a story."

00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:48.200

-[Rose] Hal!
-[Hal] I found you!

00:22:55.957 --> 00:22:57.584
-Hal, hold on.
-[Hal] Don't let go!

Rose, I'll save you!

00:23:04.049 --> 00:23:05.717
No, Jed, stay back.

00:23:05.801 --> 00:23:07.719

-No!

Jed!

00:23:20.273 --> 00:23:22.526
You've caused a great deal of damage.

00:23:22.609 --> 00:23:25.529
Nothing that I cannot repair,
at least at this stage.

00:23:25.612 --> 00:23:27.823
What happened to Jed? To my friends?

00:23:27.906 --> 00:23:30.909
They're asleep in their bed,
but they're not safe. No one is.

00:23:32.285 --> 00:23:33.995
Not until the vortex is dead.

00:23:57.894 --> 00:23:58.937
[Lucienne] May I help you?

00:23:59.855 --> 00:24:02.941
Oh, yes, please. I-I'm looking for a book.

00:24:03.442 --> 00:24:06.987
We have every book ever written,
as well as those yet unwritten.

00:24:07.821 --> 00:24:09.865
I'm looking for the story of my life,

00:24:11.283 --> 00:24:12.993
had things turned out differently.

00:24:14.077 --> 00:24:17.414
I have detailed accounts
of sleepers' dreams.

00:24:17.497 --> 00:24:20.083
No. No, thank you. I've had
more than my fair share of dreams.

00:24:22.627 --> 00:24:25.213
I want to read about my unlived life.

00:24:26.173 --> 00:24:29.551
I'm not entirely sure
we have those volumes.

00:24:31.511 --> 00:24:33.430
If you have every book ever written,

00:24:33.513 --> 00:24:38.310
and every book that ever will be written,
it must be around here somewhere.

00:24:40.020 --> 00:24:41.146
Oh, there I am.

00:24:48.361 --> 00:24:50.822
Rose Walker is your great-granddaughter?

00:24:50.906 --> 00:24:51.740
Yes.

00:24:54.075 --> 00:24:55.577
How do you know Rose?

00:25:03.752 --> 00:25:06.087
Death is not always such a bad thing.

00:25:07.047 --> 00:25:08.673
You could stay here if you like.

00:25:09.299 --> 00:25:10.967
My raven was once a mortal.

00:25:12.552 --> 00:25:15.222
[Gilbert] Wait! Sir!

00:25:16.681 --> 00:25:19.142
Gilbert? What are you doing here?

00:25:20.185 --> 00:25:21.394
This is Fiddler's Green.

00:25:22.938 --> 00:25:25.065
You? You're a Dream?

00:25:25.148 --> 00:25:26.066
I am.

00:25:26.942 --> 00:25:31.363
I, I left my post here
to experience life as a human being.

00:25:31.446 --> 00:25:36.076
A life which I humbly offer
in exchange for yours.

00:25:37.827 --> 00:25:39.579
I'm afraid that's not possible.

00:25:39.663 --> 00:25:41.706
For the Dreaming
and the waking world to live,

00:25:41.790 --> 00:25:43.041
the vortex must die.

00:25:43.124 --> 00:25:45.544
Then what's the point of a vortex?

00:25:46.753 --> 00:25:48.338
Why do we even exist?

00:25:48.421 --> 00:25:49.548
Honestly…

00:25:50.257 --> 00:25:52.050
[Gilbert] I have a theory.

00:25:52.592 --> 00:25:56.638
When a human is at
the center of the Dreaming,

00:25:56.721 --> 00:26:01.560
is it not to remind us
that we exist because humans dream,

00:26:01.643 --> 00:26:03.395
not the other way around?

00:26:04.020 --> 00:26:09.359
The miracle of humanity itself
should always be more vivid to us

00:26:09.442 --> 00:26:11.945
than any marvels of power.

00:26:14.155 --> 00:26:18.285
I cannot find it in my heart
to punish you for leaving Fiddler's Green.

00:26:19.452 --> 00:26:22.247
But it is time you took up
your appointed position once more.

00:26:22.831 --> 00:26:23.999
It would be my honor, sir.

00:26:24.082 --> 00:26:27.252
It was never my intention
to abandon my role.

00:26:27.836 --> 00:26:30.714
What was your role? Who were you?

00:26:30.797 --> 00:26:34.968
Oh, my dear, Fiddler's Green
is not a "who," it is a where.

00:26:35.719 --> 00:26:38.763
I was not a person. I was a place.

00:26:39.472 --> 00:26:43.435
And, after your death,

00:26:44.269 --> 00:26:48.064
if you stay in the Dreaming, visit me.

00:26:48.690 --> 00:26:51.359
Walk in my meadows and my green glades.

00:26:51.901 --> 00:26:53.737
Rest beneath my trees.

00:26:56.448 --> 00:26:58.950
Farewell, Rose Walker.

00:26:59.034 --> 00:27:01.953
It was a privilege being human with you.

00:27:04.873 --> 00:27:06.875
[captivating instrumental music playing]

00:27:32.484 --> 00:27:34.277
I do not wish to take your life.

00:27:35.528 --> 00:27:38.365
But we all have responsibilities
and this is one of mine.

00:27:40.033 --> 00:27:42.035
[thunder rumbling]

00:27:48.958 --> 00:27:50.001
I am sorry.

00:27:50.543 --> 00:27:51.795
Just do it.

00:27:51.878 --> 00:27:54.631
Whatever it takes
to save my brother and my friends.

00:27:56.508 --> 00:27:57.717
I'm ready.

00:28:11.981 --> 00:28:13.650
My lord, stop.

00:28:15.568 --> 00:28:16.403
Unity?

00:28:16.986 --> 00:28:18.655
This is Unity Kincaid.

00:28:18.738 --> 00:28:20.407
I am Rose's great-grandmother.

00:28:21.324 --> 00:28:25.412
And according to this book,
I was meant to be the vortex of this age.

00:28:25.495 --> 00:28:28.790
But because you were imprisoned
and locked out of the Dreaming,

00:28:28.873 --> 00:28:30.875
that fate was handed down
to my descendants.

00:28:30.959 --> 00:28:32.252
I don't understand.

00:28:32.335 --> 00:28:34.254
[scoffs] You're not very bright, are you?

00:28:35.213 --> 00:28:36.256
Come here, Rose.

00:28:38.675 --> 00:28:40.468
I want you to reach down inside yourself

00:28:40.552 --> 00:28:43.179
and give me whatever it is
that makes you the vortex.

00:28:44.013 --> 00:28:45.598
But h-how?

00:28:46.182 --> 00:28:47.726
You're dreaming, darling.

00:28:48.476 --> 00:28:50.353
Anything is possible.

00:29:08.997 --> 00:29:10.123
[Rose] This?

00:29:12.375 --> 00:29:14.085
Oh, thank you, Rose, love.

00:29:19.090 --> 00:29:23.887
I'm the vortex now, Dream King,
as I should have been long ago.

00:29:23.970 --> 00:29:26.556
So, leave my great-granddaughter alone.

00:29:43.281 --> 00:29:44.324
Unity?

00:29:44.407 --> 00:29:45.658
[Unity groans softly]

00:29:45.742 --> 00:29:46.743
What happened?

00:29:47.744 --> 00:29:51.581
You died. So that Rose might live.

00:29:56.044 --> 00:29:57.504
I'm so sorry.

00:29:57.587 --> 00:30:00.173
[Unity] No, don't be. I'm not.

00:30:01.007 --> 00:30:03.468
I was meant to have died
a long time ago, Rose.

00:30:04.719 --> 00:30:06.137
But if I had,

00:30:07.931 --> 00:30:10.225
I would never have met my golden-eyed man

00:30:11.017 --> 00:30:13.937
and we would never have
had our beautiful baby girl,

00:30:14.020 --> 00:30:16.064
and you would not have been born.

00:30:16.147 --> 00:30:19.818
Wait, the father of your child
had golden eyes?

00:30:20.860 --> 00:30:22.320
I've never seen anything like them.

00:30:25.698 --> 00:30:26.741
I have.

00:30:29.285 --> 00:30:30.662
Goodbye, Rose, darling.

00:30:32.247 --> 00:30:36.417
Mr. Holdaway will see to it
that you and Jed have everything you need.

00:30:44.467 --> 00:30:46.594
You and your brother
are children of the Endless.

00:30:50.098 --> 00:30:51.391
You have suffered enough.

00:30:52.475 --> 00:30:53.977
You may leave this place.

00:30:54.519 --> 00:30:55.937
Goodbye, Rose.

00:31:10.285 --> 00:31:11.828
[cell phone chimes]

00:31:20.295 --> 00:31:23.590
He's really strong.
He won't let go of my finger.

00:31:24.883 --> 00:31:26.217
He's perfect.

00:31:27.093 --> 00:31:29.053
We're gonna do this together, right?

00:31:29.929 --> 00:31:33.182
We already are. Right, little man?

00:31:33.266 --> 00:31:36.811
I'm your Auntie Rose.
And this is your cousin, Jed.

00:31:36.895 --> 00:31:38.021
[Jed] Hello, little baby.

00:31:38.605 --> 00:31:40.064
Have you decided on a name?

00:31:41.065 --> 00:31:43.484
I thought about
naming him after Hector, but…

00:31:44.986 --> 00:31:46.529
there is only one Hector for me.

00:31:48.698 --> 00:31:51.826
And this baby deserves his own name.

00:31:53.077 --> 00:31:55.705
You ever notice how people
only ever use your name

00:31:55.788 --> 00:31:56.915
when you're in trouble?

00:31:57.957 --> 00:31:59.125
Rose?

00:31:59.709 --> 00:32:01.210
That's true, actually.

00:32:01.794 --> 00:32:06.090
See? So, as long as you don't have a name,
you can't get in any trouble.

00:32:17.101 --> 00:32:18.436
My turn. [chuckles]

00:32:18.519 --> 00:32:20.271
Prepare yourself. He's pretty cute.

00:32:20.355 --> 00:32:22.148
Oh, we are ready.

00:32:22.231 --> 00:32:24.150
It's one at a time.

00:32:24.233 --> 00:32:26.361
Wha… Oh, come on. Babe!

00:32:27.028 --> 00:32:28.821
Baby, it was just a dream.

00:32:32.992 --> 00:32:34.118
How are they doing?

00:32:34.202 --> 00:32:35.036
[Rose] Great.

00:32:35.119 --> 00:32:38.539
The hospital's releasing them tonight
and then we'll fly home tomorrow.

00:32:38.623 --> 00:32:39.749
Oh, so soon?

00:32:39.832 --> 00:32:41.125
To New Brunswick.

00:32:41.834 --> 00:32:43.294
How far is that from New York?

00:32:43.378 --> 00:32:46.756
Mm, less than an hour. Why?

00:32:46.839 --> 00:32:49.884
I don't know, I had this dream last night

00:32:49.968 --> 00:32:53.805
and now I'm thinking,
what if I sell the house and move back?

00:32:56.432 --> 00:32:57.684
We'll buy the house.

00:33:02.981 --> 00:33:04.983
[intense music playing]

00:33:22.500 --> 00:33:23.459
Desire.

00:33:24.585 --> 00:33:27.547
I stand in my gallery
and I hold your sigil.

00:33:28.172 --> 00:33:29.382
Talk to me.

00:33:30.049 --> 00:33:33.261
Why, sweet Dream. This is a surprise.

00:33:33.344 --> 00:33:35.221
-Almost an event, I might say.
-Good.

00:33:35.304 --> 00:33:36.222
I'm coming through.

00:33:37.181 --> 00:33:38.099
You are?

00:33:39.350 --> 00:33:40.476
But of course.

00:33:40.977 --> 00:33:44.063
You know you're always
welcome in my chambers.

00:33:50.111 --> 00:33:51.904
Lovely to see you.

00:33:53.740 --> 00:33:57.410
Can I get you anything you desire?

00:33:58.161 --> 00:34:00.997
I desire nothing from you,
save some answers.

00:34:01.080 --> 00:34:03.041
Ooh, is this a test?

00:34:03.541 --> 00:34:06.961
Unity Kincaid should've
been the vortex of this era.

00:34:08.254 --> 00:34:11.299
But someone took advantage
of my imprisonment

00:34:11.382 --> 00:34:14.135
and fathered a child with her,

00:34:14.218 --> 00:34:17.055
knowing full well
that it would become the vortex,

00:34:17.138 --> 00:34:18.806
and I would be forced to kill it.

00:34:19.515 --> 00:34:21.934
Was I really that obvious?

00:34:22.518 --> 00:34:23.352
No.

00:34:24.812 --> 00:34:27.398
You covered your tracks remarkably well.

00:34:27.982 --> 00:34:30.276
Well, that's high praise coming from you.

00:34:30.985 --> 00:34:32.403
What did you truly intend?

00:34:33.071 --> 00:34:34.739
That I should spill family blood?

00:34:35.740 --> 00:34:37.450
With all that would entail?

00:34:37.533 --> 00:34:38.993
[chuckles]

00:34:39.077 --> 00:34:41.496
This time it almost worked.

00:34:44.373 --> 00:34:45.666
My sibling.

00:34:47.668 --> 00:34:52.006
We of the Endless are the servants
of the living, not their masters.

00:34:53.424 --> 00:34:59.931
We exist only because they know
deep in their hearts that we exist.

00:35:01.432 --> 00:35:03.226
We do not manipulate them.

00:35:04.393 --> 00:35:06.562
If anything, they manipulate us.

00:35:06.646 --> 00:35:09.816
And you and Despair,

00:35:10.358 --> 00:35:13.778
and even poor Delirium
would do well to remember that.

00:35:13.861 --> 00:35:14.821
[Desire hisses]

00:35:15.530 --> 00:35:19.742
Mess with me or mine again
and I shall forget you are family.

00:35:21.244 --> 00:35:24.539
Do you believe yourself
strong enough to stand against me?

00:35:25.665 --> 00:35:26.749
Against Death?

00:35:27.917 --> 00:35:29.127
Against Destiny?

00:35:33.131 --> 00:35:34.048
No.

00:35:35.716 --> 00:35:39.846
Remember that next time you're
inspired to interfere in my affairs.

00:35:39.929 --> 00:35:41.681
Oh, poor Dream.

00:35:41.764 --> 00:35:44.392
I really got under your skin
this time, didn't I?

00:35:46.352 --> 00:35:50.356
Next time, I'll draw blood.

00:36:11.919 --> 00:36:12.879
[Lucienne] My lord.

00:36:14.297 --> 00:36:16.257
Sorry to disturb you
when you're working, but…

00:36:16.340 --> 00:36:17.341
Is something wrong?

00:36:18.050 --> 00:36:21.721
No, it's something lovely, actually.

00:36:22.638 --> 00:36:27.310
A new book appeared in the library
this morning written by Rose Walker.

00:36:28.060 --> 00:36:29.061
And how is it?

00:36:29.896 --> 00:36:33.941
You may take issue with the depiction
of the king in the story, but…

00:36:34.734 --> 00:36:35.693
I loved it.

00:36:35.776 --> 00:36:38.988
She is a daughter of the Endless
with quite a story to tell.

00:36:40.072 --> 00:36:42.283
-[Lyta] Rosie, send it.
-[baby gurgling]

00:36:43.034 --> 00:36:44.368
It's really good.

00:36:44.952 --> 00:36:47.455
Come eat. Dinner's here. Let's go.

00:36:50.708 --> 00:36:51.918
[speaking indistinctly]

00:37:00.134 --> 00:37:04.805
Are you making new Nightmares
to replace Gault and the Corinthian?

00:37:04.889 --> 00:37:08.351
The world does not need
a new Corinthian quite yet.

00:37:10.394 --> 00:37:11.229
In fact…

00:37:13.564 --> 00:37:16.943
will you keep this somewhere safe for me?

00:37:18.110 --> 00:37:20.571
I am finishing a Dream.

00:37:21.322 --> 00:37:22.573
I'll leave you to it, then.

00:37:25.993 --> 00:37:26.994
Lucienne.

00:37:29.830 --> 00:37:31.290
Do you not wish to say hello?

00:37:44.387 --> 00:37:46.639
You look gorgeous, Gault.

00:37:49.392 --> 00:37:51.060
Thank you, Lucienne.

00:37:53.312 --> 00:37:54.397
[exclaims softly]

00:37:55.439 --> 00:37:59.819
May I ask what made you
change your mind about me, sir?

00:38:00.611 --> 00:38:03.656
I had no right returning here
after over a century

00:38:03.739 --> 00:38:05.866
expecting everything
to be just as I left it.

00:38:05.950 --> 00:38:07.910
Lucienne tried to tell me that.

00:38:08.995 --> 00:38:09.912
So did you.

00:38:11.038 --> 00:38:12.665
But now I'm listening.

00:38:12.748 --> 00:38:15.584
Or trying to.

00:38:19.797 --> 00:38:20.840
New Dreams.

00:38:23.009 --> 00:38:24.302
New Nightmares.

00:38:26.887 --> 00:38:27.847
A new age.

00:38:32.268 --> 00:38:33.311
Thank you, sir.

00:38:53.122 --> 00:38:54.665
I might be here awhile.

00:38:56.334 --> 00:39:02.423
Would you mind
taking care of things while I work?

00:39:04.300 --> 00:39:06.344
With pleasure, sir.

00:39:06.427 --> 00:39:08.888
[enthralling instrumental music playing]

00:39:28.574 --> 00:39:30.576
[ominous music playing]

00:39:44.423 --> 00:39:45.466
Your Majesty.

00:39:50.888 --> 00:39:54.266
Shall I ring for your attendants
to help you dress?

00:39:55.893 --> 00:39:59.230
There are several demon battles
scheduled for your entertainment.

00:39:59.772 --> 00:40:02.233
I can think of nothing I'd enjoy less.

00:40:02.733 --> 00:40:06.070
In which case
Lord Azazel would like a word.

00:40:07.738 --> 00:40:09.073
Except that.

00:40:09.156 --> 00:40:11.742
[Azazel] Then I will
be brief, Your Majesty.

00:40:14.453 --> 00:40:19.458
Azazel, how like you
to arrive without an invitation.

00:40:19.542 --> 00:40:23.712
I come at the bidding of
the assembled Lords of Hell.

00:40:24.296 --> 00:40:27.925
You've stopped fighting each other
long enough to assemble?

00:40:28.008 --> 00:40:34.306
We have, against your enemy,
our enemy, Dream of the Endless.

00:40:34.390 --> 00:40:39.228
The armies of Hell are yours to command,
should you wish to strike.

00:40:40.020 --> 00:40:42.857
You wish to invade the Dreaming?

00:40:42.940 --> 00:40:44.775
If you command it.

00:40:45.359 --> 00:40:47.736
And then perhaps the waking world?

00:40:48.863 --> 00:40:53.742
And one day, even the Silver City.

00:40:53.826 --> 00:40:55.327
[Azazel] Precisely.

00:40:55.911 --> 00:40:58.456
Since none of us may leave Hell,

00:40:58.539 --> 00:41:04.086
we may as well expand its borders
until Hell is all there is.

00:41:05.671 --> 00:41:08.924
You have given us
much to think about, Azazel.

00:41:09.008 --> 00:41:11.635
[Azazel] I would ask
you do more than think.

00:41:11.719 --> 00:41:14.597
The generals demand action.

00:41:16.390 --> 00:41:17.349
Do they?

00:41:24.190 --> 00:41:28.194
Then I shall act. You may tell them.

00:41:28.986 --> 00:41:30.488
[Azazel] Excellent.

00:41:30.571 --> 00:41:33.324
Good day, Your Majesty.

00:41:37.286 --> 00:41:38.662
He is not to be trusted.

00:41:38.746 --> 00:41:41.665
No, but he's not wrong.

00:41:41.749 --> 00:41:46.420
Then, may I ask, what are you going to do?

00:41:52.301 --> 00:41:55.387
Something that I have never done before.

00:41:58.265 --> 00:42:03.729
Something that will
make God absolutely livid…

00:42:06.982 --> 00:42:09.902
and bring Morpheus to his knees.

00:42:11.403 --> 00:42:13.864
[demons chanting] Lucifer! Lucifer!

00:42:14.406 --> 00:42:16.825
Lucifer! Lucifer!

00:42:17.743 --> 00:42:19.995
[demons roaring]

00:42:20.079 --> 00:42:23.499
[raving] Lucifer! Lucifer!
Lucifer! Lucifer!

00:42:26.585 --> 00:42:28.587
