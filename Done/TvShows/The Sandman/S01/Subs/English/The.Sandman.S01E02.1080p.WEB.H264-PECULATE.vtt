00:00:13.221 --> 00:00:15.306
[captivating music playing]

00:00:42.459 --> 00:00:44.461
[footsteps crunching]

00:01:11.112 --> 00:01:12.822
I kept a journal for a while.

00:01:15.992 --> 00:01:18.787
A chronicle of everything
that happened in your absence.

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.000
But slowly, the words began to fade.

00:01:27.212 --> 00:01:29.214
Sometime after you left,

00:01:29.297 --> 00:01:33.718
all the books in the library
became bound volumes of blank paper.

00:01:34.886 --> 00:01:36.679
The next day, the whole library was gone.

00:01:38.807 --> 00:01:40.016
I never found it again.

00:01:41.059 --> 00:01:44.479
And yet you remained while others fled,

00:01:45.855 --> 00:01:48.525
the royal librarian
of an abandoned kingdom.

00:01:49.984 --> 00:01:51.402
I never felt abandoned.

00:01:53.029 --> 00:01:54.489
I knew you would return.

00:02:10.839 --> 00:02:11.840
[glass clinking]

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:26.980
[glass clinks]

00:02:31.192 --> 00:02:33.194
[enthralling music playing]

00:02:34.904 --> 00:02:36.823
[rumbling]

00:02:57.802 --> 00:02:59.554
[grunting]

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:05.435
You need rest, my Lord.

00:03:07.186 --> 00:03:10.189
And food and perhaps a bit more rest,

00:03:10.273 --> 00:03:12.358
and then you'll be back at full strength.

00:03:12.442 --> 00:03:13.610
[breathing heavily] No.

00:03:15.904 --> 00:03:17.280
Not without my tools.

00:03:17.363 --> 00:03:18.406
Your tools?

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:22.702
My sand, my helm, my ruby.

00:03:22.785 --> 00:03:24.287
Why? What happened to them?

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:25.580
They were taken from me.

00:03:27.165 --> 00:03:28.374
By my captors.

00:03:29.375 --> 00:03:30.710
And then taken from them.

00:03:31.544 --> 00:03:32.670
I know not where.

00:03:37.175 --> 00:03:38.968
Nor what I am without them.

00:03:43.723 --> 00:03:47.018
[woman, greets in Arabic]
Darling. How are you?

00:03:47.101 --> 00:03:48.686
[chuckles]

00:03:50.063 --> 00:03:54.442
Well, you'll never guess
what I am looking at.

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:56.819
It is a Caravaggio.

00:03:57.528 --> 00:04:01.574
And it can be
your Caravaggio for 22 million.

00:04:02.784 --> 00:04:06.246
Well, of course you can
think about it, but not for too long.

00:04:06.955 --> 00:04:10.250
[in Italian] Giovanni, it's Josiane.

00:04:10.792 --> 00:04:14.963
I hate to bother you at work,

00:04:15.755 --> 00:04:18.508
but I've just acquired
another of the Vasari volumes.

00:04:19.676 --> 00:04:22.053
Yes, very nice.

00:04:22.136 --> 00:04:25.556
[in French] Please tell the chairman
that Madame Daudet called.

00:04:27.642 --> 00:04:28.559
Yes, I'll hold.

00:04:33.523 --> 00:04:36.067
[in English] Bernard, I found it.

00:04:36.901 --> 00:04:40.488
And it's in exceptional condition.

00:04:41.656 --> 00:04:43.283
The Honjo Masamune.

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:46.577
[phone ringing]

00:04:50.873 --> 00:04:55.003
-Hello? Hello?
-[static noise]

00:04:56.796 --> 00:04:57.839
[phone clicks]

00:05:35.376 --> 00:05:37.628
[Corinthian] Quite the place
you got here, Ethel.

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:41.716
Who are you?

00:05:46.054 --> 00:05:47.055
How did you get in?

00:05:48.973 --> 00:05:52.894
Getting in was the easy part.
The hard part was finding you.

00:05:52.977 --> 00:05:54.771
You've done a very good job

00:05:54.854 --> 00:05:57.315
of convincing people
Ethel Cripps doesn't exist.

00:06:03.029 --> 00:06:04.405
Apparently not good enough.

00:06:04.489 --> 00:06:07.700
Well, I'm not exactly "people".

00:06:11.954 --> 00:06:13.164
What are you then?

00:06:13.748 --> 00:06:19.003
Do you remember the being Roderick Burgess
kept caged in his basement?

00:06:20.088 --> 00:06:21.214
Hmm?

00:06:21.297 --> 00:06:22.507
King of Dreams?

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:23.716
You're one of his?

00:06:26.094 --> 00:06:27.512
I'm my own man now.

00:06:28.721 --> 00:06:30.848
With your help, I intend to stay that way.

00:06:31.349 --> 00:06:32.683
Why do you need my help?

00:06:34.268 --> 00:06:37.188
Because he's out of his cage
and he's coming for us.

00:06:38.106 --> 00:06:39.065
You and me.

00:06:39.148 --> 00:06:42.568
Why me? I never did anything to him.

00:06:42.652 --> 00:06:44.362
Oh, you did though, Ethel.

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:47.115
You stole from him.

00:06:53.579 --> 00:06:57.291
[Dream] There is only one sure way
for me to find my tools.

00:06:59.293 --> 00:07:00.878
I must summon the Three-In-One.

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:03.923
[Lucienne] Surely it hasn't come to that.

00:07:04.006 --> 00:07:09.262
The Fates see past,
present and future, and they know all.

00:07:09.345 --> 00:07:12.431
Yes, but they speak in riddles.

00:07:13.141 --> 00:07:14.976
They never tell you what you want to know,

00:07:16.185 --> 00:07:18.020
only things you should never know.

00:07:19.897 --> 00:07:25.027
Perhaps just this once you could ask
one of your siblings for help.

00:07:26.362 --> 00:07:30.408
Destiny would certainly know
where your tools are, or Desire…

00:07:30.491 --> 00:07:34.036
My siblings have their own realms
to attend to, I have mine.

00:07:35.079 --> 00:07:37.457
We do not interfere
in each other's affairs.

00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:41.252
You may not,
but they've certainly been known to.

00:07:42.003 --> 00:07:46.215
Perhaps just this once
you could tell them what happened to you.

00:07:46.299 --> 00:07:50.428
I am quite sure
they know what happened to me.

00:07:53.681 --> 00:07:55.558
And not one of them came to my aid.

00:08:02.398 --> 00:08:04.192
The Fates aren't cheap, you know.

00:08:05.485 --> 00:08:07.403
They cost a bloody fortune.

00:08:09.906 --> 00:08:13.826
And at present, I cannot muster
power enough to summon them,

00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:15.870
let alone pay that cost.

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:18.331
Unless…

00:08:18.915 --> 00:08:21.918
Is there anything of mine
that remains in The Dreaming?

00:08:23.753 --> 00:08:26.047
Something that I created?

00:08:27.715 --> 00:08:29.050
You created all of this.

00:08:29.133 --> 00:08:32.970
No, something that remains intact.

00:08:34.514 --> 00:08:38.351
That might retain
some fragment of my power within it.

00:08:39.227 --> 00:08:40.603
Something I can absorb.

00:08:42.021 --> 00:08:43.105
There is one thing.

00:08:45.233 --> 00:08:47.235
[enchanting music playing]

00:08:51.697 --> 00:08:53.241
[creature screeching]

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:08.881
[man] Gregory,
come down from there right now.

00:09:09.632 --> 00:09:11.300
You're gonna slip and hurt yourself!

00:09:13.886 --> 00:09:15.012
That's it.

00:09:16.430 --> 00:09:17.557
There he is.

00:09:19.267 --> 00:09:22.103
[grunting]

00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:25.356
-Are you sure?
-[snorts]

00:09:25.439 --> 00:09:27.275
[chuckles]

00:09:27.942 --> 00:09:30.528
Good boy, Gregory. Good gargoyle.

00:09:31.237 --> 00:09:33.072
Cain, come quick.

00:09:33.864 --> 00:09:36.325
Blasted, bulbous, bilge-bubbling bollocks.

00:09:36.409 --> 00:09:38.327
-Cain.
-What you want, powder-brain?

00:09:38.411 --> 00:09:41.080
-Can you not see I'm busy?
-We have visitors.

00:09:42.373 --> 00:09:43.207
What?

00:09:45.084 --> 00:09:45.918
Where?

00:09:46.961 --> 00:09:47.795
[Dream] Cain.

00:09:48.546 --> 00:09:49.380
Abel.

00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:55.011
Lord Morpheus.

00:09:55.970 --> 00:09:56.804
You've come back.

00:09:56.887 --> 00:09:58.264
[Cain] At last.

00:09:58.347 --> 00:09:59.932
I told you he'd return.

00:10:00.016 --> 00:10:01.225
I never doubted it.

00:10:02.393 --> 00:10:03.477
Come in, my Lord.

00:10:03.978 --> 00:10:07.231
And you, Lucienne.
To the House of Mystery.

00:10:07.315 --> 00:10:09.859
Or to the House of Secrets. I have tea.

00:10:09.942 --> 00:10:11.152
I have tea and biscuits.

00:10:11.235 --> 00:10:14.322
Gentlemen, I'm afraid
this is not a social call.

00:10:14.905 --> 00:10:15.781
What's happened?

00:10:15.865 --> 00:10:17.575
-Is something wrong?
-What is it?

00:10:18.868 --> 00:10:20.411
For the sake of The Dreaming,

00:10:20.494 --> 00:10:23.164
I must take back a gift
I gave you long ago.

00:10:24.415 --> 00:10:25.499
Yes, my Lord.

00:10:25.583 --> 00:10:26.876
What's ours is yours.

00:10:26.959 --> 00:10:27.960
Anything at all.

00:10:28.961 --> 00:10:29.879
Just ask it.

00:10:38.638 --> 00:10:41.724
[grunting]

00:10:44.727 --> 00:10:46.604
[Abel] Surely there's another way.

00:10:46.687 --> 00:10:47.897
I wish there were.

00:10:49.690 --> 00:10:51.901
But The Dreaming must be restored.

00:10:51.984 --> 00:10:54.236
You say that as if
we're the ones that destroyed it.

00:10:55.029 --> 00:10:57.156
As if we disappeared for over a century.

00:10:57.239 --> 00:10:59.617
-Cain.
-You forget yourself, Cain.

00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:01.118
No, my Lord, you forgot us.

00:11:01.911 --> 00:11:04.372
Do you have any idea
what we've already lost

00:11:04.455 --> 00:11:06.666
waiting for you to come back
after all these years?

00:11:06.749 --> 00:11:07.917
What you have lost?

00:11:09.251 --> 00:11:10.378
The answer is no.

00:11:12.588 --> 00:11:14.340
I have not come here to ask you.

00:11:16.217 --> 00:11:17.551
I've come to ask Gregory.

00:11:19.095 --> 00:11:20.388
[rustling]

00:11:56.715 --> 00:11:57.800
[grunts]

00:11:59.468 --> 00:12:00.386
I need your help.

00:12:04.515 --> 00:12:06.767
Gregory, stop. No.

00:12:08.602 --> 00:12:10.771
Take me instead. Or Abel.

00:12:10.855 --> 00:12:13.274
-Yeah, take me, Lord Morpheus, please.
-I cannot.

00:12:13.941 --> 00:12:16.527
I can only reabsorb
that which I have created,

00:12:16.610 --> 00:12:18.487
and Gregory began as a Nightmare.

00:12:18.571 --> 00:12:20.906
[voice breaking] Yes,
but he's one of us now.

00:12:21.782 --> 00:12:22.825
It's not fair.

00:12:22.908 --> 00:12:26.328
No… it's not.

00:12:44.513 --> 00:12:46.348
[softly] You're a very good boy.

00:12:46.432 --> 00:12:47.808
[Gregory purring]

00:12:49.727 --> 00:12:50.728
[Abel sniffles]

00:13:12.708 --> 00:13:14.376
You don't have to do this, you know.

00:13:23.219 --> 00:13:24.470
It's not fair.

00:13:24.553 --> 00:13:25.846
[Gregory bleats]

00:13:39.276 --> 00:13:43.531
You have served
this kingdom with great honor.

00:13:46.575 --> 00:13:47.868
You will be missed.

00:13:50.621 --> 00:13:51.455
[sighs]

00:14:27.157 --> 00:14:29.159
[dramatic music playing]

00:14:43.507 --> 00:14:44.425
Come, Lucienne.

00:14:46.135 --> 00:14:47.344
We have work to do.

00:14:57.187 --> 00:14:58.397
Good luck, my Lord.

00:14:59.982 --> 00:15:02.484
Simpering suck-up.

00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:04.361
[grunts]

00:15:09.700 --> 00:15:14.204
I see you've turned your talent
for theft into a successful career.

00:15:15.497 --> 00:15:18.042
I don't steal them. I broker them.

00:15:20.461 --> 00:15:22.338
Well, you ever keep anything for yourself?

00:15:23.255 --> 00:15:24.089
No.

00:15:25.049 --> 00:15:26.884
Not even Dream's tools?

00:15:27.718 --> 00:15:29.303
Well, he's gonna want them.

00:15:29.887 --> 00:15:31.805
And I'm guessing that you do too.

00:15:31.889 --> 00:15:33.599
The tools, they won't work for me.

00:15:34.183 --> 00:15:36.018
They're made of the same stuff I am.

00:15:36.769 --> 00:15:39.772
So… why are you here?

00:15:41.065 --> 00:15:43.025
To see if we can help each other.

00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:46.028
I could show you how to use them.

00:15:46.111 --> 00:15:47.655
[chuckles]

00:15:47.738 --> 00:15:49.865
Use them to do what?

00:15:49.949 --> 00:15:52.785
Make him go away. For good this time.

00:15:54.328 --> 00:15:56.789
You want me to kill the King of Dreams?

00:15:57.790 --> 00:16:00.459
Right. You can do it. I know you can.

00:16:01.502 --> 00:16:04.129
You just have to listen and trust me.

00:16:04.213 --> 00:16:05.130
[scoffs]

00:16:05.214 --> 00:16:06.966
Then I'm afraid we're both dead,

00:16:07.675 --> 00:16:10.552
because I don't have them.

00:16:10.636 --> 00:16:12.262
Yeah, well, that is too bad.

00:16:12.846 --> 00:16:14.974
I wonder if your son knows where they are.

00:16:16.475 --> 00:16:18.102
How is John doing these days?

00:16:19.103 --> 00:16:23.315
What do you think Dream will do
to the son of Roderick Burgess?

00:16:25.317 --> 00:16:28.445
So I'll ask you one more time
for your son's sake.

00:16:30.364 --> 00:16:32.241
Where are the tools, Ethel?

00:16:43.252 --> 00:16:47.047
[Lucienne] Do you think you're
quite ready for this, Your Majesty?

00:16:47.881 --> 00:16:50.759
It has been some time
since you've navigated these waters.

00:16:52.261 --> 00:16:54.304
Do you think I've forgotten how?

00:16:55.055 --> 00:16:57.391
No, but… [sighs]

00:16:58.350 --> 00:17:03.313
I cannot ask The Fates for help
without giving them something in return.

00:17:04.356 --> 00:17:06.734
There is nothing left
to give from The Dreaming.

00:17:07.943 --> 00:17:11.363
I have to gather my offerings
from the dreams of others.

00:17:11.947 --> 00:17:12.948
I understand.

00:17:13.741 --> 00:17:16.201
It's just that, in your absence,

00:17:16.285 --> 00:17:20.873
these waters have become darker,
treacherous, unsafe.

00:17:20.956 --> 00:17:22.916
[pier creaking]

00:17:31.341 --> 00:17:34.511
These waters are as much
a part of me as I am of them.

00:17:36.597 --> 00:17:39.016
Gregory's sacrifice will not be in vain.

00:18:04.875 --> 00:18:06.251
You were right, Lucienne.

00:18:06.335 --> 00:18:09.880
The Dreams and Nightmares
no longer seem to recognize their master.

00:18:11.048 --> 00:18:15.260
I will remind them
and take from them what I require.

00:18:19.098 --> 00:18:21.934
Since one meets The Fates at a crossroads,

00:18:22.017 --> 00:18:25.020
I find one in the dreams
of a Cambodian farmer.

00:18:32.027 --> 00:18:35.948
The hanged man represents surrender
and sacrifice for the greater good.

00:18:36.657 --> 00:18:39.535
The gallows come from
a young Japanese cinephile,

00:18:39.618 --> 00:18:42.121
her head full of British horror films.

00:18:42.204 --> 00:18:43.247
[soldier] Release!

00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:48.544
[Dream] The currents are stronger
and faster than I remember.

00:18:49.628 --> 00:18:50.796
I have to focus.

00:18:52.506 --> 00:18:57.511
Open my eyes
and see what The Fates require.

00:19:00.764 --> 00:19:02.891
-A serpent…
-[hissing menacingly]

00:19:02.975 --> 00:19:04.434
…a symbol of transformation,

00:19:06.478 --> 00:19:10.274
of life, death and rebirth.

00:19:12.401 --> 00:19:14.194
I have gathered my offerings.

00:19:15.737 --> 00:19:17.364
Now, it is up to The Fates.

00:19:21.743 --> 00:19:25.622
I, Lord Morpheus,

00:19:25.706 --> 00:19:28.125
Dream of The Endless,

00:19:30.961 --> 00:19:32.087
summon The Fates…

00:19:32.171 --> 00:19:33.547
[thunder rumbling]

00:19:34.548 --> 00:19:36.383
…the Three-Who-Are-One,

00:19:37.759 --> 00:19:39.845
the One-Who-Is-Three.

00:19:40.971 --> 00:19:42.389
The Hecate.

00:19:42.472 --> 00:19:43.891
[thunderclap]

00:19:47.186 --> 00:19:50.397
Morpheus, it's been a while.

00:19:51.273 --> 00:19:55.569
You look thin, love.
Are you eating? Are you hungry?

00:19:55.652 --> 00:19:57.738
He is, but not for food.

00:19:57.821 --> 00:20:00.616
Look at him. He wants something.

00:20:00.699 --> 00:20:02.326
You've found me out.

00:20:02.409 --> 00:20:03.952
[thunder rumbling]

00:20:04.036 --> 00:20:05.621
I do want something.

00:20:07.206 --> 00:20:08.332
I need your help.

00:20:08.415 --> 00:20:09.416
Help?

00:20:10.250 --> 00:20:11.710
Oh, listen to him.

00:20:13.170 --> 00:20:15.297
Like you helped us against Circe?

00:20:15.380 --> 00:20:17.799
Circe is old business, sister-self.

00:20:17.883 --> 00:20:19.676
And he did bring nice stuff.

00:20:21.470 --> 00:20:23.263
[thunder rumbling]

00:20:29.937 --> 00:20:31.939
[dramatic music playing]

00:20:37.861 --> 00:20:40.614
You may ask us three questions.

00:20:53.001 --> 00:20:55.254
And get one answer from each of us.

00:20:55.337 --> 00:20:56.838
Thank you, ladies.

00:20:57.756 --> 00:20:59.049
My first question.

00:20:59.675 --> 00:21:02.302
I had a leather pouch filled with sand.

00:21:03.053 --> 00:21:04.096
Where is it?

00:21:07.933 --> 00:21:10.978
[The Maiden] It was sold in London.

00:21:12.729 --> 00:21:15.899
Last purchased by a magic user called…

00:21:18.735 --> 00:21:20.445
Johanna Constantine.

00:21:22.281 --> 00:21:23.699
Constantine…

00:21:24.616 --> 00:21:28.620
I knew a Constantine,
but that was 300 years ago.

00:21:30.038 --> 00:21:32.708
You said "last purchased."
Does she still have the sand?

00:21:32.791 --> 00:21:35.877
Dream, you know better than that.

00:21:36.461 --> 00:21:39.548
You get one question, one answer.

00:21:40.382 --> 00:21:41.383
My apologies.

00:21:42.301 --> 00:21:43.510
My second question.

00:21:43.593 --> 00:21:44.886
Go on, dear.

00:21:44.970 --> 00:21:48.515
My helm. What happened to it?

00:21:53.979 --> 00:21:55.981
[The Mother] It was traded away
to a demon,

00:21:58.525 --> 00:22:00.694
for the Amulet of Protection.

00:22:01.528 --> 00:22:03.238
To which demon was it traded?

00:22:03.864 --> 00:22:06.408
One question, one answer, love.

00:22:06.491 --> 00:22:07.784
Last question.

00:22:09.286 --> 00:22:13.081
My ruby, who holds it now?

00:22:13.165 --> 00:22:15.208
[baby babbling]

00:22:15.292 --> 00:22:18.879
Your gem was passed
from a mother to a son.

00:22:20.464 --> 00:22:21.590
Where are they now?

00:22:21.673 --> 00:22:25.093
[Three-In-One] You have
asked your questions!

00:22:25.177 --> 00:22:26.178
[thunderclap]

00:22:30.098 --> 00:22:32.100
[footsteps approaching]

00:22:37.647 --> 00:22:41.068
My Lord, you didn't give it to The Fates.

00:22:43.278 --> 00:22:45.113
Because it was not meant for them.

00:23:09.262 --> 00:23:10.263
[shudders]

00:23:18.146 --> 00:23:20.398
You don't listen, do you?

00:23:21.066 --> 00:23:24.611
Attractive men seldom do.
I suppose they don't have to.

00:23:25.821 --> 00:23:28.073
Ethel, are you flirting with me?

00:23:28.156 --> 00:23:31.868
You asked me where the tools are,
I told you I don't have them.

00:23:31.952 --> 00:23:36.164
I find that difficult to believe,
given your extraordinary success.

00:23:36.248 --> 00:23:39.000
Do you think that
the only way a woman can be successful

00:23:39.084 --> 00:23:40.460
is by using magic?

00:23:41.044 --> 00:23:43.463
Supernatural and sexist.

00:23:43.547 --> 00:23:45.757
You really are a Nightmare, aren't you?

00:23:45.841 --> 00:23:49.886
Oh, come on, you can't deny
the tools have helped you.

00:23:51.054 --> 00:23:54.808
They've certainly kept you
from looking your age.

00:23:55.517 --> 00:23:56.601
Now who's flirting?

00:24:03.066 --> 00:24:08.196
When I left Roderick, I traded the sand
and the helm for my life in America.

00:24:09.364 --> 00:24:10.782
And the ruby?

00:24:10.866 --> 00:24:11.867
The ruby…

00:24:13.243 --> 00:24:17.581
As you know, it does have the power
to make dreams come true,

00:24:17.664 --> 00:24:20.500
but it also makes nightmares come true.

00:24:22.169 --> 00:24:24.880
My son, John, took the ruby from me

00:24:26.006 --> 00:24:28.008
and then the ruby took John.

00:24:28.550 --> 00:24:31.511
Hmm. Well, where is it now?

00:24:33.054 --> 00:24:35.432
I don't know. Don't want to know.

00:24:35.515 --> 00:24:37.726
You're lying, Ethel.

00:24:39.895 --> 00:24:40.896
[sighs]

00:24:43.148 --> 00:24:44.524
You don't have to lie.

00:24:44.608 --> 00:24:45.775
In fact…

00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:49.196
[smacks lips]

00:24:49.279 --> 00:24:50.864
you don't have to say a word.

00:24:53.116 --> 00:24:59.206
Your eyes will tell me everything,
every thought, every feeling.

00:24:59.789 --> 00:25:03.835
You will regret this. I promise you.

00:25:03.919 --> 00:25:04.836
[scoffs]

00:25:05.337 --> 00:25:06.796
What makes you think that?

00:25:07.422 --> 00:25:09.716
I don't need Dream's tools.

00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:13.345
I have my own.

00:25:14.888 --> 00:25:16.681
[screams]

00:25:32.906 --> 00:25:33.823
Brother.

00:25:37.827 --> 00:25:40.538
Thanks for burying me
in such a shallow grave this time.

00:25:41.039 --> 00:25:43.583
And… for this.

00:25:47.545 --> 00:25:48.838
Who gave you an egg?

00:25:48.922 --> 00:25:49.923
You did.

00:25:50.507 --> 00:25:53.051
I didn't give you an egg.
Why would I give you an egg?

00:25:53.134 --> 00:25:54.761
As an apology for murdering me.

00:25:55.762 --> 00:25:58.390
When have I ever apologized
for murdering you?

00:25:58.473 --> 00:25:59.849
-[cracking]
-[gasps]

00:26:06.273 --> 00:26:07.732
[gasps] Cain, look!

00:26:10.568 --> 00:26:11.987
It's a baby gargoyle.

00:26:13.571 --> 00:26:17.075
If he thinks leaving this creature
on my doorstep makes up for Gregory…

00:26:17.742 --> 00:26:19.869
Do you think he came from Lord Morpheus?

00:26:19.953 --> 00:26:21.371
Who else, lackwit?

00:26:21.454 --> 00:26:23.790
He's trying to buy us off
with a baby gargoyle.

00:26:24.749 --> 00:26:29.129
Or he feels just as bad
about losing Gregory as we do.

00:26:29.963 --> 00:26:30.922
[Abel chuckles]

00:26:31.589 --> 00:26:32.424
[fusses]

00:26:33.049 --> 00:26:34.759
He's rather cute, isn't he?

00:26:36.344 --> 00:26:40.223
I think I'll call him… Irving.

00:26:41.433 --> 00:26:42.559
Irving?

00:26:43.351 --> 00:26:46.688
You can't name a gargoyle "Irving,"
you gully-guts.

00:26:46.771 --> 00:26:48.315
I like Irving.

00:26:48.398 --> 00:26:49.816
[Cain grunts in frustration]

00:26:53.570 --> 00:26:58.074
Gargoyle names… [blows]
always begin with a G.

00:27:00.327 --> 00:27:04.873
"Gormogon, Gladstone, Ganymede…"

00:27:05.540 --> 00:27:07.834
All right, then. Girving.

00:27:07.917 --> 00:27:09.252
[whimpers]

00:27:10.420 --> 00:27:12.464
-Girving?
-It starts with a G.

00:27:14.174 --> 00:27:17.802
It doesn't have to be Girving.
[splutters] It could be Goldie, Goldie's--

00:27:17.886 --> 00:27:18.887
[grunts]

00:27:20.138 --> 00:27:21.181
[body thuds]

00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:24.976
[whimpering]

00:27:32.692 --> 00:27:34.319
Miss Dee. Hi. I'm Jackie.

00:27:34.402 --> 00:27:37.405
I'll be escorting you inside today.
If you could just put this on for me?

00:27:37.489 --> 00:27:38.323
[Ethel] Thank you.

00:27:40.784 --> 00:27:42.369
-Hey, Sam.
-[Sam] Hey, Jackie.

00:27:42.952 --> 00:27:45.872
-I'll leave you in Sam's capable hands.
-Thank you, Jackie.

00:27:53.963 --> 00:27:55.131
Welcome back, Miss Dee.

00:27:56.091 --> 00:27:57.008
Thank you, Sam.

00:28:14.401 --> 00:28:15.568
Hello, Johnny.

00:28:20.490 --> 00:28:21.491
Hello, Mum.

00:28:25.203 --> 00:28:27.956
-How are you, Johnny? Are you well?
-[door closes]

00:28:29.874 --> 00:28:33.420
Same as ever.
Slightly bored. Highly medicated.

00:28:34.963 --> 00:28:37.382
The days are all the same in prison.

00:28:37.465 --> 00:28:40.009
Hospital, John, not prison.

00:28:40.093 --> 00:28:42.554
If it pleases you to think so.

00:28:43.221 --> 00:28:45.557
What did the doctors say?

00:28:45.640 --> 00:28:48.309
How's your therapy going?

00:28:49.394 --> 00:28:52.355
Is that your way of asking me
if I've forgiven you yet?

00:28:52.439 --> 00:28:53.982
[Ethel chuckles softly]

00:28:55.650 --> 00:28:57.694
You're fine, aren't you, darling?

00:28:58.820 --> 00:28:59.988
You've come a long way.

00:29:00.905 --> 00:29:02.240
I'm proud of you.

00:29:03.825 --> 00:29:06.119
Are you trying to convince me or yourself?

00:29:06.202 --> 00:29:08.830
I'm trying to have
a conversation with my son.

00:29:12.208 --> 00:29:13.501
We do need to talk.

00:29:13.585 --> 00:29:15.211
That rarely goes well for either of us.

00:29:15.295 --> 00:29:17.922
Perhaps I should ask the guard
to come in and referee.

00:29:22.051 --> 00:29:25.430
We need to talk about… the ruby.

00:29:30.852 --> 00:29:32.353
[wings flapping]

00:29:36.149 --> 00:29:38.318
[Abel grunting]

00:29:40.236 --> 00:29:42.155
[breathing heavily]

00:29:45.325 --> 00:29:46.576
[grunts]

00:29:47.619 --> 00:29:48.578
[chirps]

00:29:48.661 --> 00:29:51.456
Hello, Irving. I mean, Goldie.

00:29:51.539 --> 00:29:52.749
[chatters]

00:29:52.832 --> 00:29:54.709
I'll call you Goldie for Cain's sake,

00:29:55.335 --> 00:29:58.087
but I think of you as Irving, really.
In my heart.

00:29:58.171 --> 00:29:59.631
[whimpers]

00:29:59.714 --> 00:30:01.299
He can't help it. It's not his fault.

00:30:01.382 --> 00:30:04.344
It's who he is. It's who we are.

00:30:04.928 --> 00:30:06.971
The first murderer, the first victim.

00:30:07.055 --> 00:30:08.348
This is our story.

00:30:10.016 --> 00:30:11.684
Do you even know what a story is?

00:30:12.435 --> 00:30:13.561
Should I tell you one?

00:30:15.396 --> 00:30:16.606
It's a secret story.

00:30:18.817 --> 00:30:23.363
It's a story about two brothers
who loved each other very, very much.

00:30:23.988 --> 00:30:25.907
And they were very nice to each other.

00:30:25.990 --> 00:30:27.075
Nice and kind.

00:30:27.158 --> 00:30:28.868
And… and brotherly, you know?

00:30:30.537 --> 00:30:34.249
And the elder brother
never harmed the younger brother ever.

00:30:36.417 --> 00:30:40.129
And they didn't live in different houses.
They lived together in the same house.

00:30:45.718 --> 00:30:48.930
And they'd be… happy.

00:30:50.348 --> 00:30:51.808
[chirps]

00:30:51.891 --> 00:30:55.395
I don't mind getting murdered, honestly.
If that's what makes Cain happy, then…

00:30:55.979 --> 00:30:58.940
Hey, what are brothers for,
eh, little brother?

00:30:59.524 --> 00:31:00.441
[chatters]

00:31:00.525 --> 00:31:01.359
Come on, then.

00:31:02.151 --> 00:31:03.862
Shall we say good morning to Cain?

00:31:03.945 --> 00:31:05.196
-[whimpers]
-Oh.

00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:06.406
I'll be fine.

00:31:06.948 --> 00:31:09.075
He never normally murders me before lunch.

00:31:09.784 --> 00:31:11.661
He's not much of a morning person.

00:31:11.744 --> 00:31:13.955
Like me. Or you, apparently.

00:31:14.581 --> 00:31:16.833
[Lucienne] May I ask
where you're off to, sire?

00:31:16.916 --> 00:31:17.959
London.

00:31:18.042 --> 00:31:20.420
Did you not just spend
the last 100 years there?

00:31:21.754 --> 00:31:24.048
Sorry. Why London?

00:31:24.132 --> 00:31:26.009
The sand was sold there.

00:31:27.594 --> 00:31:31.055
When I have it back,
I will seek out my helm.

00:31:32.682 --> 00:31:33.641
In Hell.

00:31:34.976 --> 00:31:35.852
Oh, dear.

00:31:38.021 --> 00:31:41.190
Then will you grant me
one favor before you go?

00:31:41.983 --> 00:31:43.735
Take a raven with you.

00:31:45.570 --> 00:31:46.738
No more ravens.

00:31:47.363 --> 00:31:48.781
If not for you, then for me.

00:31:49.741 --> 00:31:52.410
A raven can go back and forth
between realms.

00:31:52.493 --> 00:31:54.746
-Keep me informed--
-I do not need a minder.

00:31:57.248 --> 00:31:58.917
I am Dream of The Endless.

00:31:59.500 --> 00:32:02.128
Yes, and Dream of The Endless
always has a raven.

00:32:03.212 --> 00:32:04.631
Jessamy was the last.

00:32:08.176 --> 00:32:10.929
If this Constantine
is anything like her ancestor,

00:32:11.012 --> 00:32:12.722
she will serve me well enough.

00:32:14.682 --> 00:32:16.309
She is only human.

00:32:20.605 --> 00:32:22.482
As was Roderick Burgess.

00:32:32.325 --> 00:32:34.077
What could possibly go wrong?

00:32:41.292 --> 00:32:43.628
[thunder rumbling]

00:33:00.812 --> 00:33:03.898
Oh, good. You've returned.

00:33:03.982 --> 00:33:06.985
And just in time too.
His Lordship will be pleased.

00:33:08.152 --> 00:33:09.320
Where is Dream?

00:33:09.404 --> 00:33:12.490
He's away. Again. For the moment.

00:33:12.573 --> 00:33:16.411
He's out there
looking for his tools, isn't he?

00:33:16.494 --> 00:33:17.745
He will be coming back.

00:33:18.997 --> 00:33:21.207
Well, then, I'd better get a move on.

00:33:21.290 --> 00:33:22.500
Where are you going?

00:33:22.583 --> 00:33:24.002
Back to the waking world.

00:33:25.003 --> 00:33:27.547
To freedom. You should try it sometime.

00:33:27.630 --> 00:33:30.675
Dreams and Nightmares
do not belong in the waking world.

00:33:30.758 --> 00:33:32.301
Oh, turns out I fit right in.

00:33:32.385 --> 00:33:34.095
Have you no loyalty to your creator?

00:33:34.178 --> 00:33:37.348
Why should I? He has no loyalty to us.

00:33:37.432 --> 00:33:39.100
You misunderstand him, Corinthian.

00:33:39.183 --> 00:33:41.102
Oh, no, I see him for what he is.

00:33:42.437 --> 00:33:46.065
He doesn't give a fuck about you or me.

00:33:46.733 --> 00:33:48.359
He only cares about himself.

00:33:48.943 --> 00:33:50.403
His kingdom.

00:33:51.654 --> 00:33:52.864
Well, he can have it.

00:33:54.282 --> 00:33:57.660
'Cause I am leaving
and I am never coming back.

00:33:57.744 --> 00:33:59.871
He will come after you.

00:33:59.954 --> 00:34:03.875
Well, then, if he does,
he won't be coming back either.

00:34:03.958 --> 00:34:05.835
[dramatic music playing]

00:34:08.046 --> 00:34:09.505
You can't change him.

00:34:11.340 --> 00:34:12.967
You can't save him either.
