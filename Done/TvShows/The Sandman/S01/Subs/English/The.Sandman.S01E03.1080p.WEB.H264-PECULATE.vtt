00:00:11.886 --> 00:00:13.888
[intense music playing]

00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:33.783
[engine stops]

00:01:08.526 --> 00:01:10.528
[voices whispering]

00:01:22.457 --> 00:01:23.458
Johanna!

00:01:25.043 --> 00:01:29.214
Astra. I came as soon as I got your text.
What is it? What's happened?

00:01:29.297 --> 00:01:31.174
We have to go.
We have to get out of here now!

00:01:31.257 --> 00:01:33.218
We will. Tell me what's happened.

00:01:33.802 --> 00:01:37.430
He said it was an accident,
like when Mum died.

00:01:41.226 --> 00:01:42.185
Where is he?

00:01:56.741 --> 00:01:57.742
Oi. Logue.

00:02:06.251 --> 00:02:07.085
[grunts]

00:02:08.711 --> 00:02:09.963
[Logue] Hello, Johanna.

00:02:10.046 --> 00:02:12.006
What the fuck did you do?

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.175
[grunts] We was just havin' a bit of fun.

00:02:15.009 --> 00:02:16.219
"Bit of fun"?

00:02:16.803 --> 00:02:18.763
Summoning demons for fun?

00:02:18.847 --> 00:02:22.058
-Who's "we"? Where are the others?
-Must still be inside.

00:02:22.142 --> 00:02:24.561
-Inside the club?
-You don't wanna go in there.

00:02:24.644 --> 00:02:26.688
No. No, I bloody don't.

00:02:27.647 --> 00:02:29.566
But someone has to clean up your shit.

00:02:32.986 --> 00:02:34.070
I'll come with ya.

00:02:36.322 --> 00:02:40.743
Believe it or not, love,
it's safer in here, with your father.

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:08.479
[doorknob rattling]

00:03:09.105 --> 00:03:11.107
[voices screaming]

00:03:12.317 --> 00:03:13.318
[Johanna screams]

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:18.990
[cab driver] All right, miss. We're here.

00:03:22.785 --> 00:03:24.787
Sorry, long day.

00:03:25.872 --> 00:03:27.540
Mine's just getting started.

00:03:28.166 --> 00:03:29.876
I have a feeling mine is as well.

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:34.631
[beeps]

00:03:43.514 --> 00:03:45.516
Johanna Constantine.

00:03:52.649 --> 00:03:54.817
Look at you, all done up.

00:03:54.901 --> 00:03:56.486
What are you doing here, Hettie?

00:03:57.111 --> 00:03:58.571
Same as you, I expect.

00:03:59.822 --> 00:04:00.949
He's coming, isn't he?

00:04:03.117 --> 00:04:05.787
-Who?
-Yeah, well, you know who.

00:04:06.913 --> 00:04:07.872
Morpheus.

00:04:08.498 --> 00:04:10.250
The Oneiromancer.

00:04:11.542 --> 00:04:14.212
You know, the Sandman, he's back.

00:04:15.088 --> 00:04:16.089
"The Sandman"?

00:04:17.048 --> 00:04:18.841
The one who puts the kids to sleep?

00:04:19.342 --> 00:04:20.843
He's a fairy story, Hettie.

00:04:20.927 --> 00:04:23.513
He's no fairy story, missy.

00:04:23.596 --> 00:04:25.640
He's back, and he wants his sand.

00:04:26.683 --> 00:04:30.144
Good to know. I'm off to work.

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:33.523
You'll see. I know.

00:04:34.691 --> 00:04:37.944
I'm 280 years old, and I know.

00:04:40.113 --> 00:04:41.072
Constantine.

00:04:48.246 --> 00:04:49.122
Have we met?

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:52.041
We have business, you and I.

00:04:54.335 --> 00:04:55.378
Get in line, bruv.

00:04:56.796 --> 00:04:57.964
Can't keep God waiting.

00:05:09.475 --> 00:05:10.810
Ric the Vic.

00:05:10.893 --> 00:05:13.396
You're here! Thank God. [chuckles]

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:16.774
Not as a favor though.
I'm getting paid, or I'm going to bed.

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:19.610
Of course you are getting paid.

00:05:19.694 --> 00:05:21.821
This visit is strictly professional.

00:05:21.904 --> 00:05:24.365
Unless you, um, wanna get a drink after.

00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:26.951
Tell me what's going on.
Why have I been summoned?

00:05:27.535 --> 00:05:30.580
The usual reason. I have a soul in need.

00:05:30.663 --> 00:05:31.622
Who is she?

00:05:32.373 --> 00:05:33.708
[Erica] Hmm? [chuckles]

00:05:33.791 --> 00:05:35.209
Does it matter? [chuckles]

00:05:36.294 --> 00:05:37.962
If I double your fee?

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:41.716
Triple it?

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:45.595
Her family has means.

00:05:47.889 --> 00:05:50.933
If her family is in any way royal,
the answer is no.

00:05:51.017 --> 00:05:52.935
I'm done with that lot. I told the queen--

00:05:53.019 --> 00:05:54.937
The queen doesn't know she's here.

00:05:55.897 --> 00:05:57.148
Is it the princess?

00:05:57.231 --> 00:05:58.566
She showed up about an hour ago

00:05:58.649 --> 00:06:01.611
demanding I that marry them
before the palace find out, and the press.

00:06:01.694 --> 00:06:03.029
Why, who's she marrying?

00:06:03.112 --> 00:06:05.490
-Kevin Brody.
-Kevin Brody, the footballer?

00:06:06.115 --> 00:06:08.284
-He's rubbish.
-He's fit though.

00:06:08.868 --> 00:06:10.745
Just because
a Goldsmiths-educated princess

00:06:10.828 --> 00:06:12.372
wants to marry some naff winger,

00:06:12.455 --> 00:06:14.957
-does not mean she needs an exorcist.
-It's not just that.

00:06:15.041 --> 00:06:17.126
Just have a chat with her, you'll see.

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:19.504
-No, it's too risky with the royals.
-But…

00:06:19.587 --> 00:06:21.923
If our chat goes wrong,
I've a dead princess on my hand,

00:06:22.006 --> 00:06:24.258
a demon on the loose,
and no one to pay my fee.

00:06:24.842 --> 00:06:26.844
-[princess] Fuck off!
-Jesus fuck.

00:06:26.928 --> 00:06:29.639
-[princess] What are you doing to me?
-Is that her?

00:06:30.515 --> 00:06:32.141
Can you not smell the sulfur?

00:06:33.559 --> 00:06:35.269
[princess continues shouting]

00:06:37.605 --> 00:06:39.857
-Where is she?
-Thank you. She's in my office.

00:06:39.941 --> 00:06:41.943
You're gonna need the Rituale Romanum.

00:06:42.026 --> 00:06:44.153
I can't barge in spouting Latin at her.

00:06:44.237 --> 00:06:46.989
Has she been restrained,
or is that why she sounds like that?

00:06:47.073 --> 00:06:50.243
She sounds like that
'cause she's possessed by a fucking demon.

00:06:50.827 --> 00:06:55.206
[sighs] Can we at least drug her first?
Get her drunk, tie her up a little bit?

00:06:55.289 --> 00:06:56.916
She's British royalty.

00:06:56.999 --> 00:06:58.042
They love that shit.

00:06:58.584 --> 00:07:00.169
Any other ideas?

00:07:00.253 --> 00:07:01.504
Yeah.

00:07:03.548 --> 00:07:04.549
Take your top off.

00:07:09.345 --> 00:07:12.348
Do you, Princess, take this--

00:07:12.432 --> 00:07:13.433
[princess] I do.

00:07:16.769 --> 00:07:19.439
Wait, babe, are you
absolutely sure you wanna do this?

00:07:21.482 --> 00:07:23.234
I said "I do" because I do, Kevin.

00:07:23.317 --> 00:07:27.780
No, I mean, you sure you don't want a big
royal-wedding-of-the-century type wedding?

00:07:28.364 --> 00:07:30.533
With the queen
and photographers and stuff?

00:07:31.659 --> 00:07:32.702
I just want you.

00:07:35.872 --> 00:07:37.165
Get on with it, please.

00:07:37.248 --> 00:07:39.208
-Do you, Kevin, take--
-[bones crunch]

00:07:39.292 --> 00:07:40.960
Ow. Yeah, yeah, I do.

00:07:41.043 --> 00:07:42.670
[Johanna] Then repeat after me.

00:07:43.212 --> 00:07:44.380
[speaking Latin]

00:07:49.677 --> 00:07:50.511
[groans]

00:07:51.095 --> 00:07:52.180
[coughs]

00:07:52.263 --> 00:07:53.723
[Kevin chuckles]

00:07:53.806 --> 00:07:56.225
Sorry, I've been fasting. [chuckles]

00:07:57.477 --> 00:08:00.646
Just in case there were photographers.
You know what I'm saying?

00:08:02.148 --> 00:08:04.400
-Doesn't matter.
-[princess] Keep going.

00:08:04.484 --> 00:08:05.902
[speaking Latin]

00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:08.154
[groans]

00:08:08.237 --> 00:08:09.405
Sorry, can we--

00:08:09.489 --> 00:08:11.699
[continues speaking Latin]

00:08:11.782 --> 00:08:13.993
Are you going to be sick? Kevin?

00:08:14.076 --> 00:08:16.245
Are you going to be sick
during our wedding?

00:08:16.329 --> 00:08:18.706
[continues speaking Latin]

00:08:19.582 --> 00:08:20.583
Kevin.

00:08:23.669 --> 00:08:25.379
[continues speaking Latin]

00:08:31.052 --> 00:08:32.470
[demon growling]

00:08:40.311 --> 00:08:41.521
[princess crying]

00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:43.064
Ric!

00:08:49.278 --> 00:08:51.531
You were right about the demon,
wrong about the host.

00:08:51.614 --> 00:08:53.157
-Fuckin' hell.
-Get her out.

00:08:53.241 --> 00:08:54.700
[princess] My God! Kevin…

00:08:54.784 --> 00:08:56.911
Come on, love. Come on.

00:08:56.994 --> 00:08:58.829
-Come with me.
-[speaking Latin]

00:09:00.998 --> 00:09:01.999
[demon grunts]

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.462
You… talk too much.

00:09:06.546 --> 00:09:09.340
-Tell me your name and I'll stop.
-Why would I do that?

00:09:09.423 --> 00:09:13.135
When there are
far more enjoyable ways to make you stop.

00:09:13.219 --> 00:09:14.804
[Dream] His name is Agilieth.

00:09:18.099 --> 00:09:19.684
I'm flattered you remember me,

00:09:20.643 --> 00:09:23.896
Lord Morpheus, after all your time away.

00:09:25.231 --> 00:09:26.065
Lord Morpheus?

00:09:26.774 --> 00:09:27.692
[Agilieth] He is.

00:09:27.775 --> 00:09:32.154
Though, I confess, I almost
didn't recognize you without your helm.

00:09:32.238 --> 00:09:34.282
I wonder where your helm could be.

00:09:34.365 --> 00:09:37.785
I presume it is in Hell,
with the demon to whom it was traded.

00:09:37.868 --> 00:09:42.331
Yes, but which demon?
Give me the princess and I'll tell you.

00:09:42.415 --> 00:09:44.667
[speaking Latin]

00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:45.626
Wait.

00:09:46.836 --> 00:09:48.045
Fine, fine!

00:09:48.129 --> 00:09:50.798
I'll tell you where your helm is,
just don't send me back.

00:09:50.881 --> 00:09:52.550
[speaking Latin]

00:09:52.633 --> 00:09:54.927
-Constantine. Stop!
-[continues speaking Latin]

00:09:55.011 --> 00:09:56.053
[Dream] I command you!

00:09:57.847 --> 00:09:59.932
-Dream of the Endless commands you!
-[Dream] Stop!

00:10:00.016 --> 00:10:01.934
Run along and fuck off back to Hell.

00:10:02.768 --> 00:10:04.186
[screaming]

00:10:09.942 --> 00:10:11.902
You have no idea what you've done.

00:10:15.072 --> 00:10:16.032
I do though.

00:10:17.742 --> 00:10:19.285
I've just tripled my fee.

00:10:23.039 --> 00:10:27.710
Oi, Ric! Whom do I invoice for this,
Church of England or Buckingham Palace?

00:10:30.504 --> 00:10:33.424
-Is this a test? Are you testing me?
-[Ethel] No.

00:10:34.467 --> 00:10:37.178
You're usually so careful
not to mention it.

00:10:37.261 --> 00:10:40.181
I assumed it was
because my doctors told you not to.

00:10:42.141 --> 00:10:43.601
So why now? What's happened?

00:10:46.187 --> 00:10:47.355
You stole from him.

00:10:48.481 --> 00:10:50.024
Nothing's happened. I just--

00:10:50.107 --> 00:10:51.942
Do you think I don't know
when you're lying?

00:10:52.026 --> 00:10:54.945
Look, let's just say
that I have it on good authority

00:10:55.029 --> 00:11:00.159
that the ruby's owner is coming for it
and for the people who stole it from him.

00:11:00.951 --> 00:11:01.994
Then he's coming for you.

00:11:02.078 --> 00:11:05.539
-You're the one who stole it from him.
-And you're the one who stole it from me.

00:11:07.208 --> 00:11:09.460
You're the only one who knows where it is.

00:11:10.086 --> 00:11:11.462
He is coming, John.

00:11:11.545 --> 00:11:13.297
You've been saying that for years.

00:11:13.381 --> 00:11:14.840
Yes, but this time, it--

00:11:14.924 --> 00:11:15.800
Every time,

00:11:15.883 --> 00:11:20.012
every time you moved us to a new town
and changed our last name,

00:11:20.096 --> 00:11:23.349
wasn't because your boyfriend of the time
was beating the shit out of us,

00:11:23.432 --> 00:11:25.393
it was because the Sandman was coming--

00:11:25.476 --> 00:11:27.770
-I was trying to protect you.
-From whom?

00:11:28.979 --> 00:11:30.189
The Sandman?

00:11:31.899 --> 00:11:33.693
Or from my father?

00:11:35.486 --> 00:11:38.948
I told you, John,
your father died when you were a baby.

00:11:39.031 --> 00:11:41.617
Yes. You've been
saying that for years too,

00:11:41.701 --> 00:11:44.078
but you lie about everything,
lie for a living,

00:11:44.161 --> 00:11:47.039
you're Ethel Cripps, Ethel Dee,
you're Madame Daudet,

00:11:47.123 --> 00:11:51.001
and apparently,
I'm a man called John Burgess.

00:11:53.629 --> 00:11:54.547
[scoffs]

00:11:54.630 --> 00:11:56.257
Who told you that?

00:11:59.343 --> 00:12:04.014
The one… good thing about being in prison,

00:12:05.433 --> 00:12:08.561
you do have plenty of time to read,
and according to this,

00:12:09.395 --> 00:12:13.399
according to
"The History of Ritual Magic in England,"

00:12:14.024 --> 00:12:19.405
the ruby once belonged to a rival of
Aleister Crowley called Roderick Burgess.

00:12:20.156 --> 00:12:21.699
He also kept a mistress

00:12:23.159 --> 00:12:25.369
called Ethel Cripps.

00:12:26.078 --> 00:12:29.540
My father didn't die
when I was a baby, did he?

00:12:29.623 --> 00:12:31.459
My father was Roderick Burgess.

00:12:31.542 --> 00:12:35.755
Your father was a cunt
who wanted me to abort you.

00:12:38.007 --> 00:12:42.011
That may be the first honest thing
you've ever said to me.

00:12:44.722 --> 00:12:46.390
You want me to give you the ruby?

00:12:47.224 --> 00:12:48.809
Then you tell me everything.

00:12:49.935 --> 00:12:51.896
And this time, you tell me the truth.

00:12:56.192 --> 00:13:00.237
Yeah. The duke and duchess are
on their way to pick up the princess.

00:13:00.321 --> 00:13:01.238
Poor thing.

00:13:02.782 --> 00:13:04.450
She did seem possessed.

00:13:04.533 --> 00:13:05.367
She was.

00:13:06.535 --> 00:13:08.037
Love fucks you up.

00:13:08.954 --> 00:13:11.165
Your new man is not unfit.

00:13:14.752 --> 00:13:18.047
He's not my man. He's not even a man.

00:13:20.049 --> 00:13:21.008
What is he then?

00:13:23.969 --> 00:13:25.179
He's Endless.

00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:37.733
I said the Sandman,
and I meant the bleedin' Sandman.

00:13:38.526 --> 00:13:40.402
It's good to have you back, milord.

00:13:41.362 --> 00:13:42.905
Don't let her mess you about.

00:13:45.282 --> 00:13:47.952
My gran used to
tell me stories about you lot.

00:13:48.702 --> 00:13:50.830
I've known your family for centuries.

00:13:50.913 --> 00:13:53.499
Then you know there's not
one of us that can be trusted.

00:13:57.336 --> 00:13:58.587
What do you want with me?

00:14:00.089 --> 00:14:02.424
Something of mine
came into your possession.

00:14:03.467 --> 00:14:05.511
A leather pouch filled with sand.

00:14:06.178 --> 00:14:07.346
I need it back.

00:14:07.429 --> 00:14:08.430
Oh, that was yours?

00:14:10.349 --> 00:14:13.644
Bought it at an estate sale. Didn't even
manage to get the drawstrings open.

00:14:13.727 --> 00:14:15.020
Where is it?

00:14:15.729 --> 00:14:17.982
-No idea. Could be anywhere.
-We must find it.

00:14:18.065 --> 00:14:20.025
Must we? Why is that?

00:14:20.109 --> 00:14:22.278
Because without it,
my realm will cease to exist,

00:14:22.361 --> 00:14:24.738
and if dreams disappear,
then so will humanity.

00:14:25.948 --> 00:14:29.869
No offense, but…
I could do without dreams for a while.

00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:32.746
Haven't had
a decent night's sleep in ages.

00:14:32.830 --> 00:14:33.914
Nor will you.

00:14:34.874 --> 00:14:36.292
Until we find the sand.

00:14:36.876 --> 00:14:38.502
We must go, now.

00:14:39.753 --> 00:14:43.966
Does this approach generally work for you?
You just turn up and order people about?

00:14:44.049 --> 00:14:44.884
Yes.

00:14:48.345 --> 00:14:49.263
All right.

00:14:50.556 --> 00:14:52.016
-I'll help you find your sand.
-Good.

00:14:52.099 --> 00:14:54.310
-First thing tomorrow, and I work alone.
-No.

00:14:55.060 --> 00:14:57.438
Don't want you and your friend
following me all over London.

00:14:57.521 --> 00:14:59.273
-My friend?
-Is that not your raven?

00:15:04.653 --> 00:15:07.990
-My gran said Dream always had a raven.
-Not anymore.

00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:17.041
Who are you?

00:15:20.878 --> 00:15:21.837
Tell me your name.

00:15:23.047 --> 00:15:25.007
It's, uh, Matthew, sir.

00:15:28.135 --> 00:15:31.221
Matthew, I've made it clear to Lucienne

00:15:31.305 --> 00:15:33.807
that I do not require
a raven at this time.

00:15:33.891 --> 00:15:36.268
Yeah, she told me you'd say that. [caws]

00:15:36.352 --> 00:15:40.105
-If I need assistance, I will ask for it.
-Uh, you do, actually… [caws]

00:15:40.189 --> 00:15:41.815
She's getting away. Sir, she…

00:15:45.611 --> 00:15:48.155
See, this… this is why you need a raven.

00:15:48.739 --> 00:15:50.491
Go back to the Dreaming, Matthew.

00:15:55.245 --> 00:15:59.249
The only reason I stole the tools
was because I thought they'd help us.

00:15:59.333 --> 00:16:04.296
Then your father's men
came after us, so I hid the ruby,

00:16:05.464 --> 00:16:07.716
and traded the others…

00:16:11.303 --> 00:16:12.346
for this.

00:16:14.181 --> 00:16:15.099
[chuckling softly]

00:16:19.728 --> 00:16:21.438
The Amulet of Protection.

00:16:22.439 --> 00:16:25.192
It's what's kept me alive all these years.

00:16:26.485 --> 00:16:28.570
But it won't do the same for you.

00:16:29.196 --> 00:16:31.156
That's why I need the ruby, John.

00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:36.996
Even if I told you where it was,
it wouldn't do any good. I've altered it.

00:16:39.456 --> 00:16:41.250
It only works for me now.

00:16:43.168 --> 00:16:46.296
You don't believe me,
you can try to use it. See what happens.

00:16:47.631 --> 00:16:49.883
John, I have no intention of using it.

00:16:50.426 --> 00:16:52.302
I want us to give it back to him.

00:16:53.846 --> 00:16:56.306
-Maybe he'll forgive us.
-Maybe.

00:16:58.642 --> 00:17:01.395
But maybe we shouldn't give away a jewel

00:17:02.021 --> 00:17:03.647
that makes dreams come true,

00:17:03.731 --> 00:17:07.443
when we could use it to
dream of a world without the Sandman.

00:17:10.738 --> 00:17:12.197
We could start again.

00:17:19.204 --> 00:17:20.205
[wings flapping]

00:17:24.043 --> 00:17:25.002
[Matthew] I'm back.

00:17:26.879 --> 00:17:30.382
Yes, in spite of my telling you to leave.

00:17:30.966 --> 00:17:33.677
I… I can't. I… The boss lady told me--

00:17:33.761 --> 00:17:35.596
Lucienne is not your master.

00:17:36.555 --> 00:17:38.140
She told me you'd say that too.

00:17:39.975 --> 00:17:41.477
Do you know who I am?

00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:44.271
Not entirely, but I… [sighs]

00:17:44.354 --> 00:17:46.273
I don't even know who I am anymore.

00:17:46.356 --> 00:17:49.568
A couple hours ago,
I apparently died in my sleep,

00:17:49.651 --> 00:17:51.695
and now I… I'm a bird.

00:17:51.779 --> 00:17:54.990
I… I used to have thumbs.
Now, I have these things.

00:17:55.741 --> 00:17:59.036
Yes. And you must use them
to fly back to the Dreaming.

00:18:00.245 --> 00:18:03.499
-This world is not safe.
-You think I don't know that?

00:18:03.582 --> 00:18:07.211
I lived my whole life here.
That's why Lucienne sent me to help you.

00:18:08.003 --> 00:18:09.797
My last raven came here to help me.

00:18:10.547 --> 00:18:12.424
Yeah? Where is he now?

00:18:14.259 --> 00:18:15.636
Her name was Jessamy.

00:18:17.429 --> 00:18:20.891
She died. Trying to help me.

00:18:23.060 --> 00:18:24.394
[clicks tongue] I'm sorry.

00:18:25.104 --> 00:18:28.232
Look, let me at least
help you find this woman.

00:18:28.315 --> 00:18:29.191
If she's asleep,

00:18:29.274 --> 00:18:32.653
we've probably got five or six hours
before she's on the move again.

00:18:34.822 --> 00:18:38.117
If she is asleep,
then I know exactly where to find her.

00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:40.202
[intense music playing]

00:19:00.097 --> 00:19:02.099
[Johanna speaking Latin]

00:19:17.489 --> 00:19:18.991
Johanna!

00:19:19.074 --> 00:19:21.952
Astra! Astra! Go back, now!

00:19:22.661 --> 00:19:24.580
[continues speaking Latin]

00:19:24.663 --> 00:19:26.915
-No! [screaming]
-Astra!

00:19:26.999 --> 00:19:27.833
No!

00:19:28.417 --> 00:19:29.334
[speaking Latin]

00:19:34.173 --> 00:19:35.215
Don't let go!

00:19:37.092 --> 00:19:39.303
Astra! Astra!

00:19:39.386 --> 00:19:41.263
-No!
-[Astra screaming]

00:19:54.568 --> 00:19:56.862
[breathing heavily]

00:20:06.121 --> 00:20:06.955
[sighs]

00:20:07.039 --> 00:20:08.457
For fuck's sake.

00:20:11.376 --> 00:20:12.794
How did you find me?

00:20:14.755 --> 00:20:16.048
You were dreaming.

00:20:17.758 --> 00:20:20.219
But it wasn't only a dream, was it?

00:20:20.302 --> 00:20:21.178
It's a memory.

00:20:21.803 --> 00:20:23.263
No wonder you do not sleep.

00:20:23.847 --> 00:20:25.265
Maybe I don't deserve to.

00:20:26.266 --> 00:20:27.309
Perhaps not.

00:20:29.811 --> 00:20:31.188
But I could make it go away.

00:20:32.272 --> 00:20:34.024
Only if I help you find your sand.

00:20:35.734 --> 00:20:38.737
Though, finding anything
in this place may require more magic

00:20:38.820 --> 00:20:40.280
than even you can muster.

00:20:46.954 --> 00:20:48.163
I'll look in the office.

00:20:49.665 --> 00:20:52.542
-Try not to clean up while I'm gone.
-I'm coming with you.

00:20:53.669 --> 00:20:55.796
You have a gift for disappearing.

00:20:56.964 --> 00:20:57.839
All right.

00:20:59.466 --> 00:21:02.970
But if the mess in here offends you,
wait till you see my office.

00:21:06.139 --> 00:21:07.140
[objects clattering]

00:21:10.519 --> 00:21:12.854
[Dream] Why do you humans
love objects so much?

00:21:14.606 --> 00:21:16.275
They do come in handy sometimes.

00:21:18.110 --> 00:21:20.487
You seem pretty attached to your sand.

00:21:21.071 --> 00:21:23.156
It's not just an object,
it's a part of me.

00:21:23.949 --> 00:21:26.118
If that's true,
how'd you happen to lose it?

00:21:26.910 --> 00:21:30.330
It was stolen by
another magic user called Burgess.

00:21:31.707 --> 00:21:32.916
Wait, not Roderick Burgess?

00:21:34.459 --> 00:21:36.503
The old Demon King himself, eh?

00:21:36.586 --> 00:21:38.380
Everyone used to say he was a fake.

00:21:39.006 --> 00:21:42.134
Said he had the Devil locked up
in his basement. How the fuck did you…

00:21:49.516 --> 00:21:50.434
Shit.

00:21:55.939 --> 00:21:58.650
Wasn't the Devil he had
locked up in his basement, was it?

00:22:02.654 --> 00:22:05.991
Were you down there? All this time?

00:22:15.667 --> 00:22:16.918
[Dream] Is this you?

00:22:17.919 --> 00:22:20.756
Why? Do I look that different?

00:22:21.423 --> 00:22:23.258
Or younger?

00:22:25.427 --> 00:22:26.261
No.

00:22:27.637 --> 00:22:28.472
Happy.

00:22:33.560 --> 00:22:34.686
[sighs]

00:22:35.228 --> 00:22:36.188
Shit.

00:22:38.648 --> 00:22:39.983
I know where your sand is.

00:22:43.487 --> 00:22:45.072
[John] I've missed you, Mother.

00:22:47.199 --> 00:22:49.785
We were always very close, you and I.

00:22:49.868 --> 00:22:52.329
Especially when it was just the two of us.

00:22:52.412 --> 00:22:56.792
-It never was just the two of us, was it?
-Well, when you were between boyfriends.

00:22:56.875 --> 00:22:59.211
No. I meant the ruby.

00:23:01.922 --> 00:23:04.341
Well, you only ever
showed it to me on birthdays.

00:23:04.424 --> 00:23:07.260
You'd tell me to make a wish
and a pony would appear in the garden

00:23:07.344 --> 00:23:11.390
or there'd be snow
in… in July in my bedroom. [chuckles]

00:23:11.473 --> 00:23:13.809
[chuckling] I should never have done that.

00:23:14.393 --> 00:23:15.811
No, it was wonderful.

00:23:17.729 --> 00:23:19.689
I should never have stolen it from you.

00:23:19.773 --> 00:23:22.067
I should never have stolen it.

00:23:24.111 --> 00:23:26.863
You did what you had to do
to keep us both alive.

00:23:26.947 --> 00:23:28.615
I understand that now.

00:23:30.575 --> 00:23:33.328
And I'm just glad I can return the favor.

00:23:36.957 --> 00:23:38.667
If you bring me the ruby.

00:23:44.172 --> 00:23:46.007
I don't think that's a good idea.

00:23:46.716 --> 00:23:48.009
I told you I fixed it.

00:23:48.093 --> 00:23:50.971
The only reason those people
got hurt the last time was--

00:23:51.054 --> 00:23:54.307
People didn't get hurt, John. People died.

00:23:54.391 --> 00:23:55.767
You killed them.

00:23:55.851 --> 00:23:59.438
They were trying to take it from me.
I was defending myself.

00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:04.151
And now I can use it to defend you.

00:24:04.234 --> 00:24:06.361
But I don't need defending.

00:24:07.237 --> 00:24:10.323
I've got this.
It's you I'm trying to save.

00:24:10.407 --> 00:24:11.241
Is it?

00:24:13.034 --> 00:24:15.412
What can I do to make you believe me?

00:24:24.171 --> 00:24:25.589
[hesitates] What are you doing?

00:24:26.673 --> 00:24:28.800
What I should have done long ago.

00:24:29.926 --> 00:24:31.678
Protecting my son.

00:24:33.555 --> 00:24:36.308
If I give you this,
you won't need the ruby.

00:24:40.854 --> 00:24:44.191
Who is she? The woman in the picture.

00:24:45.275 --> 00:24:47.861
Her name's Rachel, Rachel Moodie.

00:24:47.944 --> 00:24:50.322
-Does she deal in magic as well?
-[scoffs]

00:24:50.405 --> 00:24:51.323
God, no.

00:24:52.032 --> 00:24:53.825
No, she's actually a decent person.

00:24:54.493 --> 00:24:56.661
Proper job, nice family.

00:24:57.954 --> 00:24:59.664
Fuckin' hated all the magic stuff.

00:25:00.248 --> 00:25:02.459
And yet you left the sand with her.

00:25:03.043 --> 00:25:04.669
No, I did not leave it with her.

00:25:05.670 --> 00:25:06.796
Sort of left it.

00:25:07.839 --> 00:25:08.757
And her.

00:25:13.553 --> 00:25:14.930
I was staying at her place.

00:25:15.013 --> 00:25:18.225
She interpreted that as
us living together, which we weren't, so,

00:25:19.226 --> 00:25:22.646
one night, I just went on a job
and… never went back.

00:25:22.729 --> 00:25:23.563
Why?

00:25:26.233 --> 00:25:28.068
Because it never ends well, does it?

00:25:29.319 --> 00:25:30.195
What?

00:25:32.572 --> 00:25:33.448
Love?

00:25:34.366 --> 00:25:36.660
No. I suppose it doesn't.

00:25:38.370 --> 00:25:39.621
I don't know if you've noticed,

00:25:39.704 --> 00:25:43.124
but people around me tend to get
ripped in half or cast down to Hell.

00:25:44.084 --> 00:25:45.418
Safer for her if I left.

00:25:46.044 --> 00:25:47.254
Did you tell her that?

00:25:48.129 --> 00:25:50.423
No. I suppose I'll have to now.

00:25:51.925 --> 00:25:53.802
This is her. Or it used to be.

00:25:53.885 --> 00:25:57.180
It's been six months.
Maybe she might've moved house.

00:25:57.264 --> 00:25:58.765
Please, have moved house.

00:25:59.641 --> 00:26:01.268
-Oh, bollocks.
-[doorbell buzzes]

00:26:05.772 --> 00:26:08.900
-Maybe we'll get lucky and she won't be--
-[door buzzes]

00:26:09.609 --> 00:26:12.070
That's weird.
She didn't even ask who it is.

00:26:13.446 --> 00:26:16.825
Maybe she's expecting someone.
This could get awkward.

00:26:16.908 --> 00:26:19.160
More… awkward.

00:26:21.621 --> 00:26:23.665
-Wait here. No, you're not.
-I'm coming with you.

00:26:24.749 --> 00:26:26.793
Do you have any idea
how much she probably hates me?

00:26:26.876 --> 00:26:28.503
Do you have any ex-girlfriends?

00:26:31.214 --> 00:26:33.049
-I will not wait long.
-You won't have to.

00:26:34.092 --> 00:26:39.472
She's gonna slam the door in my face,
like I'm about to do with you… right now.

00:26:46.062 --> 00:26:48.064
[somber music playing]

00:27:09.377 --> 00:27:10.378
[sighs]

00:27:10.462 --> 00:27:11.963
[softly] Just get on with it.

00:27:12.047 --> 00:27:14.049
[romantic song playing over speakers]

00:27:21.389 --> 00:27:23.600
-Oh, my God.
-Hiya, Rach.

00:27:26.728 --> 00:27:29.564
-What are you doing here?
-I probably should have called… first.

00:27:29.648 --> 00:27:30.523
Sorry. Um…

00:27:30.607 --> 00:27:31.775
[inhales deeply]

00:27:31.858 --> 00:27:33.068
[sighs]

00:27:36.112 --> 00:27:38.657
-Hi.
-Hi.

00:27:42.661 --> 00:27:43.870
[hesitates]

00:27:43.953 --> 00:27:47.624
I had all of these, um… things planned,
what I wanted to say.

00:27:47.707 --> 00:27:51.252
Go on then. Don't let me stop you.

00:27:53.838 --> 00:27:54.881
You look well.

00:27:56.132 --> 00:27:57.300
You look well.

00:27:59.010 --> 00:28:00.178
Uh, right, well, um…

00:28:01.346 --> 00:28:02.347
Sorry to bother you.

00:28:02.430 --> 00:28:05.642
I left some things behind
when we broke up, and I was wondering if--

00:28:05.725 --> 00:28:09.771
Did we… break up… exactly?

00:28:09.854 --> 00:28:11.981
Yeah. Uh, no, fair point.

00:28:13.108 --> 00:28:15.860
That was bad of me, and… wrong.

00:28:16.653 --> 00:28:18.988
I should have phoned or at least texted.

00:28:20.573 --> 00:28:21.741
Do you wanna come in?

00:28:23.243 --> 00:28:24.786
And apologize properly?

00:28:27.247 --> 00:28:29.457
[Matthew] I say this as someone
who was recently human.

00:28:29.541 --> 00:28:32.377
Human beings cannot be trusted.

00:28:32.919 --> 00:28:33.920
No.

00:28:34.003 --> 00:28:37.549
If I were Johanna Constantine,
I'd be up there cutting a deal with Rachel

00:28:37.632 --> 00:28:40.969
to keep the sand,
then cut the dream sand with real sand

00:28:41.052 --> 00:28:42.846
and sell it to the highest bidder.

00:28:43.805 --> 00:28:46.516
But then, I wasn't the best person
when I was a person.

00:28:47.058 --> 00:28:50.437
We can't all be Jessamy,
who was apparently perfect in every way.

00:28:50.520 --> 00:28:51.354
Matthew, I--

00:28:51.438 --> 00:28:54.691
No, I get that you don't think
you need a raven, but if you're out here,

00:28:54.774 --> 00:28:57.652
waiting for human beings
to help anyone but themselves,

00:28:57.736 --> 00:29:00.905
you're gonna be
sitting out here in the rain forever.

00:29:01.740 --> 00:29:04.784
Whatever they're doing up there,
they're not thinking about you.

00:29:16.337 --> 00:29:17.172
Shall we, um,

00:29:18.006 --> 00:29:19.799
take this apology into the bedroom?

00:29:22.594 --> 00:29:23.803
It's going well, isn't it?

00:29:23.887 --> 00:29:27.766
Yes, but you have a lot to apologize for.

00:29:33.229 --> 00:29:34.105
[Johanna sighs]

00:29:35.899 --> 00:29:36.816
I know.

00:29:37.859 --> 00:29:39.736
-When you left that night--
-[sighs] Rach.

00:29:39.819 --> 00:29:41.988
-When you left that night…
-Do we have to?

00:29:42.071 --> 00:29:43.490
…and you didn't come home,

00:29:44.908 --> 00:29:46.075
I was terrified.

00:29:48.161 --> 00:29:49.329
I'm sorry.

00:29:49.412 --> 00:29:50.705
I called everyone.

00:29:50.789 --> 00:29:53.124
Chas and Renee, Ric the Vic.

00:29:54.584 --> 00:29:56.002
I even called your exes.

00:29:58.004 --> 00:29:59.005
You did not.

00:30:01.090 --> 00:30:01.925
Which ones?

00:30:02.801 --> 00:30:03.802
Sarah.

00:30:06.387 --> 00:30:07.931
-Oliver.
-Oh, shit.

00:30:08.807 --> 00:30:09.808
And Kit Ryan.

00:30:13.895 --> 00:30:16.022
But they all told me to just get over you.

00:30:17.482 --> 00:30:22.737
Because you're a selfish, ruthless coward.

00:30:28.535 --> 00:30:30.578
Who ruins everything she touches.

00:30:37.168 --> 00:30:39.170
-Rach.
-[Dream] Constantine.

00:30:40.046 --> 00:30:40.880
Wake up.

00:30:43.633 --> 00:30:44.634
[gasps softly]

00:30:49.639 --> 00:30:51.224
What did you do to me?

00:30:52.517 --> 00:30:54.018
It was the sand.

00:30:56.229 --> 00:30:57.230
Where's Rachel?

00:31:03.945 --> 00:31:04.904
Rachel?

00:31:07.532 --> 00:31:09.200
-Rach?
-[Rachel] Jo?

00:31:10.451 --> 00:31:12.954
Jo? Is that you?

00:31:16.124 --> 00:31:18.376
That's such a wonderful dream.

00:31:20.545 --> 00:31:22.255
[Rachel groaning]

00:31:33.266 --> 00:31:34.517
What's happened to her?

00:31:36.227 --> 00:31:38.187
It was not meant for humans.

00:31:38.855 --> 00:31:41.190
[crying] No, no! No, give it back.

00:31:41.774 --> 00:31:44.986
Please. [groans] It hurts.

00:31:47.989 --> 00:31:49.032
We can go.

00:31:49.866 --> 00:31:50.742
What?

00:31:52.619 --> 00:31:54.704
What? We can't go.
We can't leave her like this.

00:31:56.205 --> 00:31:57.665
We can't help her.

00:31:58.625 --> 00:32:00.919
The sand was the only thing
keeping her alive.

00:32:02.295 --> 00:32:03.963
[Rachel whimpering]

00:32:04.047 --> 00:32:05.340
You have to do something.

00:32:06.633 --> 00:32:08.843
If it wasn't for your sand,
she wouldn't be like this.

00:32:08.927 --> 00:32:10.428
I'm not the one who left her with it.

00:32:12.347 --> 00:32:13.681
What is wrong with you?

00:32:15.558 --> 00:32:19.646
You want your sand back so that you can
save all of humanity, well, here she is!

00:32:20.980 --> 00:32:23.399
But we're all just
Roderick Burgess to you.

00:32:25.318 --> 00:32:28.696
All you care about
is your sand. Your power.

00:32:31.824 --> 00:32:33.201
What is the point of you?

00:32:38.790 --> 00:32:42.335
Well, you got your sand back.
Why are you still here if you won't help?

00:32:58.351 --> 00:32:59.227
Wait outside.

00:33:10.697 --> 00:33:11.656
[softly] Rach…

00:33:13.950 --> 00:33:16.995
I'm sorry, Jo. I'm so sorry.

00:33:20.415 --> 00:33:21.457
It's my fault.

00:33:23.376 --> 00:33:24.377
All of it.

00:33:26.879 --> 00:33:28.464
Should never have left it with you.

00:33:32.593 --> 00:33:33.761
Should never have left.

00:33:34.345 --> 00:33:37.932
Well, you came back, though. Didn't you?

00:33:58.161 --> 00:33:59.454
[groans]

00:33:59.537 --> 00:34:01.539
[dramatic music playing]

00:34:14.635 --> 00:34:15.928
[gasps]

00:34:16.012 --> 00:34:18.014
[music intensifies]

00:34:42.121 --> 00:34:44.123
[melancholy music playing]

00:35:04.936 --> 00:35:07.313
No. No, put it back on.

00:35:07.980 --> 00:35:11.400
I've seen what happens to people who get
on the wrong side of you and that thing.

00:35:11.484 --> 00:35:15.196
I am trying to save you,
not hurt you. Here.

00:35:16.823 --> 00:35:20.868
This kept me alive for 116 years so far.

00:35:21.536 --> 00:35:23.871
I hope it keeps you alive forever.

00:35:25.373 --> 00:35:28.668
It's all a mother wants, really. Take it.

00:35:34.382 --> 00:35:35.466
[sniffles]

00:35:41.931 --> 00:35:42.849
[crying]

00:35:45.017 --> 00:35:46.352
One last thing.

00:35:48.521 --> 00:35:49.689
[sniffling]

00:35:57.155 --> 00:36:00.616
I'm sorry I was such a shit mum.

00:36:06.455 --> 00:36:08.499
No. Mother.

00:36:10.543 --> 00:36:11.627
Take it back.

00:36:12.545 --> 00:36:14.422
It's too late now, love.

00:36:15.131 --> 00:36:16.090
No.

00:36:18.759 --> 00:36:19.719
Guard!

00:36:20.761 --> 00:36:21.762
Mother.

00:36:24.015 --> 00:36:25.975
[weakly] You don't need the ruby.

00:36:27.560 --> 00:36:31.105
No one can hurt you now.

00:36:31.939 --> 00:36:33.357
[door unlocks]

00:36:36.277 --> 00:36:37.445
[Sam] What did you do to her?

00:36:37.528 --> 00:36:39.447
Nothing. I didn't do anything.

00:36:41.240 --> 00:36:43.993
[Sam] I need you
to step away from her. Okay?

00:36:45.870 --> 00:36:48.998
You don't want to
point that gun at me, I promise you.

00:36:49.081 --> 00:36:50.750
[Sam] Security requesting backup.

00:36:55.046 --> 00:36:57.715
Why don't you just let me go?

00:36:59.300 --> 00:37:00.426
For your own sake.

00:37:00.509 --> 00:37:03.763
I'm warning you, John, I will shoot.

00:37:03.846 --> 00:37:06.015
You'll only be hurting yourself.

00:37:07.767 --> 00:37:08.976
I'm sorry.

00:37:12.813 --> 00:37:15.066

Don't you fucking move!

[elevator dings]

00:38:27.596 --> 00:38:30.433
[Corinthian] It's too cold
for you to be out here without a coat.

00:38:34.312 --> 00:38:36.314
[John] Well, that's very kind of you.

00:38:36.397 --> 00:38:40.651
No, please. I insist. Yeah.

00:38:43.029 --> 00:38:44.030
What about you?

00:38:44.113 --> 00:38:45.990
Oh, I don't mind the cold.

00:38:46.574 --> 00:38:48.659
There, much better.

00:38:52.038 --> 00:38:55.708
May I return it to you
when I get to where I'm going?

00:38:55.791 --> 00:38:59.378
The only thing that matters to me
is that you get to where you're going.

00:39:01.797 --> 00:39:02.631
Thank you.

00:39:03.883 --> 00:39:04.759
Thank you.

00:39:36.499 --> 00:39:39.919
She died in peace. In her sleep.

00:39:45.424 --> 00:39:46.717
I'll let her dad know.

00:39:52.098 --> 00:39:54.183
You know, she was actually a good person.

00:39:56.352 --> 00:39:58.562
There are a few of them
out there, you know.

00:39:59.355 --> 00:40:01.565
They're not all like me
and Roderick Burgess.

00:40:02.108 --> 00:40:04.276
You are not Roderick Burgess.

00:40:17.248 --> 00:40:18.249
[Matthew caws]

00:40:20.126 --> 00:40:21.669
And what's your friend's name?

00:40:25.798 --> 00:40:30.010
-His name is Matthew, but he is not my--
-Look after him, Matthew.

00:40:33.556 --> 00:40:34.682
He needs it.

00:40:42.565 --> 00:40:44.108
Constantine!

00:40:46.360 --> 00:40:48.654
That nightmare won't trouble you anymore.

00:40:57.037 --> 00:40:59.957
That was… nice, what you did up there.

00:41:00.040 --> 00:41:02.084
Don't ever spy on me again.

00:41:02.751 --> 00:41:03.878
I wasn't spying.

00:41:03.961 --> 00:41:06.088
If I were spying on you,
you'd never know it.

00:41:07.631 --> 00:41:08.841
So what's our next move?

00:41:10.759 --> 00:41:12.720
I'm going in search of my helm.

00:41:12.803 --> 00:41:14.889
And you are going to the Dreaming.

00:41:14.972 --> 00:41:17.933
Or, hear me out,
you could take me with you,

00:41:18.017 --> 00:41:20.936
and we'll never have to
have this conversation ever again.

00:41:23.564 --> 00:41:24.899
That does sound tempting.

00:41:30.613 --> 00:41:35.743
In fact, where I am going,
I may have need of you.

00:41:35.826 --> 00:41:37.369
Yeah? Where are we going?

00:41:39.371 --> 00:41:40.372
Hell.

00:41:41.373 --> 00:41:46.212
Hell. As in Hell-Hell,
or were you being metaphorical?

00:41:46.295 --> 00:41:49.798
Because either way, we should probably
check in with Lucienne first, right?

00:41:49.882 --> 00:41:51.800
See how she's feeling about it.

00:41:51.884 --> 00:41:54.637
I'm gonna go out on a limb,
which is something birds actually do,

00:41:54.720 --> 00:41:58.265
and say she will
not be in favor of Hell-going.

00:41:58.349 --> 00:42:03.270
But I don't get a sense you're listening,
so, fuck it, let's go to Hell!

00:42:08.943 --> 00:42:10.945
[theme music playing]
