WEBVTT

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:19.894
[Dream] We begin…

00:00:20.603 --> 00:00:22.605
[enchanting music playing]

00:00:25.734 --> 00:00:27.235
…in the waking world,

00:00:29.487 --> 00:00:33.616
which humanity insists
on calling the real world…

00:00:36.369 --> 00:00:40.040
as if your dreams have no effect
upon the choices you make.

00:00:41.791 --> 00:00:44.335
You mortals go about your work,

00:00:45.086 --> 00:00:47.380
your loves, your wars,

00:00:47.464 --> 00:00:51.050
as if your waking lives
are all that matter.

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:58.475
But there is another life which awaits you
when you close your eyes…

00:01:03.063 --> 00:01:04.856
and enter my realm.

00:01:11.071 --> 00:01:16.076
For I am the King of Dreams…

00:01:17.202 --> 00:01:18.036
[screeches]

00:01:19.204 --> 00:01:20.789
…and Nightmares.

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:31.841
When the waking world
leaves you wanting and weary,

00:01:32.634 --> 00:01:35.011
sleep brings you here

00:01:36.513 --> 00:01:40.517
to find freedom and adventure.

00:01:51.402 --> 00:01:55.281
To face your fears and fantasies

00:01:55.365 --> 00:01:59.994
in Dreams and Nightmares that I create…

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:03.915
and which I must control,

00:02:05.625 --> 00:02:09.170
lest they consume and destroy you.

00:02:10.338 --> 00:02:13.216
That is my purpose and my function.

00:02:14.342 --> 00:02:15.510
Or it was,

00:02:16.094 --> 00:02:19.722
until I left my kingdom
to pursue a rogue Nightmare.

00:02:23.685 --> 00:02:27.438
My Lord, you are coming back, aren't you?

00:02:28.022 --> 00:02:30.108
[Dream] Why would I not return, Lucienne?

00:02:30.191 --> 00:02:32.652
I don't know, a presentiment.

00:02:33.403 --> 00:02:36.197
As powerful as you are here in your realm,

00:02:37.323 --> 00:02:40.076
Dreams rarely survive in the waking world.

00:02:40.827 --> 00:02:44.998
Nightmares, on the other hand,
seem to thrive there.

00:02:52.255 --> 00:02:55.300
Wake up, sir, we're here. Fawney Rig.

00:02:56.175 --> 00:02:57.176
Already?

00:02:58.428 --> 00:03:00.096
I must have dozed off.

00:03:01.222 --> 00:03:02.140
Thank you.

00:03:10.273 --> 00:03:12.275
[suspenseful music playing]

00:03:20.825 --> 00:03:22.744
[engine starts]

00:03:43.848 --> 00:03:44.891
[doorbell rings]

00:03:49.896 --> 00:03:51.064
Oh.

00:03:51.147 --> 00:03:55.026
Good afternoon, lad.
My name is Dr. John Hathaway.

00:03:56.361 --> 00:03:57.946
Of the Royal Museum?

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:00.406
Are you here to see the Magus?

00:04:01.366 --> 00:04:04.619
Well, I've come
to see Mr. Roderick Burgess.

00:04:08.665 --> 00:04:11.918
Father likes to be called Magus.
It means sorcerer.

00:04:12.502 --> 00:04:13.336
Hmm.

00:04:15.046 --> 00:04:17.131
[door creaks]

00:04:17.215 --> 00:04:18.049
[door closes]

00:04:35.441 --> 00:04:41.698
[people chanting] Here in the darkness.
Here in the darkness.

00:04:42.407 --> 00:04:48.496
Here in the darkness.
Here in the darkness.

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:53.293
The Magus will receive his guest
in the study, Alex.

00:04:53.876 --> 00:04:55.837
Yes, Mr. Sykes.

00:05:03.344 --> 00:05:05.221
Have you come to join Father's Order?

00:05:07.765 --> 00:05:09.726
The Order of Ancient Mysteries.

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:14.063
Dr. Hathaway, what an unexpected pleasure.

00:05:14.731 --> 00:05:16.774
Alex, tea for our guest.

00:05:16.858 --> 00:05:19.902
Please, sit down.
You must be exhausted from your journey.

00:05:20.486 --> 00:05:21.321
Thank you.

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:24.407
I take it you've reconsidered, then?

00:05:25.158 --> 00:05:26.909
After our meeting at the museum…

00:05:27.618 --> 00:05:29.078
I know what I said.

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:32.582
I received a telegram this morning.

00:05:32.665 --> 00:05:34.917
My son, Edmund,

00:05:36.127 --> 00:05:40.923
his destroyer was
sunk last week, off Jutland.

00:05:42.008 --> 00:05:43.634
Oh, my condolences, Doctor.

00:05:46.637 --> 00:05:47.972
We are bonded

00:05:49.057 --> 00:05:51.476
then, in our grief, you and I.

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:55.980
As you know, I lost my son Randall
recently at Gallipoli.

00:05:57.774 --> 00:05:58.733
Forgive me, I…

00:05:59.317 --> 00:06:02.820
I understood that
Randall was your only son.

00:06:06.449 --> 00:06:08.576
[Roderick] Randall was my greatest joy.

00:06:12.163 --> 00:06:14.916
All this was meant to be his. [chuckles]

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:21.464
So, have you brought it,
the Magdalene Grimoire?

00:06:30.431 --> 00:06:32.016
If I give you the book…

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:37.438
can you really…

00:06:38.064 --> 00:06:39.565
Capture the Angel of Death?

00:06:40.483 --> 00:06:41.609
Oh, yes.

00:06:43.945 --> 00:06:46.072
With the spells recorded in this book,

00:06:46.155 --> 00:06:49.450
we can compel Death
to return our sons to us.

00:06:50.159 --> 00:06:54.163
Your Edmund
and my Randall will live again.

00:06:56.916 --> 00:06:58.918
[eerie music playing]

00:07:22.442 --> 00:07:25.194
It's all right, Dr. Hathaway. Here.

00:07:46.466 --> 00:07:51.804
Tonight, we will achieve
what no one before us has even attempted.

00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:57.018
We will summon and imprison Death.

00:07:59.729 --> 00:08:01.647
Here in the darkness.

00:08:01.731 --> 00:08:03.608
[disciples] Here in the darkness.

00:08:07.361 --> 00:08:08.779
[engine idling]

00:08:10.531 --> 00:08:11.616
[man groans]

00:08:19.123 --> 00:08:20.208
[Dream] Corinthian.

00:08:24.337 --> 00:08:27.215
My creations stay in The Dreaming.

00:08:28.883 --> 00:08:32.637
They do not walk amongst the living,
killing mortals for pleasure.

00:08:34.013 --> 00:08:36.140
Isn't this why you created me?

00:08:37.183 --> 00:08:40.686
Why should we confine ourselves
to their sleeping minds?

00:08:40.770 --> 00:08:43.940
Here, in the waking world,
we're unstoppable.

00:08:44.690 --> 00:08:47.527
There is nothing preventing us from taking

00:08:48.694 --> 00:08:51.447
whoever, whatever we want.

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:53.699
[Dream] There is though.

00:08:56.744 --> 00:08:57.662
My Lord…

00:08:59.372 --> 00:09:00.790
Please, no.

00:09:01.457 --> 00:09:02.917
No, no, no, I beg you.

00:09:06.671 --> 00:09:07.672
[gasps]

00:09:07.755 --> 00:09:08.673
Please…

00:09:11.259 --> 00:09:12.260
[Dream gasps]

00:09:12.343 --> 00:09:15.471
[disciples chanting] Here in the darkness.

00:09:15.555 --> 00:09:18.432
[Dream groaning]

00:09:21.352 --> 00:09:22.687
[breathing heavily]

00:09:28.568 --> 00:09:32.446
I give you a coin made from a stone.

00:09:32.530 --> 00:09:34.615
[disciples] Here in the darkness.

00:09:34.699 --> 00:09:38.202
I give you a knife from under the hills,

00:09:39.203 --> 00:09:43.374
and I give you the blood
from out of my vein.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:45.668
[disciples] Here in the darkness.

00:09:45.751 --> 00:09:49.297
I give you a song I stole from the dirt,

00:09:49.964 --> 00:09:51.841
and I give you a feather

00:09:53.259 --> 00:09:55.678
pulled from an angel's wing,

00:09:55.761 --> 00:09:58.264
for you to lift up into the heavens.

00:10:00.683 --> 00:10:06.230
[disciples] Here in the darkness.
Here in the darkness.

00:10:08.357 --> 00:10:13.738
Here in the darkness.
Here in the darkness.

00:10:14.363 --> 00:10:16.991
[louder] Here in the darkness.
Here in the darkness.

00:10:17.074 --> 00:10:19.160
I summon you with poison.

00:10:20.244 --> 00:10:23.956
[disciples] Here in the darkness.
Here in the darkness.

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:26.584
I summon you with pain.

00:10:26.667 --> 00:10:28.961
[disciples] Here in the darkness.
Here in the darkness.

00:10:29.045 --> 00:10:31.422
I open the way, I open the gates.

00:10:32.173 --> 00:10:35.593
[disciples] Here in the darkness.
Here in the darkness.

00:10:35.676 --> 00:10:38.804
I summon you
in the names of the old lords.

00:10:38.888 --> 00:10:44.060
Namtar, Allatu, Morax… Maborym calls you.

00:10:44.143 --> 00:10:46.687
Horvendile calls you.

00:10:47.355 --> 00:10:52.818
We summon you together. Come!

00:10:53.736 --> 00:10:55.112
[disciples gasp]

00:11:02.703 --> 00:11:04.413
[disciples murmuring]

00:11:08.167 --> 00:11:10.169
[tense music playing]

00:11:33.067 --> 00:11:33.901
Alex.

00:11:35.778 --> 00:11:36.737
Alex!

00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:45.704
Get that pouch for me.

00:11:46.872 --> 00:11:47.957
But be careful.

00:11:49.166 --> 00:11:51.335
Don't break the binding circle.

00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:00.344
Hmm. Sand.

00:12:03.597 --> 00:12:05.266
Now the jewel. There.

00:12:06.767 --> 00:12:07.601
Good.

00:12:09.895 --> 00:12:14.650
Well, let's see
what other treasures you have for us.

00:12:17.987 --> 00:12:19.488
-[bird cawing]
-The bird!

00:12:19.572 --> 00:12:21.866
[grunting]

00:12:21.949 --> 00:12:25.286
-Father!
-[Roderick] No! No! Stop.

00:12:37.089 --> 00:12:37.923
Move.

00:12:44.763 --> 00:12:45.973
[grunts]

00:12:49.810 --> 00:12:50.728
[grunts]

00:12:52.271 --> 00:12:53.105
Hmm.

00:12:55.733 --> 00:12:57.776
We'll let our guest recover

00:12:58.360 --> 00:13:00.362
before we tell him our demands.

00:13:03.073 --> 00:13:04.492
Guards, watch him.

00:13:09.371 --> 00:13:10.664
[Dream] I was powerless,

00:13:11.499 --> 00:13:14.376
trapped by a spell cast by an amateur

00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:19.298
with no concern for the damage
he had done to my realm

00:13:20.549 --> 00:13:21.509
and to his own.

00:13:22.843 --> 00:13:25.596
For the following morning,
there were some sleepers…

00:13:25.679 --> 00:13:26.722
[man] Unity.

00:13:27.348 --> 00:13:28.933
[Dream] …who could not wake up.

00:13:29.016 --> 00:13:29.934
Unity.

00:13:33.187 --> 00:13:36.857
Rise and shine, dormouse.
Can't have you late to school, can we?

00:13:38.651 --> 00:13:43.656
Luvvie? Wake up. Unity?

00:13:44.698 --> 00:13:46.992
-What's wrong?
-Call the doctor.

00:13:49.203 --> 00:13:50.037
Hello, operator.

00:13:52.373 --> 00:13:54.416
[people clamoring]

00:14:01.590 --> 00:14:04.718
[Dream] The sleepy sickness,
as it was called,

00:14:04.802 --> 00:14:08.847
affected nearly one million men,
women and children

00:14:08.931 --> 00:14:12.893
in every city, town
and village in the world.

00:14:13.644 --> 00:14:15.187
[doorbell buzzing]

00:14:16.939 --> 00:14:19.066
Sykes! Alex!

00:14:22.611 --> 00:14:23.696
[door opens]

00:14:26.073 --> 00:14:27.074
Oi!

00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:29.660
[Corinthian] Good morning, Magus.

00:14:42.631 --> 00:14:43.799
Do I know you?

00:14:43.883 --> 00:14:48.679
No, but I know all about you, Roderick,

00:14:49.346 --> 00:14:52.766
and the being
you've trapped in your cellar.

00:14:54.977 --> 00:14:57.563
Blackmail then, is it? A shakedown?

00:14:58.188 --> 00:15:01.066
Not at all. I'm here to help you.

00:15:01.150 --> 00:15:03.944
You're gonna need
all the help you can get.

00:15:14.788 --> 00:15:18.292
There are benefits
to keeping one of The Endless close.

00:15:21.170 --> 00:15:22.046
The Endless?

00:15:22.588 --> 00:15:25.090
Did you think Death
was the only one in charge?

00:15:25.716 --> 00:15:27.801
The Reaper has family, you know.

00:15:27.885 --> 00:15:30.804
Desire, Destiny, Despair.

00:15:32.431 --> 00:15:33.933
Which one have I got then?

00:15:34.516 --> 00:15:35.392
Dream.

00:15:36.810 --> 00:15:38.979
What's the good
of a god who governs dreams?

00:15:39.063 --> 00:15:40.064
Not a god.

00:15:41.023 --> 00:15:42.775
More than a god.

00:15:43.525 --> 00:15:46.236
And are men not governed by their dreams?

00:15:46.904 --> 00:15:48.280
You've taken his vestments?

00:15:48.781 --> 00:15:50.908
The ruby, the pouch and the helm?

00:15:52.409 --> 00:15:54.995
-They can lend you an aspect of his power.
-[sniffs]

00:15:56.413 --> 00:16:00.626
Extend your lifespan,
allow you to manipulate others.

00:16:01.877 --> 00:16:05.255
But you must ensure that he never escapes.

00:16:05.339 --> 00:16:07.257
The binding circle is intact.

00:16:07.341 --> 00:16:09.343
The circle will not be enough.

00:16:10.386 --> 00:16:13.931
You must construct
a sphere of glass inside the circle

00:16:14.014 --> 00:16:16.892
to contain Dream's physical manifestation.

00:16:19.436 --> 00:16:23.190
No one must be allowed
to fall asleep in his presence, no one,

00:16:23.273 --> 00:16:26.485
or he will escape into your dreams.

00:16:27.319 --> 00:16:29.113
And you don't want that.

00:16:29.989 --> 00:16:31.824
There are Forced March tablets.

00:16:34.118 --> 00:16:36.787
Stimulants used to keep
trench soldiers awake.

00:16:37.746 --> 00:16:40.499
See that your guards
use them at all times.

00:16:43.293 --> 00:16:47.548
Um… Why are you helping me?
What… what is he to you?

00:16:48.090 --> 00:16:50.592
Well, you could say that
he made me what I am today.

00:16:52.011 --> 00:16:54.722
And if he ever gets free,
he could take it all back.

00:16:57.683 --> 00:16:59.018
We're being observed.

00:16:59.101 --> 00:17:00.936
What? There's nobody here.

00:17:05.357 --> 00:17:07.484
[bird cawing]

00:17:07.568 --> 00:17:10.195
[Corinthian] Well,
you'll have to deal with that one.

00:17:10.279 --> 00:17:11.488
Her name is Jessamy.

00:17:12.156 --> 00:17:13.115
She belongs to him.

00:17:14.158 --> 00:17:16.952
Best of luck… to the both of us.

00:17:18.495 --> 00:17:19.580
Will I see you again?

00:17:20.205 --> 00:17:21.665
You should hope not.

00:17:21.749 --> 00:17:23.208
[car engine starts]

00:17:23.292 --> 00:17:25.169
[car door opens, closes]

00:17:35.179 --> 00:17:36.013
[door opens]

00:17:42.895 --> 00:17:43.896
You can go.

00:17:48.358 --> 00:17:49.443
[cell door closes]

00:17:50.861 --> 00:17:51.862
[sighs]

00:17:52.571 --> 00:17:53.655
Are you awake?

00:17:56.241 --> 00:17:57.409
Are you listening?

00:18:09.546 --> 00:18:10.964
I know who you are…

00:18:13.175 --> 00:18:14.593
Dream of The Endless.

00:18:18.472 --> 00:18:22.184
I captured you
according to the laws of magic.

00:18:24.019 --> 00:18:25.646
But it wasn't you I wanted.

00:18:26.438 --> 00:18:30.192
I wanted Death to return my son Randall,

00:18:30.818 --> 00:18:33.362
who died in the Gallipoli Campaign.

00:18:37.991 --> 00:18:41.036
If you give him back to me,
alive and well,

00:18:42.121 --> 00:18:43.288
I'll release you.

00:18:46.458 --> 00:18:49.169
Is that in your power, Lord of Dreams?

00:18:54.049 --> 00:18:55.384
No, I suppose not.

00:19:00.222 --> 00:19:02.558
So, then, what can you give me?

00:19:05.185 --> 00:19:08.480
If I let you go,
if I promise to give you back your things.

00:19:08.564 --> 00:19:12.442
What, power? Wealth? Immortality? Hmm?

00:19:16.029 --> 00:19:17.739
Is there nothing you can offer me?

00:19:24.705 --> 00:19:26.165
Well, have it your way then.

00:19:27.624 --> 00:19:29.459
And until you're ready to speak,

00:19:31.545 --> 00:19:34.006
I'll enjoy the gifts
you've already given me.

00:19:54.568 --> 00:19:58.655
[Dream] Day after day,
he pleaded for gifts

00:19:58.739 --> 00:20:03.118
that are not mankind's
to receive nor mine to give.

00:20:04.244 --> 00:20:06.038
So I remained silent.

00:20:07.414 --> 00:20:09.124
And ten years later…

00:20:09.208 --> 00:20:10.751
-Enjoy yourself.
-Of course.

00:20:10.834 --> 00:20:13.462
…though my presence there
remained a secret,

00:20:14.004 --> 00:20:18.675
my ruby, sand
and helm brought youth and prosperity

00:20:18.759 --> 00:20:21.261
to Roderick Burgess and his followers.

00:20:21.345 --> 00:20:22.429
[Sykes] Enjoy yourselves.

00:20:23.180 --> 00:20:24.932
But for the rest of the world,

00:20:25.807 --> 00:20:28.101
the suffering continued.

00:20:29.061 --> 00:20:30.187
[Sykes] Alex.

00:20:30.270 --> 00:20:31.521
[jaunty music playing]

00:20:33.357 --> 00:20:34.274
[sighs]

00:20:34.358 --> 00:20:36.526
You're supposed to be working,
not reading.

00:20:37.819 --> 00:20:39.488
Don't let your father catch you.

00:20:47.663 --> 00:20:49.665
[indistinct chatter]

00:20:58.799 --> 00:20:59.758
Good evening.

00:21:02.803 --> 00:21:06.473
Excuse me, I'm afraid that there's
no more room inside this evening.

00:21:06.556 --> 00:21:10.143
-But if you'd all come back tomorrow--
-Been out here for hours. We're not goin'.

00:21:10.227 --> 00:21:12.729
But, I'm afraid that the Magus insists.

00:21:12.813 --> 00:21:14.940
Oh, the Magus insists, does he?

00:21:15.023 --> 00:21:18.360
And who are you to speak for the Magus?
Who the fuck are you?

00:21:18.443 --> 00:21:20.028
[woman] He's the Magus' son.

00:21:20.612 --> 00:21:22.447
[chuckling] You fucking twat.

00:21:23.532 --> 00:21:25.951
And he can do magic too.

00:21:28.078 --> 00:21:28.954
Can't you?

00:21:30.497 --> 00:21:34.501
Do you want him to put a curse on you?
Hex you and all your unborn children?

00:21:34.584 --> 00:21:37.838
No? Then you should leave right now.

00:21:39.339 --> 00:21:42.968
-Can we still come back tomorrow?
-Can they?

00:21:44.886 --> 00:21:48.015
Yeah. If they bring cash.

00:21:48.098 --> 00:21:50.851
Well, you heard him. Cash only.

00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:52.561
Now, piss off.

00:21:53.061 --> 00:21:54.563
[people murmuring]

00:21:57.482 --> 00:21:58.567
Thanks for that.

00:21:59.109 --> 00:22:00.360
You didn't need my help.

00:22:01.737 --> 00:22:04.072
I'll bet you can do magic, can't you?

00:22:05.198 --> 00:22:07.326
Can't do much of anything, really.

00:22:08.327 --> 00:22:09.453
That's not true.

00:22:10.746 --> 00:22:12.497
You're more powerful than you know.

00:22:14.207 --> 00:22:16.126
You can get me in to see the Magus.

00:22:20.964 --> 00:22:22.257
[Alex chuckles softly]

00:22:32.976 --> 00:22:34.519
[door opens]

00:22:35.103 --> 00:22:38.440
[man 1] I'm not staying with that thing
one second longer than I have to.

00:22:38.523 --> 00:22:40.317
[man 2] We can't just leave him alone.

00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:42.694
[man 1] Why not?
He's in his cage, isn't he?

00:22:42.778 --> 00:22:44.946
[man 2 sighs] Sometimes
I wonder about this job.

00:22:45.030 --> 00:22:47.115
[man 1] Really, "sometimes"?

00:22:47.199 --> 00:22:49.034
-I do not have the--
-[Alex] Morning.

00:22:49.701 --> 00:22:51.620
-You seen Noel and Maurice?
-No.

00:22:52.454 --> 00:22:54.081
They're nearly half hour late.

00:22:55.999 --> 00:22:59.419
Uh, I could… watch him,

00:23:00.587 --> 00:23:02.672
until they get here, if you wanted to go.

00:23:07.094 --> 00:23:08.720
-See you tomorrow.
-Cheers, Alex.

00:23:14.267 --> 00:23:18.647
[door opens and closes]

00:23:20.315 --> 00:23:22.317
[eerie music playing]

00:23:45.882 --> 00:23:46.800
Hello.

00:23:55.433 --> 00:23:59.479
It's Alex. The Magus' son.

00:24:04.025 --> 00:24:07.779
See, I don't know
whether you can speak or…

00:24:08.905 --> 00:24:11.074
or even understand me, but

00:24:13.034 --> 00:24:14.619
I just wanted to ask…

00:24:19.624 --> 00:24:21.001
Are you all right in there?

00:24:28.425 --> 00:24:29.426
[scoffs]

00:24:30.010 --> 00:24:32.345
No, of course you're not.

00:24:36.641 --> 00:24:39.436
I'm… I'm sorry about all of this.

00:24:41.062 --> 00:24:43.857
He's not a bad man,
my father, he… he just…

00:24:48.028 --> 00:24:51.698
See, if you could bring Randall back,

00:24:52.574 --> 00:24:55.660
or… or just give him something, anything.

00:24:56.411 --> 00:24:58.288
Or even just speak to him.

00:24:58.371 --> 00:25:00.665
Then I am sure he would let you out.

00:25:05.045 --> 00:25:08.256
See, I… I would let you out

00:25:10.133 --> 00:25:11.343
if I could.

00:25:15.847 --> 00:25:17.474
[Roderick] You would, would you?

00:25:20.477 --> 00:25:21.937
[both grunt]

00:25:22.020 --> 00:25:24.689
-What were you doing down there, huh?
-Nothing.

00:25:24.773 --> 00:25:27.901
You were plotting his escape, weren't you?
Conspiring against me?

00:25:27.984 --> 00:25:28.944
-Hmm?
-No, Father.

00:25:29.027 --> 00:25:31.655
-What did he say to you?
-He didn't say anything.

00:25:32.364 --> 00:25:34.074
Know what would happen if you let him out?

00:25:34.157 --> 00:25:35.867
I won't, Magus. I promise.

00:25:35.951 --> 00:25:37.035
He'd slaughter you.

00:25:37.118 --> 00:25:39.704
He'd slaughter all of us.
Is that what you want?

00:25:40.372 --> 00:25:42.749
Is it? Do you wanna die, Alex? Do you?

00:25:42.832 --> 00:25:45.335
'Cause if you do, it's relatively simple.

00:25:45.418 --> 00:25:46.378
[tapping]

00:25:47.212 --> 00:25:48.171
Fuck.

00:25:48.755 --> 00:25:50.048
[Roderick groans softly]

00:25:50.131 --> 00:25:50.966
[Ethel] Roddy?

00:25:52.968 --> 00:25:54.386
What is it? What's wrong?

00:25:56.012 --> 00:25:57.055
It's Jessamy.

00:25:57.639 --> 00:25:58.890
Who's Jessamy?

00:25:58.974 --> 00:26:01.977
I've been trying to shoot
this wretched bird for ten years now.

00:26:03.561 --> 00:26:05.689
It can't be the same bird, can it?

00:26:10.318 --> 00:26:13.947
-Did he tell you to say that? Did he? Hmm?
-No, Father. He didn't say anything.

00:26:16.116 --> 00:26:17.284
Prove it to me.

00:26:17.784 --> 00:26:19.369
Shoot the fucking bird.

00:26:24.374 --> 00:26:25.292
Ethel.

00:26:26.710 --> 00:26:29.337
[tense music playing]

00:26:45.979 --> 00:26:47.981
[dramatic music playing]

00:28:21.616 --> 00:28:22.700
Fucking hell.

00:28:23.201 --> 00:28:26.621
-Shall we call the fire brigade?
-We are the fire brigade. Come on.

00:28:29.416 --> 00:28:31.543
[dramatic music continues playing]

00:29:06.661 --> 00:29:07.662
[gunshot]

00:29:30.643 --> 00:29:34.314
Idiot. You could have shattered the glass.

00:29:39.861 --> 00:29:40.945
Clear that mess up.

00:30:24.197 --> 00:30:27.200
[Dream] The savagery
of my captors bespoke a world

00:30:27.283 --> 00:30:31.913
whose dreams in my absence
turned darker still.

00:30:32.789 --> 00:30:35.375
A world which would soon be at war again.

00:30:36.543 --> 00:30:40.672
A world still ravaged by the disease
which doctors named…

00:30:41.339 --> 00:30:43.716
encephalitis lethargica.

00:30:44.300 --> 00:30:47.136
I just want to sleep, please.

00:30:47.220 --> 00:30:49.973
[Dream] Some begged for sleep
that would not come.

00:30:51.015 --> 00:30:53.560
Others lived as perpetual sleepwalkers.

00:30:54.519 --> 00:30:57.981
Most slept without waking.

00:30:59.899 --> 00:31:00.900
[Alex grunts]

00:31:01.484 --> 00:31:02.318
[Paul] Sorry, sir.

00:31:03.653 --> 00:31:04.821
What's that you're reading?

00:31:04.904 --> 00:31:05.864
Uh…

00:31:05.947 --> 00:31:09.242
I'm afraid I'm doing much more sleeping
than I am reading at the moment.

00:31:12.871 --> 00:31:14.372
Have you read Vile Bodies?

00:31:15.290 --> 00:31:16.875
Now that'll keep you awake.

00:31:18.710 --> 00:31:20.128
[glass shattering]

00:31:24.674 --> 00:31:26.301
[Ethel crying]

00:31:35.518 --> 00:31:36.561
[door closes]

00:31:42.567 --> 00:31:43.443
You all right?

00:31:46.905 --> 00:31:49.032
Well, I'm going to have a baby. [chuckles]

00:31:49.824 --> 00:31:50.950
[chuckles softly]

00:31:51.826 --> 00:31:53.077
That's wonderful news.

00:31:56.414 --> 00:31:57.248
[sniffles]

00:31:58.374 --> 00:31:59.959
He wants me to get rid of it.

00:32:02.003 --> 00:32:05.965
In fact, he's…
calling the doctor right now.

00:32:15.683 --> 00:32:16.684
[sniffles]

00:32:17.435 --> 00:32:18.394
[clears throat]

00:32:22.607 --> 00:32:23.524
I'll be fine.

00:32:30.782 --> 00:32:31.783
Not your worry.

00:32:57.767 --> 00:32:59.602
[Roderick] What is it? What's wrong?

00:33:01.270 --> 00:33:02.438
She's taken it all.

00:33:03.940 --> 00:33:06.526
The helmet, the pouch,
the ruby, the grimoire,

00:33:07.276 --> 00:33:08.861
and 200,000 in cash.

00:33:10.154 --> 00:33:11.990
She's taken far more than that.

00:33:12.907 --> 00:33:15.660
Find her. Bring her back here now.

00:33:15.743 --> 00:33:16.619
Where are you going?

00:33:16.703 --> 00:33:19.831
To see how badly Dream of The Endless
wants out of his cage.

00:33:23.626 --> 00:33:25.920
The woman who lives with me has gone

00:33:27.088 --> 00:33:29.424
and robbed me of my fortune.

00:33:31.092 --> 00:33:32.427
She's also robbed you.

00:33:34.178 --> 00:33:39.434
She's taken your helm,
your sand and your ruby.

00:33:41.644 --> 00:33:44.147
Now, I can unlock this,
you can go after her…

00:33:47.025 --> 00:33:49.986
if you give me what I've been asking for.

00:33:51.696 --> 00:33:55.450
Wealth, youth, immortality.

00:33:57.618 --> 00:34:00.204
Oh, you're a god.
These things are nothing to you.

00:34:01.998 --> 00:34:05.001
Don't you want your weapons
and your freedom?

00:34:08.546 --> 00:34:12.884
Speak to me! Speak to me! Speak to me!

00:34:12.967 --> 00:34:15.470
-Come on! Speak to me!
-It's all right, Father.

00:34:15.553 --> 00:34:16.679
Get away from me.

00:34:17.597 --> 00:34:19.307
If you were any kind of son to me…

00:34:19.390 --> 00:34:20.308
[Alex grunts]

00:34:23.102 --> 00:34:25.021
If Randall were alive today--

00:34:25.104 --> 00:34:27.690
If Randall were alive,
he would hate you as much as I do.

00:34:31.360 --> 00:34:32.195
[groans]

00:34:35.448 --> 00:34:36.282
[Maurice] Sir?

00:34:44.415 --> 00:34:46.000
You're never getting out of there.

00:34:49.128 --> 00:34:50.129
Never.

00:35:00.973 --> 00:35:02.266
Sir, can you hear me?

00:35:05.311 --> 00:35:06.145
Sir?

00:35:06.854 --> 00:35:09.649
He's not moving. Is he…

00:35:12.235 --> 00:35:13.111
[Noel] He's dead.

00:35:20.910 --> 00:35:22.912
[suspenseful music playing]

00:36:02.076 --> 00:36:03.161
[Maurice] Don't do it, sir.

00:36:03.995 --> 00:36:04.996
He'll kill us.

00:36:07.957 --> 00:36:09.375
What would your father say?

00:36:19.385 --> 00:36:20.386
I need to think.

00:36:37.153 --> 00:36:38.070
Sir?

00:36:40.656 --> 00:36:41.908
Are you all right?

00:36:43.576 --> 00:36:44.744
My father, he, uh…

00:36:48.039 --> 00:36:49.207
He's dead.

00:36:51.751 --> 00:36:53.252
I'm so sorry, sir.

00:37:03.554 --> 00:37:04.639
I'm so sorry, Alex.

00:37:15.775 --> 00:37:19.070
[Dream] Out of loss, new love was born,

00:37:20.321 --> 00:37:21.781
as was new life.

00:37:22.531 --> 00:37:27.078
For nine months later,
Ethel Cripps gave birth to a son.

00:37:27.578 --> 00:37:30.081
My mum used to say that if I was good,

00:37:31.707 --> 00:37:33.751
when I went to sleep, a man would come,

00:37:34.335 --> 00:37:35.962
sprinkle sand in my eyes.

00:37:40.216 --> 00:37:43.010
Make all of my dreams come true.

00:37:45.304 --> 00:37:47.098
But the Sandman's not coming.

00:37:48.057 --> 00:37:49.725
From now on, Johnny,

00:37:51.519 --> 00:37:54.522
you and I are going to have to
make our own dreams come true.

00:37:56.899 --> 00:38:02.863
And nothing and no one
is going to stand in our way.

00:38:03.406 --> 00:38:05.408
[thunder rumbling]

00:38:11.580 --> 00:38:12.832
[door opens]

00:38:18.004 --> 00:38:19.380
[Alex] How is he today, Rogers?

00:38:19.463 --> 00:38:20.715
Buggered if I know, sir.

00:38:21.424 --> 00:38:23.843
Moved his hand this morning. Right hand.

00:38:32.643 --> 00:38:33.894
Oh, my God.

00:38:37.398 --> 00:38:38.232
Alex?

00:38:42.778 --> 00:38:43.612
Hello.

00:38:45.740 --> 00:38:48.034
This is my friend, Paul.

00:38:50.870 --> 00:38:55.583
Paul, this is our unwilling guest.

00:38:58.085 --> 00:39:00.671
Look, we've been talking, Paul and I,

00:39:01.714 --> 00:39:03.257
and if I let you out,

00:39:05.134 --> 00:39:07.511
will you promise not to harm us?

00:39:12.433 --> 00:39:14.685
If you could just speak to us.

00:39:17.480 --> 00:39:19.398
[Alex] You see, I told you.

00:39:19.482 --> 00:39:21.567
I'm telling you, you have to keep trying.

00:39:23.069 --> 00:39:24.653
Show him that he can trust you.

00:39:26.113 --> 00:39:27.448
Show him that you mean it.

00:39:30.951 --> 00:39:32.828
I do mean it.

00:39:35.247 --> 00:39:39.251
Just promise that
you won't harm me or Paul,

00:39:40.378 --> 00:39:42.254
and I will let you out.

00:39:44.548 --> 00:39:46.759
[Dream] Should I have
believed him this time?

00:39:48.719 --> 00:39:51.639
Should I have forgiven him
for murdering my raven?

00:39:54.308 --> 00:39:55.309
Perhaps.

00:39:56.644 --> 00:39:57.812
But in the end…

00:40:00.481 --> 00:40:01.690
I could not.

00:40:02.733 --> 00:40:04.860
[elderly Alex] I could have
asked you for wealth

00:40:04.944 --> 00:40:07.613
or power, like my father did.

00:40:08.989 --> 00:40:11.909
But all I ever wanted
was to be free of you.

00:40:16.914 --> 00:40:18.958
Surely you want that too.

00:40:22.253 --> 00:40:25.798
Alex, darling, please.

00:40:36.517 --> 00:40:37.893
Take me upstairs, Paul.

00:40:39.645 --> 00:40:41.647
I won't be coming down here again.

00:41:13.637 --> 00:41:14.555
[cell door closes]

00:41:16.015 --> 00:41:18.017
Old Dracula here's not givin' an inch.

00:41:19.685 --> 00:41:23.481
-Why do you call it Dracula?
-'Cause I think it's one of them Draculas.

00:41:24.190 --> 00:41:25.399
What do you think it is?

00:41:26.108 --> 00:41:27.109
I try not to.

00:41:28.694 --> 00:41:30.112
You know what I think about?

00:41:31.363 --> 00:41:32.198
Majorca.

00:41:33.365 --> 00:41:36.619
Four days… and I'll be on a beach.

00:41:37.203 --> 00:41:40.289
-Stinking of suntan lotion.
-[Ernie] Lucky bugger.

00:41:41.165 --> 00:41:43.167
I was on Corfu on holiday once.

00:41:43.250 --> 00:41:47.004
I met this right fit type
at the hotel in the morning…

00:41:51.675 --> 00:41:54.053
[indistinct chatter]

00:42:06.649 --> 00:42:08.651
[dramatic music playing]

00:42:45.604 --> 00:42:46.438
[Ernie] Fred!

00:42:48.941 --> 00:42:50.359
Fred, stop it! You'll… Fred!

00:42:54.488 --> 00:42:56.657
Don't move! Stay where you are!

00:42:56.740 --> 00:42:59.076
[Ernie] What… what's he got in his hands?

00:42:59.660 --> 00:43:01.954
Oi! Open your hands, now!

00:43:30.482 --> 00:43:31.483
Paul?

00:43:48.375 --> 00:43:49.835
-Well, hello.
-[meows]

00:43:49.918 --> 00:43:51.128
Where did you come from?

00:44:07.853 --> 00:44:08.771
[Dream] Hello.

00:44:09.897 --> 00:44:11.690
It's… it's you.

00:44:12.941 --> 00:44:15.361
You're… you're free.

00:44:16.153 --> 00:44:17.071
[Dream] I am.

00:44:22.660 --> 00:44:24.745
And you have any idea what it was like?

00:44:25.454 --> 00:44:28.540
Confined in a cage for over a century?

00:44:30.209 --> 00:44:34.129
Do you understand the damage
you've done to your world?

00:44:34.213 --> 00:44:39.051
I'm sorry. I… I didn't know. Please.

00:44:39.134 --> 00:44:42.096
Your punishment, then, shall be a gift.

00:44:43.180 --> 00:44:44.264
I give you this,

00:44:45.307 --> 00:44:50.896
the gift… of eternal… sleep.

00:44:56.652 --> 00:45:00.489
-Alex. Alex, wake up, please.
-[shuddering]

00:45:01.073 --> 00:45:03.951
[Dream] More than a century
of tortured sleep,

00:45:04.034 --> 00:45:06.954
of Dreams and Nightmares running riot

00:45:08.539 --> 00:45:10.040
was coming to an end.

00:45:10.124 --> 00:45:11.291
[Corinthian] He's free.

00:45:14.795 --> 00:45:16.630
He's out of his cage.

00:45:24.930 --> 00:45:25.806
[clears throat]

00:45:28.058 --> 00:45:31.478
So, I'm afraid I'm gonna have to run.

00:45:33.730 --> 00:45:39.361
And I'm not gonna stop
until I've reshaped this world

00:45:41.196 --> 00:45:43.699
to look just like me.

00:46:03.427 --> 00:46:06.763
[Lucienne] Sir. Sir!

00:46:08.223 --> 00:46:10.267
Oh, my goodness.

00:46:10.893 --> 00:46:11.852
Sir.

00:46:12.811 --> 00:46:13.979
It's me.

00:46:16.648 --> 00:46:17.983
It's Lucienne.

00:46:20.110 --> 00:46:20.944
[Dream gasps]

00:46:21.820 --> 00:46:23.530
[weakly] Lucienne.

00:46:24.490 --> 00:46:27.159
You're home, my Lord.

00:46:27.784 --> 00:46:29.036
I am.

00:46:29.953 --> 00:46:31.955
[enthralling music playing]

00:47:03.445 --> 00:47:05.531
[rumbling]

00:47:11.411 --> 00:47:15.999
Forgive me, sir, but… the realm,

00:47:17.459 --> 00:47:18.669
the palace…

00:47:20.921 --> 00:47:22.923
they are not as you left them.

00:47:45.487 --> 00:47:47.114
What happened here?

00:47:48.407 --> 00:47:49.449
Who did this?

00:47:52.244 --> 00:47:54.913
[Lucienne] My Lord, you are The Dreaming,

00:47:55.622 --> 00:47:57.374
The Dreaming is you.

00:47:58.125 --> 00:48:00.502
With you gone as long as you were,

00:48:00.586 --> 00:48:03.714
the realm began to… decay

00:48:04.798 --> 00:48:05.882
and crumble.

00:48:08.010 --> 00:48:09.177
And the residents?

00:48:11.013 --> 00:48:12.389
The palace staff?

00:48:13.599 --> 00:48:15.642
I'm afraid most have

00:48:17.269 --> 00:48:18.186
gone.

00:48:18.770 --> 00:48:21.481
-Gone?
-Some went looking for you.

00:48:23.108 --> 00:48:24.234
And the others?

00:48:26.862 --> 00:48:31.533
They thought, perhaps,
you'd grown weary of your duties

00:48:33.201 --> 00:48:34.703
-and--
-What?

00:48:37.164 --> 00:48:38.373
Abandoned them?

00:48:40.375 --> 00:48:42.210
Had they so little faith in me?

00:48:44.046 --> 00:48:46.006
Do my own subjects not know me?

00:48:46.673 --> 00:48:48.300
If I may, sir.

00:48:49.092 --> 00:48:51.511
It wouldn't be the first time
one of The Endless had just--

00:48:51.595 --> 00:48:52.512
Enough.

00:48:54.181 --> 00:48:57.809
I will not have Dreams and Nightmares
preying on the waking world.

00:48:57.893 --> 00:48:59.478
I will bring them all back.

00:49:04.775 --> 00:49:06.943
I made this realm once, Lucienne.

00:49:10.155 --> 00:49:11.657
I will make it again.

00:49:33.136 --> 00:49:34.471
I knew you would return.

00:49:34.554 --> 00:49:35.931
The Dreaming must be restored.

00:49:37.265 --> 00:49:39.309
You want me to kill the King of Dreams?

00:49:39.393 --> 00:49:41.561
[Corinthian] You just have to trust me.

00:49:41.645 --> 00:49:44.314
[woman 1] Whatever's happening,
however it's happening,

00:49:44.398 --> 00:49:45.816
your dreams are coming true.

00:49:46.858 --> 00:49:48.819
[woman 2] I'm worried about my brother.

00:49:48.902 --> 00:49:51.905
I need your help. If dreams disappear,
then so will humanity.

00:49:51.988 --> 00:49:53.156
You have to do something.

00:49:53.824 --> 00:49:55.784
[Matthew the raven] Fuck it!
Let's go to Hell.

00:49:57.869 --> 00:50:00.956
What power have Dreams in Hell?

00:50:01.707 --> 00:50:04.835
Nightmares do not belong
in the waking world, Corinthian.

00:50:04.918 --> 00:50:06.211
Oh, turns out I fit right in.

00:50:07.546 --> 00:50:10.632
Can I get you anything you desire?

00:50:12.092 --> 00:50:15.762
Your kingdom is my birthright.

00:50:15.846 --> 00:50:18.348
Can you imagine the damage he could do?

00:50:18.432 --> 00:50:19.641
[Dream screaming]

00:50:19.725 --> 00:50:22.144
You don't think Dreams can die.
Let's find out.

00:50:23.103 --> 00:50:25.063
-Boss!
-Still with us, Dream?

00:50:25.147 --> 00:50:27.315
[Matthew the raven]
Dreams don't fucking die.

00:50:29.443 --> 00:50:31.445
[theme music playing]
