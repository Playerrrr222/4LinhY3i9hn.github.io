00:59.727 --> 01:00.967
No, no, wait.

01:01.062 --> 01:03.353
[shouts]

01:05.900 --> 01:08.458
-Hey, cut.
-[alarm sounds]

01:08.477 --> 01:09.717
Cut.

01:09.737 --> 01:11.295
Hey, what's going on?

01:11.313 --> 01:12.404
Cut!

01:14.057 --> 01:15.908
You guys talking upstairs?

01:16.059 --> 01:17.076
[coughing]

01:20.306 --> 01:21.747
-Okay?
-I'm okay.

01:25.978 --> 01:27.252
[coughing continues]

01:36.931 --> 01:38.746
Hello?

01:38.766 --> 01:41.158
<i> -Alicia?</i>
-Speaking. Who's this?

01:41.251 --> 01:44.328
<i> Alicia, Hi,</i>
<i> this is Sharon Warman.</i>

01:44.346 --> 01:47.347
Mrs. Warman?
I'm sorry, I didn't realize.

01:47.441 --> 01:48.832
What can I do for you?

01:48.925 --> 01:50.943
<i> Listen,</i>
<i> this is kind of last minute</i>

01:51.094 --> 01:54.429
<i> but Peggy's father, I think</i>
<i>he's had a stroke or something.</i>

01:54.523 --> 01:58.024
<i> Anyway, she's had to fly back</i>
<i> home, so opportunity knocks.</i>

01:58.119 --> 02:00.452
Okay. How can I help?

02:00.679 --> 02:03.789
<i> Well, we kept this hush</i>
<i> hush in the agency but</i>

02:04.016 --> 02:06.016
<i> a high profile</i>
<i> client needs an assistant,</i>

02:06.034 --> 02:08.685
<i> someone with discretion</i>
<i> and zeal.</i>

02:08.704 --> 02:11.188
<i> Peggy says you're it.</i>

02:11.281 --> 02:13.799
That's kind of her.
Who is it?

02:14.026 --> 02:15.134
<i> It's Desmond Gage.</i>

02:15.285 --> 02:17.452
Desmond Gage?

02:17.546 --> 02:20.288
<i> Yes, but he's in Green Valley</i>
<i> and we need you here today.</i>

02:20.382 --> 02:22.474
Green Valley?
Where's that?

02:22.626 --> 02:25.369
<i> Close to Arrowhead,</i>
<i> the middle of nowhere.</i>

02:25.462 --> 02:26.812
<i> Let me get you the address.</i>

03:04.076 --> 03:06.185
[bell dings]

03:24.872 --> 03:26.538
[clock ticks]

03:43.465 --> 03:45.140
-Alicia?
-Miss Warman?

03:46.952 --> 03:48.802
-Hi.
-Hi.

03:48.954 --> 03:50.395
You made it.

03:50.622 --> 03:52.064
Yes, thank you
so much for this opportunity.

03:52.291 --> 03:55.234
Oh, don't thank me.
Thank yourself.

03:55.385 --> 03:57.552
You made quite the impression
on Peggy.

03:57.571 --> 04:00.405
Hollywood 101: build bridges.

04:00.557 --> 04:02.532
-Yeah.
-Come this way.

04:07.656 --> 04:10.991
Well, there he is in the flesh.

04:11.143 --> 04:12.417
Wow.

04:12.644 --> 04:13.660
I'm sure you've
heard the rumors.

04:13.754 --> 04:16.162
Are they true?

04:16.257 --> 04:19.149
Desmond is very private
and he doesn't like labels.

04:19.167 --> 04:21.093
But if he likes you,
he'll let you in.

04:21.320 --> 04:23.837
Oh, okay.

04:23.989 --> 04:26.598
Let me pull this out and
I will show you your room.

04:33.590 --> 04:36.275
Oh, um, does that
thing even work?

04:36.426 --> 04:38.351
Oh, yes. It worked so well

04:38.504 --> 04:40.028
that it drives
him off his rails.

04:52.126 --> 04:54.534
This cabin is so cute.

04:54.628 --> 04:56.295
Your bathroom is here.

04:56.522 --> 04:57.871
Oh, okay.

04:57.965 --> 04:59.256
I get my own bathroom?

05:04.454 --> 05:06.120
Wow, nice.

05:06.214 --> 05:08.214
Okay. You need to
hide this somewhere.

05:08.367 --> 05:10.367
Obviously, use it if there
is an emergency.

05:10.385 --> 05:12.811
But if Desmond hears this
ring, he will go ballistic.

05:12.962 --> 05:14.704
Oh wow, okay.

05:14.723 --> 05:16.964
Is the signal
really that bad here?

05:16.984 --> 05:18.391
Well, just go ten
miles in either direction,

05:18.485 --> 05:20.377
and you'll be golden.

05:20.470 --> 05:21.987
-Um...
-Would that be a problem?

05:22.138 --> 05:23.780
No, no.
Totally fine.

05:25.659 --> 05:26.974
Where can I put this?

05:27.069 --> 05:31.145
-Is under here, okay?
-Sure.

05:31.239 --> 05:33.740
And where is Desmond's room?

05:33.834 --> 05:34.741
Downstairs in the living room.

05:34.893 --> 05:36.168
You walked right past it.

05:36.395 --> 05:37.669
I actually have
to get back to the city, but...

05:37.896 --> 05:39.320
Oh.

05:39.340 --> 05:42.065
This is the movie's
press release,

05:42.084 --> 05:43.917
as well as a copy of
Inside Hollywood.

05:44.069 --> 05:45.902
I don't know
if Desmond wants to see it.

05:45.995 --> 05:47.420
It's been hard
to figure out these days.

05:47.514 --> 05:48.680
Should I be concerned?

05:50.184 --> 05:52.592
No. An actor is an actor
is an actor.

05:52.744 --> 05:55.595
Just keep him company,
and clean up after him and

05:55.747 --> 05:56.763
two of these a day.

05:56.857 --> 05:58.357
Oh, two a day. Got it.

05:58.584 --> 06:00.359
They're for his stomach.
He always forgets.

06:00.586 --> 06:02.419
I don't know.
He's sampling something new.

06:02.512 --> 06:04.437
Oh, and don't
let the cat starve.

06:04.590 --> 06:05.530
Think I can do that.

06:05.682 --> 06:07.532
-Follow me out.
-Okay.

06:12.097 --> 06:14.873
Well, welcome
to the big leagues, kiddo.

06:15.100 --> 06:16.116
Thanks.

06:16.268 --> 06:19.102
Could you introduce us?

06:19.195 --> 06:21.438
Oh, he's actually
focused right now,

06:21.456 --> 06:23.957
but I told him about you.

06:24.109 --> 06:25.959
Oh. Okay.

06:26.053 --> 06:27.010
Thank you.

06:28.797 --> 06:30.347
Bye.

07:07.986 --> 07:10.262
Aww...

07:10.489 --> 07:11.555
Hey, buddy.

07:15.436 --> 07:17.844
Do you want some food?

07:17.996 --> 07:20.163
Come here.
Come on.

07:20.182 --> 07:22.190
Yeah, that's what you want.

07:23.351 --> 07:24.860
Okay. Here we go.

07:26.855 --> 07:29.865
There you go.
There.

07:33.620 --> 07:35.345
Oh, I'm sorry.

07:35.438 --> 07:37.605
I'm sorry,
I was just feeding the cat.

07:37.624 --> 07:38.865
Oh, it's fine.

07:39.017 --> 07:40.016
You must be one of Sharon's.

07:40.109 --> 07:42.794
Yes, Melissa,
I mean, Alicia.

07:42.946 --> 07:44.296
Did you just get
your own name wrong?

07:44.523 --> 07:46.465
What I meant was my
friends call me Lacy,

07:46.692 --> 07:47.857
and I know
we're not friends yet,

07:47.951 --> 07:50.376
but if you wanted to
call me...

07:50.471 --> 07:51.711
Lacy.

07:51.805 --> 07:53.138
Thank you so much, Lacy.

07:53.365 --> 07:54.714
I know this was
very last minute.

07:54.808 --> 07:57.367
Yes, but super happy to be here.

07:57.460 --> 07:58.535
Come here.

07:58.553 --> 08:00.228
Oh, uh...

08:02.040 --> 08:04.316
I promise I will
give you everything I got.

08:06.153 --> 08:08.487
Okay, I see you met Sylvester,
that's good.

08:08.714 --> 08:09.637
Thanks for feeding
the old devil.

08:09.731 --> 08:10.730
-Oh yeah.
-You hungry?

08:10.824 --> 08:11.973
No, I'm fine.

08:11.992 --> 08:14.067
Let me get you something to eat.

08:14.219 --> 08:15.494
Let me just get the door.

08:18.573 --> 08:21.148
Can I help you with
anything?

08:21.168 --> 08:22.726
Yeah, you can help me with this
thing, I'm burning up.

08:22.744 --> 08:24.002
Oh, okay.

08:26.507 --> 08:28.155
Oh good.

08:28.175 --> 08:29.657
Oh, do you mind?

08:29.751 --> 08:31.468
-It's so dark in.
-Oh yeah.

08:33.997 --> 08:35.096
Beautiful.

08:37.351 --> 08:41.911
All this stuff
is organic.

08:41.930 --> 08:43.855
Sharon buys it at
the farmers market,

08:44.082 --> 08:45.840
I think it's just down
the street. Delicious.

08:45.859 --> 08:47.433
Can I get anything else for you?

08:47.586 --> 08:49.586
Just... yeah, tell you what.

08:49.679 --> 08:51.112
-Why don't you get a carrot?
-Oh, okay.

08:58.597 --> 08:59.454
There we go.

09:01.616 --> 09:03.024
-Yeah, one more, okay.
-Here you go.

09:03.043 --> 09:05.451
Great. You like carrots?

09:05.546 --> 09:07.028
-Yeah.
-Good.

09:07.047 --> 09:09.363
Mmm. Mm.

09:09.383 --> 09:10.456
Yeah.

09:10.609 --> 09:12.366
What are you making?

09:12.460 --> 09:14.702
Smoothies.
Everything the body needs.

09:14.796 --> 09:16.446
I drink two of these a day.

09:16.464 --> 09:18.014
-Are you a vegetarian?
-[blender roars]

09:24.790 --> 09:25.814
There we go.

09:31.813 --> 09:33.721
-Voila.
-Oh, thank you.

09:33.740 --> 09:34.906
That's dinner.

09:35.133 --> 09:36.741
Oh.

09:36.968 --> 09:37.993
Mmm.

09:40.138 --> 09:41.487
Mm.

09:41.640 --> 09:43.990
Wow.

09:44.142 --> 09:47.310
So, what's Sharon
like as a boss?

09:47.329 --> 09:51.664
Oh, just great.
Tough, but... thorough.

09:51.817 --> 09:53.499
You must know her
assistant, Peggy.

09:53.652 --> 09:57.429
Yes. Technically,
I'm actually her assistant.

09:57.656 --> 10:00.081
Look at Sharon. You're the
assistant's assistant?

10:00.175 --> 10:01.991
Well, I mean, it's not bad.

10:02.010 --> 10:05.011
I mean, a few months ago, I was
driving tractors in Arizona.

10:05.105 --> 10:06.012
-So...
-Arizona?

10:06.106 --> 10:08.348
Well, that's a change.

10:08.500 --> 10:10.758
Yeah, I needed one.

10:10.852 --> 10:12.352
What's that mean?

10:12.446 --> 10:15.447
Well, I was just so done
with the farm life,

10:15.598 --> 10:19.266
and last spring we lost
a lot of money and it...

10:19.361 --> 10:22.028
Timing just seemed right.

10:22.180 --> 10:23.437
I do really want
to be like Sharon,

10:23.457 --> 10:24.706
you know, follow
in her footsteps.

10:27.202 --> 10:28.201
Are you going to drink that?

10:28.353 --> 10:30.420
Oh, yeah, of course.

10:34.025 --> 10:34.883
Mmm.

10:37.120 --> 10:38.953
You're a terrible actress.

10:38.972 --> 10:40.713
Sorry.

10:40.807 --> 10:41.956
Don't worry about it.

10:42.050 --> 10:43.808
We're going to work on that.

10:43.960 --> 10:46.536
In this town, everybody's got to
act their asses off to survive.

10:46.629 --> 10:48.313
I know this stuff
tastes like crap.

10:48.464 --> 10:50.649
I only drink it
because of the screen.

10:50.876 --> 10:53.543
Got it.

10:53.561 --> 10:54.986
Speaking of the screen,

10:55.138 --> 10:57.322
do you understand
what we're doing here?

10:57.473 --> 10:58.639
Yeah. Well, I know that
you want to do

10:58.659 --> 11:00.325
some preparation
for your next role.

11:00.552 --> 11:01.976
Preparation's cute.

11:02.070 --> 11:03.569
I prefer immersion.

11:03.664 --> 11:05.479
Immersion?

11:05.573 --> 11:08.315
Yeah, I have to immerse myself
in my character, Lennox.

11:08.335 --> 11:10.910
So Desmond disappears.

11:11.004 --> 11:13.413
See, the audience has to forget
every other role

11:13.507 --> 11:15.064
that I've ever played.

11:15.083 --> 11:16.749
Wow.

11:16.902 --> 11:19.177
Yeah. This is going to be
the role of a lifetime.

11:36.421 --> 11:37.862
[sighs]

11:54.272 --> 11:56.047
I love this picture of mom.

11:56.274 --> 11:57.790
Yeah.

11:57.884 --> 12:00.201
Million dollar smile.

12:00.220 --> 12:02.111
Do you think I have her smile?

12:02.130 --> 12:03.613
Of course you do.

12:03.706 --> 12:04.964
You've got quite a few
of her qualities.

12:05.058 --> 12:08.560
Really? Like what?

12:08.787 --> 12:11.804
Her eyes.
Her skin.

12:11.898 --> 12:14.065
Unfortunately,
you're cursed with my nose.

12:16.962 --> 12:20.296
I'm going to move
to Los Angeles.

12:20.315 --> 12:23.649
Not today,
not tomorrow.

12:23.744 --> 12:26.319
-Not for ten years.
-Five.

12:26.413 --> 12:28.562
Eight.

12:28.582 --> 12:29.914
I made a promise to her.

12:31.993 --> 12:34.085
She loved Arizona
but she missed Cali.

12:36.314 --> 12:37.088
I know.

12:38.592 --> 12:39.507
I love you, coach.

12:41.169 --> 12:43.511
I love you, too.
And your nose.

13:38.301 --> 13:39.275
[chuckles]

13:52.057 --> 13:53.573
[sighs]

13:53.725 --> 13:54.666
Wow.

13:56.895 --> 13:58.127
[sighs]

14:01.824 --> 14:03.324
[knocking]

14:03.343 --> 14:04.467
Lacy?

14:11.593 --> 14:13.017
-Uh, um...
-Shh, it's okay.

14:13.169 --> 14:14.269
It's just me.

14:15.355 --> 14:16.938
Uh, sorry.

14:19.025 --> 14:22.193
Did...
Did you need something?

14:24.105 --> 14:26.923
You said you're
from Arizona, right?

14:26.941 --> 14:29.868
-Yeah?
-Well...

14:30.019 --> 14:33.037
I was thinking about giving my
character an Arizona backstory.

14:34.040 --> 14:35.707
Okay.

14:35.934 --> 14:39.102
So I need to know how
they kiss over there.

14:39.120 --> 14:41.045
[chuckles]
Um... I...

14:41.272 --> 14:44.698
I imagine that it's just
like everywhere else.

14:44.718 --> 14:47.443
Oh, come on,
I'm being serious now.

14:47.536 --> 14:51.130
There's so many
different variations.

14:51.224 --> 14:52.348
Like, intensity...

14:53.618 --> 14:54.893
And wetness.

14:56.062 --> 14:57.020
Passion.

14:58.456 --> 14:59.355
And flavor.

15:00.808 --> 15:01.958
Flavor?

15:01.976 --> 15:03.484
Yeah, you know?

15:05.146 --> 15:07.463
Come on, don't be modest.

15:07.556 --> 15:11.225
I know you just kissed
hundreds of guys.

15:11.244 --> 15:14.746
Actually I... I've just been
so focused on my future,

15:14.973 --> 15:16.414
I really...

15:16.565 --> 15:19.325
You're so funny.

15:19.419 --> 15:20.752
So tell me...

15:22.571 --> 15:23.713
Is this authentic?

15:38.830 --> 15:40.396
[panting]

15:42.108 --> 15:43.441
[chuckles]

15:45.779 --> 15:46.861

16:07.025 --> 16:09.300
[sighs]

16:09.527 --> 16:11.785
No, no, no.

16:11.805 --> 16:14.472
Please, take my health,
but don't take my service.

16:17.143 --> 16:18.977
Ugh, damn it.

16:20.814 --> 16:21.980
Sucks.

16:38.814 --> 16:39.914
[chuckles]

16:41.893 --> 16:43.650
Well, good morning.

16:43.745 --> 16:47.005
Good morning, Sleepyhead.

16:47.232 --> 16:48.489
What are you making?

16:48.583 --> 16:52.084
My favorites, banana flapjacks.

16:52.178 --> 16:54.737
I learned how to make these
from a Brazilian chef

16:54.830 --> 16:57.831
who put his own divine
twist on a French recipe.

16:57.851 --> 17:00.092
That sounds amazing, actually.

17:00.186 --> 17:01.853
You have no idea.

17:02.080 --> 17:04.930
One time in Rio de Janeiro
I ate six of these

17:05.083 --> 17:07.099
-in one sitting.
-Nice.

17:07.252 --> 17:10.586
Oh, that reminds me before
I forget I have your pills here.

17:10.605 --> 17:12.772
So let me just
get two of them for you.

17:12.866 --> 17:15.441
Thank you.

17:15.535 --> 17:16.868
These are a lifesaver.

17:20.598 --> 17:22.540
Hmm.

17:22.767 --> 17:23.875
Mmm.

17:26.195 --> 17:29.196
So, how did it go last night?

17:29.215 --> 17:31.440
Um, good, I think.

17:31.459 --> 17:33.125
You mean, you can't tell?

17:33.219 --> 17:35.202
Not until the dailies.

17:35.221 --> 17:36.804
Like I said,
I'm no longer Desmond.

17:38.783 --> 17:41.467
Can I ask
what's the movie about?

17:41.619 --> 17:43.877
Oh, oh.

17:43.897 --> 17:45.063
You'll have to try this.

17:45.290 --> 17:46.898
Oh, okay.

17:48.234 --> 17:49.883
-Mmm.
-Mm-hmm.

17:49.903 --> 17:51.069
Aren't they lit?

17:52.463 --> 17:54.297
-So good.
-Right?

17:54.390 --> 17:56.482
Oh yeah, I can't believe
you made those, you know.

17:56.576 --> 17:58.651
I feel like
I should be making these you.

17:58.803 --> 17:59.410
You don't want all
of them, though?

17:59.637 --> 18:01.079
No, no, no.

18:01.230 --> 18:01.913
Are you sure?
I don't want to take...

18:02.140 --> 18:03.247
Oh, okay.

18:11.424 --> 18:15.742
So, you know, I do
follow you on social media.

18:15.762 --> 18:18.721
200 Bucks says that I know where
this conversation is going.

18:21.083 --> 18:24.084
You want to know
if the rumors are true.

18:24.178 --> 18:27.997
I mean, if we had service,
I would totally Venmo you.

18:28.090 --> 18:31.183
I just love how you Gen Z brains

18:31.277 --> 18:35.404
get all lit up at the prospect
of any frivolous meme.

18:36.858 --> 18:38.599
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

18:38.693 --> 18:39.784
Is that... is that
really all it was?

18:40.011 --> 18:41.536
Just a meme?

18:47.518 --> 18:48.942
No.

18:48.962 --> 18:51.520
No, not this.

18:51.539 --> 18:53.297
Really?

18:55.969 --> 18:57.710
His name is Philippe.

18:57.804 --> 18:59.378
We met when I was on vacation.

18:59.530 --> 19:01.213
He was a barman
on a cruise ship.

19:01.307 --> 19:03.141
-No way!
-Yeah, way.

19:06.554 --> 19:09.796
I get so tired of hiding.

19:09.816 --> 19:13.133
Hollywood can be so suffocating.

19:13.153 --> 19:14.610
This is crazy.

19:16.547 --> 19:18.322
I'll let you know...

19:18.549 --> 19:19.882
I mean, I...

19:19.975 --> 19:22.142
I grew up watching
you all the time.

19:22.162 --> 19:25.888
And I would have never known.

19:25.907 --> 19:28.499
Well, it's not like
we all wear pink.

19:28.651 --> 19:31.169
Look, it's not something
that you can really tell.

19:31.396 --> 19:34.172
I mean, obviously not.
I couldn't tell.

19:37.402 --> 19:41.420
But... but you were engaged
to that Italian actress, right?

19:41.514 --> 19:44.089
-Mirabella Anatusa?
-Yes.

19:44.184 --> 19:46.333
That was a lifetime ago.

19:46.352 --> 19:50.337
I was very young and
very confused.

19:50.431 --> 19:54.174
But look, it's not like I can't
appreciate the female form.

19:54.194 --> 19:57.253
But truth be told,

19:57.271 --> 19:59.255
Sharon choreographed
every step of that,

19:59.273 --> 20:00.756
all the way to the altar.

20:00.849 --> 20:04.035
-No, she didn't?
-She did. Every detail.

20:05.205 --> 20:06.871
She would always say,

20:07.022 --> 20:10.950
Look, kid, it's the facade
that pays the bills.

20:11.044 --> 20:13.026
And she's right.

20:13.120 --> 20:16.005
I just don't think that my fans
would fall for a gay Romeo.

20:17.717 --> 20:19.550
Well, you never know.

20:19.777 --> 20:21.219
Look, I know
it's a backwards thought.

20:21.446 --> 20:23.221
But back then,
it seemed to make more sense.

20:25.225 --> 20:27.541
Wow. I just
I cannot believe that

20:27.635 --> 20:30.286
she faked an entire wedding.

20:30.304 --> 20:31.971
Oh, believe it.

20:32.123 --> 20:34.065
You'd be smart
to learn from her.

20:34.216 --> 20:36.901
She's very good
at managing my career.

20:38.296 --> 20:39.219
I guess so.

20:39.313 --> 20:40.813
Are you ready? Set?

20:40.907 --> 20:41.888
-What?
-Go.

20:41.908 --> 20:43.908
But...

20:44.059 --> 20:45.534
Hey, wait up.

20:49.749 --> 20:50.748
Desmond?

20:52.418 --> 20:53.751
Desmond!

20:55.922 --> 20:57.046
Where are you?

20:59.150 --> 21:00.258

22:06.567 --> 22:08.809
Lacy, where are you?

22:08.828 --> 22:10.235
Oh, I'm in the mountains
for work.

22:10.388 --> 22:12.571
There's no signal here.

22:12.665 --> 22:14.723
That sounds isolated.

22:14.817 --> 22:16.408
<i> I think that's kind</i>
<i> of the purpose.</i>

22:16.502 --> 22:18.669
Have you got a number
I can contact you on?

22:19.914 --> 22:22.731
I have an unknown here.

22:22.750 --> 22:26.993
It's actually...
it's better if I just call you.

22:27.088 --> 22:28.846
<i> Like you did yesterday?</i>

22:28.997 --> 22:31.331
This is not exactly
a vacation, Dad.

22:31.351 --> 22:33.351
Look, I just want somewhere
to reach you at.

22:33.578 --> 22:37.079
I won't call you.
I won't harass you.

22:37.098 --> 22:38.839
<i> Do you promise?</i>

22:38.858 --> 22:39.857
Promise.

22:51.779 --> 22:53.429
<i> Did your lips fall off?</i>

22:53.447 --> 22:54.930
Oh my gosh.

22:54.949 --> 22:56.707
<i> Who else is up there with you?</i>

22:56.859 --> 22:58.283
Um, okay,
you can't tell anybody,

22:58.378 --> 23:00.953
but it's Desmond Gage.

23:01.047 --> 23:02.529
<i> Desmond who?</i>

23:02.548 --> 23:05.049
Desmond Gage, dad.
He's a huge actor.

23:05.200 --> 23:07.218
Mom loved him.

23:07.369 --> 23:11.130
That's nice, hon.
Who else is there?

23:11.282 --> 23:12.965
<i> Honestly, this is</i>
<i> a huge deal for me, Dad.</i>

23:13.117 --> 23:16.135
It's like the planets
are aligning for me.

23:16.287 --> 23:19.288
I'm happy for you.
But who else is there?

23:19.306 --> 23:21.399
Um... Well, it's
actually just us two.

23:21.550 --> 23:23.383
<i> -But it's great.</i>
-What?

23:23.477 --> 23:25.144
<i> He's so nice, Dad.</i>

23:25.296 --> 23:27.463
You're up there alone with him?

23:27.481 --> 23:29.573
You know how volatile
these Hollywood types are.

23:29.800 --> 23:32.726
Yeah, but he's not like.
He's so nice.

23:32.820 --> 23:34.745
<i> They all act nice.</i>

23:34.897 --> 23:38.824
Look. Why don't you go back to
L.A. or come back home, please?

23:38.918 --> 23:40.918
<i> Are you kidding me?</i>
<i> My boss would kill me.</i>

23:41.069 --> 23:42.235
They'll find someone else.

23:42.329 --> 23:43.737
No, I can't do that.

23:43.756 --> 23:45.589
Like that is
out of the question, okay,

23:45.741 --> 23:48.909
but just... just know that
Desmond is great and I'm good.

23:49.003 --> 23:52.154
And if I do a good job at this,
I will get a huge promotion

23:52.247 --> 23:53.839

<i> send you money</i>

No, she did but I just...
I was going to unplug it,

No, you don't understand!

What if this had gone off

I know, like I said, I
was going to unplug it

25:20.002 --> 25:21.426

I just didn't get there in time

[coughs]

33:31.677 --> 33:32.676
Ugh.
[coughs]

33:51.179 --> 33:52.587
Good morning, miss.

33:52.606 --> 33:55.924
Morning, officer.
Is everything okay?

33:56.017 --> 33:57.367
Certainly, it looks that way.

33:59.204 --> 34:00.871
Excuse me?

34:01.098 --> 34:02.873
Rangers saw
smoke here last night.

34:03.100 --> 34:04.783
They thought this place was
vacant,

34:04.935 --> 34:06.601
so I thought I'd
give it a checkup.

34:06.620 --> 34:09.287
Yeah, we just arrived
from L.A. the other night.

34:09.439 --> 34:12.049
And you come all the way out of
here, why would you do that?

34:12.276 --> 34:14.200
Uh...

34:14.219 --> 34:17.870
75 degree weather in L.A.
isn't amazing enough for you?

34:17.964 --> 34:18.889
Yeah, just for work.

34:19.040 --> 34:21.374
You know, me and a friend.

34:21.468 --> 34:24.452
-Fun times, fun times.
-Yeah.

34:24.471 --> 34:25.878
All right.

34:25.898 --> 34:27.956
Well, you and your friend
stay warm.

34:27.974 --> 34:30.049
-Oh, we'll try.
-Okay, now.

34:30.143 --> 34:31.401
-Okay.
-Good day.

34:31.628 --> 34:32.402
You too.

35:06.105 --> 35:07.604
[coughing]

35:47.537 --> 35:49.295
<i> ...you have dialed</i>
<i> has been disconnected</i>

35:49.314 --> 35:51.273
<i> or is no longer in service.</i>

35:57.564 --> 35:59.781
DESMOND: But yes...

36:01.827 --> 36:03.493
In all honesty...

36:05.998 --> 36:08.498
I just want to get...
Desmond, stop resisting.

36:09.501 --> 36:10.500
Sir...

36:11.670 --> 36:13.336
Desmond.

36:17.901 --> 36:19.009
Oh, ah!

36:19.160 --> 36:20.826
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.

36:20.846 --> 36:22.345
I just was...
I heard voices and I...

36:22.497 --> 36:24.330
I should... I better go.

36:24.424 --> 36:26.666
No, no, it's fine, please.

36:26.685 --> 36:27.517
I'm glad you're here.

36:30.247 --> 36:32.263
Can I show you something?

36:32.416 --> 36:35.583
-Come here, come here.
-Yeah.

36:35.602 --> 36:38.511
I don't want you to get
your expectations too high.

36:38.530 --> 36:42.607
Look, this is really
dumb and silly,

36:42.759 --> 36:44.609
but I know you're bored
out here, as am I.

36:44.703 --> 36:47.370
So...
Okay.

36:54.379 --> 36:56.438
See, I told you it was
pretty damn stupid.

36:56.531 --> 36:57.380
-It's...
-No, no, not at all.

36:57.607 --> 36:59.532
It's stupid.

36:59.551 --> 37:01.125
No, I mean, there's only so much
outdoor stuff you can do.

37:01.278 --> 37:03.035
You're just trying to
protect my feelings.

37:03.055 --> 37:05.463
No, I really actually
love puzzles.

37:05.615 --> 37:07.039
So... Come on, let's do it.

37:07.133 --> 37:09.392
-You sure?
-Yeah.

37:14.474 --> 37:16.066
I haven't done one
of these in years.

37:16.217 --> 37:17.067
I know, me neither.

37:24.243 --> 37:26.058
Can I get you some wine?

37:26.078 --> 37:28.653
Oh, no, I...
I shouldn't drink.

37:28.805 --> 37:29.895
-No.
-Water's great.

37:29.915 --> 37:31.139
No, I must insist.

37:31.232 --> 37:32.415
This calls for a celebration.

37:35.645 --> 37:36.753
Voila!

37:38.590 --> 37:39.923
Nice.

37:43.670 --> 37:47.430
I've been saving this
for a special occasion.

37:52.178 --> 37:53.770
Thank you.

37:56.666 --> 37:58.090
So what should we toast to?

37:58.110 --> 38:00.685
Um...

38:00.779 --> 38:01.945
To new things.

38:03.523 --> 38:05.240
Yeah, to new things.

38:12.958 --> 38:15.608
Not bad.

38:15.627 --> 38:18.369
Yeah, I... I detect a hint of...

38:18.463 --> 38:20.538
Grapes.

38:20.690 --> 38:21.923
Maybe, you know,
just a little bit.

38:25.304 --> 38:26.303
Did you miss me?

38:29.123 --> 38:30.598
I sure as hell missed you.

38:31.977 --> 38:33.459
Um...

38:33.478 --> 38:35.870
It gets pretty
lonely up here,

38:35.889 --> 38:37.129
as you well know.

38:37.223 --> 38:38.815
[chuckles]
Yeah.

38:42.062 --> 38:43.486
You make me so...

38:45.490 --> 38:47.657
I don't mean to, uh...

38:47.809 --> 38:48.992
-I'm sorry.
-No.

38:49.143 --> 38:50.885
I'm sorry.

38:50.904 --> 38:53.288
No, no, it's okay.
What? What are you saying?

38:56.893 --> 38:58.168
Do you know the story
behind the Taj Mahal?

38:59.821 --> 39:01.671
No, I don't, actually.

39:03.842 --> 39:05.400
An Indian emperor
built it for his wife

39:05.418 --> 39:08.845
who died in childbirth.

39:09.072 --> 39:10.996
Most people think
that it's a wedding gift.

39:11.091 --> 39:15.668
But in fact, it's a tomb.

39:15.687 --> 39:17.687
Which I think
makes it even more romantic.

39:20.174 --> 39:22.750
Yeah, I guess it does.

39:22.769 --> 39:26.196
When the emperor died, he was
laid to rest next to his wife.

39:28.091 --> 39:29.991
Now they're together forever.

39:31.094 --> 39:32.702
Wow.

39:52.057 --> 39:53.873
Um, wait, wait, um...

39:53.892 --> 39:55.892
Uh...

39:56.119 --> 39:57.060
What?

39:57.287 --> 39:59.120
Um...

39:59.139 --> 40:00.063
Are you...

40:01.382 --> 40:03.566
Are you sure about this?

40:06.071 --> 40:07.404
Very.

¶

40:48.447 --> 40:50.930
[panting]

40:50.949 --> 40:53.950
When we're together...

40:54.101 --> 40:55.952
the world stops.

40:56.103 --> 40:57.454
And life is complete.

41:04.521 --> 41:07.112
Hey, there.
I'm looking for an address.

41:07.132 --> 41:11.192
I do have a phone number
for the person I'm looking for.

41:11.285 --> 41:14.262
Um, can you help me with that?

41:15.365 --> 41:16.806
Name's Harry Johnson.

41:17.033 --> 41:18.216
Looking for my daughter,
Lacy Johnson,

41:18.310 --> 41:20.218
she's working out there,

41:20.370 --> 41:22.220
and there seems to be some kind
of complication with the phone,

41:22.314 --> 41:24.314
and I'm getting a little
worried, to be honest with you.

41:26.226 --> 41:31.821
It's 909-555-0143.

41:35.660 --> 41:36.826
I appreciate this.

41:51.325 --> 41:52.342
Mighty kind of you.

42:00.910 --> 42:02.602

[bell rings]

42:47.624 --> 42:48.806
Hey.

42:48.900 --> 42:50.400
Buongiorno, Bella.

42:53.980 --> 42:55.071
How are you doing?

42:56.316 --> 42:58.074
-Really good.
-Good.

43:03.081 --> 43:05.064
Could we, um...

43:05.083 --> 43:07.992
Can we talk about last night?

43:08.144 --> 43:10.328
Yeah, what about last night?

43:10.422 --> 43:11.671
Did something happen?

43:13.592 --> 43:15.091
You're joking, right?

43:19.489 --> 43:22.432
All right.
You have my attention.

43:30.257 --> 43:31.441
You don't remember.

43:33.612 --> 43:35.837
Remember what?

43:35.930 --> 43:38.189
You don't remember anything?

43:38.283 --> 43:40.508
Okay, you know, it wouldn't
be the first time

43:40.526 --> 43:43.769
that I offended someone
while I was immersing.

43:43.863 --> 43:48.532
I know I can be insufferable.
I just don't remember why.

43:48.685 --> 43:51.610
So if I said something

43:51.630 --> 43:54.714
that was rude or
inappropriate...

43:55.875 --> 43:57.050
I apologize.

44:12.208 --> 44:13.483
[panting]

44:17.213 --> 44:18.321
I'm stupid.

44:30.502 --> 44:31.584
Damn it!

45:44.075 --> 45:47.392
Best I felt since
I've been back from the war.

45:47.412 --> 45:51.063
The best I've felt since
I've been back from the war.

45:51.157 --> 45:52.582
The only love
that I've felt

45:52.809 --> 45:55.567
since I've been back
from the war.

45:55.661 --> 45:56.994
Back from the war.

45:57.146 --> 45:59.088
Back.
Back from...

46:03.152 --> 46:04.427
It's the first time
I felt love

46:04.654 --> 46:06.763
since I've been back
from the war.

46:06.914 --> 46:08.839
Why the war?

46:08.992 --> 46:10.683
How about ever? Ever?

46:13.997 --> 46:16.272
Honestly, honestly, sir.

46:16.499 --> 46:18.024
Honestly...

46:22.505 --> 46:23.354
Sir, I think we got started
on the wrong--

46:23.448 --> 46:27.450
No.
No, no.

46:30.847 --> 46:32.038
Again.

46:34.793 --> 46:38.294
In all honesty, sir,
she deserves happiness.

46:38.445 --> 46:39.295
I just want to get...

46:39.446 --> 46:42.206
Desmond. Stop resisting.

46:42.358 --> 46:43.299
Sir.

46:43.450 --> 46:44.300
My friend...

46:44.527 --> 46:46.285
Desmond.

46:46.304 --> 46:48.805
Desmond.

46:48.956 --> 46:52.308
It's okay, I got ya.
Just let go.

46:53.478 --> 46:54.811
And trust me.

Excuse me, sir.

Why don't you come out here?

Dispatch, come in.

50:10.675 --> 50:11.757
Dispatch!

50:23.079 --> 50:24.186
What are you doing here?

50:27.508 --> 50:30.342
Just got a call about the
girl that's staying here

50:30.361 --> 50:31.610
from her father.

50:33.105 --> 50:35.256
That old bastard.

Please.
Please.

All clear.

<i> Copy that.</i>

Thanks.

Hey, you don't need
to do this, okay?

51:12.570 --> 51:14.737

No one needs to know about this.

Can you turn it down?

It was a mistake.

Did you not enjoy yourself?

Well, I did, I just...

I think I'm...

53:47.225 --> 53:48.949
I'm the problem.

give me that crap.

the other night?

You want to try on

Remember you.

56:43.216 --> 56:45.459
And what do I get?

56:45.477 --> 56:47.628
What do you want?

56:47.646 --> 56:49.980
Your underwear.

56:50.132 --> 56:52.390
No, really?

56:52.410 --> 56:55.077
Oh, you're a kinky one,
aren't you?

56:55.228 --> 56:57.079
And can you sign it?

56:59.900 --> 57:02.066
Okay, I was wrong.
You're not kinky.

57:02.086 --> 57:03.377
You're deranged.

57:06.090 --> 57:07.756
Come on, let's see.
Let's see.

57:09.593 --> 57:11.743
Okay, just be really careful
with it,

57:11.762 --> 57:13.929
its super special to me.

57:20.162 --> 57:21.770
Oh...

57:25.926 --> 57:28.444
I like it.

57:32.007 --> 57:33.765
I love you.

57:33.784 --> 57:35.117
A lot.

58:18.996 --> 58:20.570
Hello.

58:20.664 --> 58:23.499
Lake Arrowhead Police
Department, please hold.

58:23.726 --> 58:24.500
God!

58:28.839 --> 58:30.655
Thank you for holding.

58:30.674 --> 58:33.416
Yes, my name's Harry.
I called yesterday.

58:33.511 --> 58:35.418
Sir, we left you a message.
Everything's fine.

58:35.513 --> 58:37.679
And I requested that my daughter
call me right away.

58:37.906 --> 58:39.181
Did the officer
tell her to do that?

58:39.332 --> 58:42.242
Sir, please calm down.

58:42.335 --> 58:44.686
I'm trying to stay calm, sir.

58:46.357 --> 58:49.173
I haven't spoken to
her since Tuesday.

58:49.193 --> 58:50.192
It's now Friday.

58:50.419 --> 58:51.434
You get it?

58:51.587 --> 58:53.086
<i> As I already told you, sir,</i>

58:53.105 --> 58:55.088
<i> Green Valley's</i>
<i> a couple of towns over.</i>

58:55.107 --> 58:56.848
They don't have a police force.

58:56.942 --> 58:58.367
It requires coordination.

58:58.518 --> 59:00.536
I'm not asking
you to cure cancer.

59:00.687 --> 59:05.707
Sir, have you considered
that maybe she's just busy?

59:05.934 --> 59:07.042
Yes.

59:07.269 --> 59:09.711
Yes, I have.

59:09.938 --> 59:12.047
Now, can I speak to someone
who can chew gum

59:12.198 --> 59:14.049
and walk at the same time?

59:22.951 --> 59:25.452
Lacy?

59:25.470 --> 59:27.062
What now?

59:34.146 --> 59:35.720
I can't find Sylvester.

59:35.739 --> 59:37.055
What do you mean?

59:37.074 --> 59:37.981
What do you mean
what do I mean?

59:38.133 --> 59:39.466
Is he in your room?

59:39.559 --> 59:40.801
-No, no, I was just there--
-Go check!

59:40.894 --> 59:42.226
I was just there,
he's not there.

59:42.321 --> 59:44.654
You must have left him outside.

59:44.807 --> 59:46.564
No, did you check under
your bed?

59:46.584 --> 59:48.158
I checked everywhere!

59:48.310 --> 59:49.751
What did you do last night?

59:49.978 --> 59:51.253
Were you in your room
at all times?

59:54.425 --> 59:56.316
Lacy, answer me!

59:56.409 --> 59:58.001
Well, after we fooled around,

59:58.153 --> 59:59.669
you took me to your room
and I was there for a bit.

59:59.763 --> 1:00:02.431
Then I went upstairs.

1:00:02.582 --> 1:00:03.390
What did you just say?

1:00:04.768 --> 1:00:06.584
That--

1:00:06.604 --> 1:00:08.829
Did you interact with me
last night during my immersion?

1:00:08.922 --> 1:00:11.848
-Well, yes, we... we...
-We, we what?

1:00:12.000 --> 1:00:13.516
We fooled around,
you know, that.

1:00:13.669 --> 1:00:16.503
No, I don't
and no, we did not.

1:00:16.521 --> 1:00:18.688
Stop lying.

1:00:18.782 --> 1:00:21.742
If I was lying, how did you
get my bracelet on your wrist?

1:00:26.365 --> 1:00:29.941
You took advantage of me
when I specifically asked you

1:00:29.960 --> 1:00:32.294
to stay in your room
and out of my way!

1:00:34.039 --> 1:00:35.856
I, you're...

1:00:35.949 --> 1:00:38.300
Please just shut your mouth.

1:00:39.695 --> 1:00:41.803
Your conduct is unacceptable.

1:00:42.030 --> 1:00:45.289
I have no choice
but to tell Sharon.

1:00:45.309 --> 1:00:46.383
You know, I'm just going to
go look for Sylvester,

1:00:46.535 --> 1:00:48.268
because I bet you
I can find him.

1:00:54.059 --> 1:00:55.442
Here, Kitty, Kitty.

1:00:59.490 --> 1:01:00.447
Sylvester.

1:01:11.243 --> 1:01:12.501
Here, kitty, kitty.

1:01:17.675 --> 1:01:19.508
Damn it.

1:01:43.592 --> 1:01:45.033
No.

1:02:07.057 --> 1:02:08.348
Um...

1:02:09.952 --> 1:02:10.726
Do you...

1:02:13.138 --> 1:02:15.622
Can you help me
change my flat tire?

1:02:15.640 --> 1:02:16.857
You didn't find him yet,
did you?

1:02:18.551 --> 1:02:21.628
No, I'm sorry.
I looked everywhere.

1:02:21.721 --> 1:02:23.313
I need you to call Sharon.

1:02:23.465 --> 1:02:24.631
That's a great idea.

1:02:24.649 --> 1:02:25.824
I need you out of here.

1:02:27.393 --> 1:02:29.077
Clean up this mess
and pack your bags.

1:02:31.306 --> 1:02:33.231
I said, call Sharon.

1:02:33.250 --> 1:02:35.825
I can't because you
broke the phone jacks

1:02:35.978 --> 1:02:37.827
when you ripped it
out of the wall.

1:02:37.921 --> 1:02:39.588
You don't need the phone jack.

1:02:39.739 --> 1:02:42.148
All you need
is to connect the wires.

1:02:42.167 --> 1:02:43.759
I'm going to be in my room.

1:02:43.910 --> 1:02:46.410
Would you just have this
cleaned up before nightfall?

1:02:46.505 --> 1:02:48.555
Or just be in your room.
Okay?

1:02:49.916 --> 1:02:52.583
Wait, you're rehearsing today?

1:02:52.677 --> 1:02:56.062
No. I'm going to quit acting and
move to the Alaskan wilderness.

1:03:01.353 --> 1:03:02.277
God.

1:03:10.770 --> 1:03:12.621
I'm sorry, but I really...

1:03:12.848 --> 1:03:14.531
Have you packed yet?

1:03:14.625 --> 1:03:17.608
Just really need your help
to either fix the phone

1:03:17.628 --> 1:03:19.035
or help me fix my car.

1:03:19.129 --> 1:03:20.520
This may surprise you,

1:03:20.539 --> 1:03:23.373
but assisting the
assistant assistant

1:03:23.525 --> 1:03:25.358
who was supposed
to be assisting me

1:03:25.377 --> 1:03:28.053
is not part of my job.
Figure it out.

1:03:29.622 --> 1:03:31.473
Please just help me
fix the phone,

1:03:31.624 --> 1:03:33.791
I just... I just want
to call Sharon,

1:03:33.885 --> 1:03:36.478
and I'm really, really sorry

1:03:36.705 --> 1:03:39.039
that obviously I'm not
a great match for you,

1:03:39.132 --> 1:03:40.707
but I am just
a glorified receptionist.

1:03:40.800 --> 1:03:42.651
You know, I...
I answer calls.

1:03:42.878 --> 1:03:44.152
I manage schedules.

1:03:44.304 --> 1:03:47.380
I obviously do not
belong in Hollywood.

1:03:47.473 --> 1:03:50.325
Okay, tomorrow.
If I feel like it.

1:03:51.978 --> 1:03:54.496
I just want to call a cab.

1:03:54.723 --> 1:03:56.072
You know, like I will
literally send a tow truck

1:03:56.224 --> 1:03:57.740
for my car,

1:03:57.835 --> 1:03:59.167
and I just want to be back
in Arizona with my dad,

1:03:59.394 --> 1:04:00.910
and you never have to
hear from me ever again.

1:04:01.004 --> 1:04:03.338
I said tomorrow, okay?

1:04:06.084 --> 1:04:07.342
Okay, if you're not going
to help me,

1:04:07.493 --> 1:04:09.419
I will literally
walk back to L.A.

1:04:09.571 --> 1:04:10.470
Why wait?

1:04:11.573 --> 1:04:13.515
God!

1:04:13.666 --> 1:04:16.242
I don't know what kind of sick,
twisted games you are playing.

1:04:16.261 --> 1:04:20.856
But there is no way that you can
be blaming all of this on me,

1:04:21.083 --> 1:04:23.750
Immersing and completely
disassociating

1:04:23.843 --> 1:04:25.768
like it's
an out of body experience?

1:04:25.863 --> 1:04:27.178
Whoa, that is my job.

1:04:27.272 --> 1:04:28.588
You know what, if anything,

1:04:28.607 --> 1:04:30.423
you have been
taking advantage of me

1:04:30.442 --> 1:04:33.426
and I've just been too blinded
by your stupid status

1:04:33.519 --> 1:04:35.595
to even realize,
but you know what, I...

1:04:35.614 --> 1:04:37.205
I am going to tell
Sharon everything.

1:04:37.357 --> 1:04:39.165
And I am leaving tomorrow.

1:04:44.789 --> 1:04:45.964
That girl's gone crazy.

1:05:33.004 --> 1:05:34.412
Can I help you?

1:05:34.431 --> 1:05:36.839
You must be, uh...

1:05:36.992 --> 1:05:38.850
Darn, I forgot your name.

1:05:40.437 --> 1:05:42.420
You must be trespassing.

1:05:42.514 --> 1:05:44.422

1:05:48.612 --> 1:05:49.852
Nope.

1:05:50.005 --> 1:05:51.446
You're lost.

1:06:04.869 --> 1:06:05.794

1:06:09.132 --> 1:06:10.781
What are you...

1:06:10.875 --> 1:06:12.375
How did you find me?

1:06:12.527 --> 1:06:14.302
I'm just passing through.

1:06:19.551 --> 1:06:20.809
I'm so happy you're here.

1:06:22.962 --> 1:06:24.554
Just wait for me in the car,
I'm going to get my stuff.

1:06:24.648 --> 1:06:26.130
I'm leaving with you.

1:06:26.149 --> 1:06:27.707
What's wrong?

1:06:27.726 --> 1:06:28.817
I'll tell you when
we're on the road.

1:06:31.379 --> 1:06:33.471
Now you're leaving?

1:06:33.490 --> 1:06:37.400
I'm sorry. We just...
We have a family emergency.

1:06:37.494 --> 1:06:38.576
I have to go.

1:06:42.666 --> 1:06:44.833
Are things always this
strange around here?

1:06:47.153 --> 1:06:48.911
No, it's fine.

1:06:49.006 --> 1:06:50.422
We're great together.

1:06:54.569 --> 1:06:55.844
Good.

1:07:03.745 --> 1:07:05.311
She never takes this off.

1:07:07.415 --> 1:07:08.440
She's never this flustered.

1:07:11.603 --> 1:07:13.695
Look my friend,

1:07:13.846 --> 1:07:15.196
I think we got started
off on the wrong foot. Hmm?

1:07:16.700 --> 1:07:17.532
I'm allergic.

1:07:26.434 --> 1:07:28.043
I want to make your daughter
very happy.

1:07:29.954 --> 1:07:31.880
What do you mean?

1:07:32.031 --> 1:07:32.881
Well, look...

1:07:35.777 --> 1:07:36.959
I'd like to ask for your
permission

1:07:37.112 --> 1:07:38.219
for her hand in marriage.

1:07:41.633 --> 1:07:42.682
Is that a joke?

1:07:44.227 --> 1:07:45.393
No, of course not.

1:07:46.971 --> 1:07:48.955
I realize there is
an age difference.

Listen, you may be
a nice fella and all that,

1:07:54.071 --> 1:07:55.361
but I need to get her back home.

1:13:48.816 --> 1:13:50.650
Dad!

1:13:50.668 --> 1:13:52.093
Dad!

1:13:54.505 --> 1:13:57.506
Run, Lacy. Run!

1:13:57.600 --> 1:14:00.017
Her name is Angie!

1:14:02.497 --> 1:14:03.771
[shrieks]

1:14:16.511 --> 1:14:17.743
[panting]

1:14:23.685 --> 1:14:24.542
Where are you going?

1:14:28.781 --> 1:14:29.755
Come back.

1:14:35.697 --> 1:14:36.971
Angie?

1:14:41.311 --> 1:14:42.935
[sobs]

1:14:56.067 --> 1:14:57.658
Dad, Dad.

1:14:57.885 --> 1:14:59.994
Dad. Daddy.

1:15:00.221 --> 1:15:01.245
[sobbing]

1:15:03.241 --> 1:15:04.832
Daddy, wake up.

1:15:05.059 --> 1:15:07.668
Daddy, you're okay.
You're okay, Daddy.

1:15:11.399 --> 1:15:12.924
No!

1:15:16.846 --> 1:15:18.346
Angie.

1:15:21.518 --> 1:15:22.517
Why did you run?

1:15:41.704 --> 1:15:42.954
I'm sorry, Leo.

1:15:45.208 --> 1:15:47.950
You're my angel.

1:15:48.102 --> 1:15:50.545
Baby...

1:15:55.051 --> 1:15:57.534
...if you run...

1:15:57.554 --> 1:15:59.703
I don't care.

1:15:59.797 --> 1:16:02.557
You and I were meant to be.

1:16:03.893 --> 1:16:05.968
We're soulmates.

1:16:06.062 --> 1:16:06.978
When we're together...

1:16:08.064 --> 1:16:09.471
The whole world stops.

1:16:09.566 --> 1:16:12.233
And life is complete.

1:16:15.054 --> 1:16:17.363
I love you so much, Angie.

1:16:19.409 --> 1:16:23.411
My name is Lacy.

1:16:41.264 --> 1:16:42.555
Suspect down.

1:16:54.669 --> 1:16:56.277
[beeping]

1:17:03.845 --> 1:17:07.455
Oh, hello, I'm Dr. Baggett,
I'm the attending physician.

1:17:07.682 --> 1:17:08.789
Hi.

1:17:11.535 --> 1:17:13.185
The nurse mentioned
someone was here.

1:17:13.278 --> 1:17:15.296
Are you a
relative by any chance?

1:17:15.447 --> 1:17:19.358
No. I am her boss.

1:17:19.377 --> 1:17:20.635
Oh, okay.

1:17:22.639 --> 1:17:24.454
How's she doing?

1:17:24.474 --> 1:17:26.031
She's stable.

1:17:26.125 --> 1:17:28.550
We had to induce
a coma for the surgery.

1:17:28.645 --> 1:17:31.461
A projectile penetrated
really close to her heart.

1:17:31.481 --> 1:17:33.147
Bottom line, she's a
really lucky young lady.

1:17:34.633 --> 1:17:36.484
Yeah, it's good.

1:17:36.635 --> 1:17:38.152
Don't worry,
we're monitoring her.

1:17:38.303 --> 1:17:41.897
We'll probably bring you back
in a couple days.

1:17:41.991 --> 1:17:44.400
Oh, by the way,
I wanted to wait for a relative,

1:17:44.552 --> 1:17:46.051
but since you're here,
maybe you can help us.

1:17:46.145 --> 1:17:48.070
We found this in her possession.

1:17:48.222 --> 1:17:49.738
Two of these a day.

1:17:49.891 --> 1:17:51.314
They're for his stomach,
he always forgets.

1:17:51.334 --> 1:17:53.834
I don't know, he's sampling
something new.

1:17:54.061 --> 1:17:55.336
What's that?

1:17:55.487 --> 1:17:57.229
Haldol.
It's an antipsychotic.

1:17:57.248 --> 1:18:00.082
It's normally used in the
treatment of schizophrenia.

1:18:00.234 --> 1:18:01.676
These are a life saver.

1:18:06.498 --> 1:18:08.015
I had never heard of that.

1:18:09.410 --> 1:18:11.076
Was there a name on it?

1:18:11.095 --> 1:18:13.245
No, I checked the system
and didn't see any

1:18:13.338 --> 1:18:16.081
outstanding prescriptions,

1:18:16.100 --> 1:18:17.917
but you know what? It's probably
samples or something.

1:18:17.935 --> 1:18:19.418
-Yeah.
-You know, and it's all good.

1:18:19.437 --> 1:18:21.529
I'll just ask
her when she wakes up.

1:18:21.756 --> 1:18:23.680
Yeah, but I do have
to get back to my rounds.

1:18:23.700 --> 1:18:25.758
But if you need anything

1:18:25.851 --> 1:18:28.202
nurse's station is right there,
downstairs is the food court.

1:18:28.353 --> 1:18:30.262
But don't worry,
she's in good hands.

1:18:30.355 --> 1:18:31.521
Thank you.

1:18:31.541 --> 1:18:32.522
Awesome.
Lovely meeting you.

1:18:32.542 --> 1:18:33.541
You have a great day.

1:18:41.609 --> 1:18:42.633
So sorry.

1:18:55.790 --> 1:18:57.398
