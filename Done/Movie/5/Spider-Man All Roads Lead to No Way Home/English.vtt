WEBVTT

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.209
- You must be Peter.
- Yeah.

00:00:08.242 --> 00:00:10.078
- Hi. How you doing?
- Dad, this is Peter.

00:00:10.111 --> 00:00:11.812
You know who I am...

00:00:11.845 --> 00:00:13.514
Your friendly neighborhood
Spider-Man.

00:00:13.547 --> 00:00:15.049
I didn't believe it at first.

00:00:15.083 --> 00:00:17.818
When they called initially,
I was like, "Finally."

00:00:19.053 --> 00:00:20.988
The nerd in me,
the fanboy in me,

00:00:21.021 --> 00:00:23.224
on so many levels, said yes.

00:00:23.257 --> 00:00:26.060
To be here today with you two,
it's, like, mind-blowing.

00:00:27.728 --> 00:00:29.230
- Peter.
- Yeah?

00:00:29.263 --> 00:00:30.831
Oh, sorry, did you mean...

00:00:30.864 --> 00:00:32.700
I don't remember
where the idea started,

00:00:32.733 --> 00:00:33.901
but just talking through it,

00:00:33.934 --> 00:00:35.503
it was like,
"That would be crazy.

00:00:35.536 --> 00:00:37.838
That's impossible.
How do we do it?"

00:00:37.871 --> 00:00:39.507
All right, let's get to work!

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.275
This character moves me

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.444
in a way that
very few things do.

00:00:43.477 --> 00:00:46.247
To see this come together
was really moving to me.

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.184
Wow. This is going to be
deeply special for people,

00:00:50.218 --> 00:00:52.120
and for me, as a fan,

00:00:52.153 --> 00:00:54.288
and I just feel
incredibly grateful.

00:00:54.322 --> 00:00:57.225
It's like nearly 20 years worth of
cinema coming together for one film.

00:00:57.258 --> 00:00:59.193
To now sit back and watch that
is really amazing.

00:00:59.227 --> 00:01:00.594
Hello.

00:01:00.628 --> 00:01:02.306
Am I becoming an
elder statesman? Maybe I am.

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:05.065
It warranted
the biggest solo superhero movie

00:01:05.099 --> 00:01:06.934
that's ever been made.

00:01:06.967 --> 00:01:09.270
It's a continuum of Spider-Man.

00:01:09.303 --> 00:01:11.739
All of these movies
are now part of the same thing.

00:01:11.772 --> 00:01:14.242
- You're getting on my nerves.
- I have a knack for that.

00:01:14.275 --> 00:01:15.776
Knock it off, man! No!

00:01:16.744 --> 00:01:18.412
It's so layered.

00:01:18.446 --> 00:01:20.614
It's so nostalgic
and opens up the multiverse

00:01:20.648 --> 00:01:22.816
and allows for us to have...

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:24.485
I didn't catch it.

00:01:25.819 --> 00:01:26.920
It's worthy of Spider-Man.

00:01:27.521 --> 00:01:30.924
I want Spider-Man!

00:01:30.958 --> 00:01:33.661
It was nice to be able to have
everything coalesce into,

00:01:33.694 --> 00:01:34.828
at its essence,

00:01:34.862 --> 00:01:37.131
this simple story of Spider-Man.

00:01:38.199 --> 00:01:39.967
Whoo-hoo!

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.509
What up, web slingers?

00:01:48.542 --> 00:01:50.778
This is my good friend
Martin Starr.

00:01:50.811 --> 00:01:52.580
This is my good buddy
J.B. Smoove.

00:01:52.613 --> 00:01:54.182
You want the first shift
or the second?

00:01:54.215 --> 00:01:55.583
I could take either.

00:01:55.616 --> 00:01:57.951
Give me the third shift.
I took an Ambien.

00:01:57.985 --> 00:02:00.120
We welcome you to
All Roads Lead to No Way Home,

00:02:00.154 --> 00:02:02.756
a look back at 20 years
of the Spider-Man movies.

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:03.790
Whoo!

00:02:05.393 --> 00:02:08.095
- Nice knowing you, Spider-Man.
- Wait, excuse me?

00:02:08.128 --> 00:02:09.830
The entire world's
about to forget

00:02:09.863 --> 00:02:11.365
that Peter Parker is Spider-Man.

00:02:13.133 --> 00:02:15.269
Introduced by the great
Stan Lee and Steve Ditko

00:02:15.303 --> 00:02:19.440
in the pages of Amazing Fantasy,
number 15, way back in 1962,

00:02:19.473 --> 00:02:23.277
Spider-Man wowed comic book readers
at the time and never looked back.

00:02:23.311 --> 00:02:24.778
Whoo!

00:02:24.812 --> 00:02:27.615
Spawning everything
from cartoons to Underoos...

00:02:27.648 --> 00:02:28.949
I had a pair of Underoos...

00:02:28.982 --> 00:02:31.319
To eight films and counting.

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:33.820
Here we go.

00:02:39.993 --> 00:02:41.695
What just happened?

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:44.698
It all began with the
original Tobey Maguire trilogy

00:02:44.732 --> 00:02:46.634
from the early 2000s,

00:02:46.667 --> 00:02:49.470
which set a new standard for how
superhero movies should operate.

00:02:49.503 --> 00:02:51.739
Those early
Tobey Maguire-Sam Raimi

00:02:51.772 --> 00:02:53.641
Spidey films

00:02:53.674 --> 00:02:56.076
were very influential on me
as a filmmaker.

00:02:56.109 --> 00:02:59.980
Sam understood these movies
in a way that is very profound.

00:03:00.013 --> 00:03:03.884
It's like a character study
within this superhero film.

00:03:06.887 --> 00:03:07.921
Go get 'em, tiger.

00:03:10.358 --> 00:03:12.092
And then came

00:03:12.125 --> 00:03:14.728
the Andrew Garfield
Amazing Spider-Man reboot,

00:03:14.762 --> 00:03:18.198
blending slick visual style
with more immersive action

00:03:18.232 --> 00:03:21.669
while bringing some all-time
great Spider-Man bad guys

00:03:21.702 --> 00:03:23.904
to the big screen
for the first time.

00:03:25.072 --> 00:03:26.907
An amazing sequel would follow,

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:28.742
and then something
incredible happened.

00:03:28.776 --> 00:03:31.111
I gotta go, I gotta go!

00:03:31.144 --> 00:03:33.523
Spider-Man joined the highly
successful Marvel Cinematic Universe.

00:03:33.547 --> 00:03:34.882
Hey, everyone.

00:03:34.915 --> 00:03:36.350
To direct their new film,

00:03:36.384 --> 00:03:38.619
series producers turned
to director Jon Watts,

00:03:38.652 --> 00:03:42.556
whose series really gets back to
the character's high school roots,

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:45.058
injecting his stories
with youth, humor

00:03:45.092 --> 00:03:47.695
and massive MCU-sized action.

00:03:47.728 --> 00:03:49.430
It's great to just go back,

00:03:49.463 --> 00:03:52.400
figuring out any other things
that we could connect,

00:03:52.433 --> 00:03:54.802
'cause I just want it
to be a complete world,

00:03:54.835 --> 00:03:56.904
so that in the end,
it does feel like one story.

00:03:56.937 --> 00:03:59.573
I just love Spider-Man,
and I want to do it justice.

00:03:59.607 --> 00:04:02.075
Now, Watts definitely
has the Midas touch.

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:03.544
Action!

00:04:03.577 --> 00:04:05.212
Including
having the foresight to cast

00:04:05.245 --> 00:04:07.881
two incredibly talented
supporting actors

00:04:07.915 --> 00:04:10.651
who elevate
everything they touch.

00:04:10.684 --> 00:04:12.219
Zendaya and Jacob.

00:04:12.252 --> 00:04:13.563
That must be
who you're talking about.

00:04:13.587 --> 00:04:16.156
Whoa, hey, look.
I appreciate you, bro.

00:04:17.625 --> 00:04:19.135
I'm talking about us, Martin.
They're great.

00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:21.462
What?
You and me!

00:04:21.495 --> 00:04:23.340
- Oh, yeah, right.
- I mean, we're pretty great.

00:04:23.364 --> 00:04:24.432
That is false.

00:04:24.465 --> 00:04:25.799
What'd I tell you

00:04:25.833 --> 00:04:27.110
about using the bell
for comedic purposes?

00:04:27.134 --> 00:04:28.736
Mr. Harrington
and Mr. Dell do

00:04:28.769 --> 00:04:30.609
a lot of the heavy lifting
in the recent films.

00:04:30.638 --> 00:04:32.306
Mr. Dell and I
have it under control!

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:34.274
Oh, no, no!
Don't drag me into this, Roger!

00:04:34.308 --> 00:04:36.076
I'm doing my best, Julius!

00:04:36.109 --> 00:04:37.745
But this isn't just about us.

00:04:37.778 --> 00:04:40.681
This is about getting
the folks at home up to speed

00:04:40.714 --> 00:04:42.350
on the Spider-Man movie history.
Whoa.

00:04:42.383 --> 00:04:44.452
You are absolutely right.
Thank you.

00:04:44.485 --> 00:04:49.156
Because a hero's work
is never done!

00:04:49.189 --> 00:04:50.524
That sounds familiar.

00:04:53.794 --> 00:04:56.730
I believe there's a hero
in all of us.

00:04:57.698 --> 00:04:59.333
Gives us strength.

00:04:59.367 --> 00:05:01.802
Even though sometimes
we have to give up

00:05:01.835 --> 00:05:03.337
the thing we want the most.

00:05:04.738 --> 00:05:07.808
You have a gift.
You have power.

00:05:07.841 --> 00:05:09.677
Are you going to step up or not?

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:12.145
I don't know if that's me.
I'm not Iron Man.

00:05:14.582 --> 00:05:17.117
- I made a choice.
- It's my gift.

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:18.852
This is my path.

00:05:18.886 --> 00:05:21.054
This is my chance
to prove myself.

00:05:22.089 --> 00:05:24.024
- Who am I?
- Peter.

00:05:24.057 --> 00:05:25.693
- Peter!
- Hello, Peter.

00:05:25.726 --> 00:05:27.561
I'm just Peter Parker.

00:05:30.063 --> 00:05:31.965
Spidey's suits change,

00:05:31.999 --> 00:05:33.701
and evil villains come and go,

00:05:33.734 --> 00:05:36.404
but there's always been
one constant anchoring

00:05:36.437 --> 00:05:38.305
all the Spider-Man films,

00:05:38.338 --> 00:05:42.009
-and that's the one and only Peter Parker.
- Heard of him.

00:05:42.042 --> 00:05:43.644
People think
Spider-Man is a man,

00:05:43.677 --> 00:05:44.888
that he's this grown superhero,

00:05:44.912 --> 00:05:46.414
but he's really not.

00:05:46.447 --> 00:05:48.181
He's a kid with
everyday kid problems.

00:05:48.215 --> 00:05:49.817
What's up, guys?

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:53.353
Peter Parker is such
an international character

00:05:53.387 --> 00:05:57.190
because I believe that there
is a Peter Parker in all of us.

00:05:57.224 --> 00:05:58.926
They love me.

00:05:58.959 --> 00:06:01.729
Peter Parker brings something
to everybody, doesn't he?

00:06:01.762 --> 00:06:03.363
Yes!

00:06:03.397 --> 00:06:04.865
I think
the essence of Peter Parker

00:06:04.898 --> 00:06:06.166
is gonna be constant,

00:06:06.199 --> 00:06:08.536
no matter how
the character is played.

00:06:08.569 --> 00:06:11.505
That fundamental idea that, "With great
power comes great responsibility,"

00:06:11.539 --> 00:06:13.182
and Peter's trying to use
it do the right thing.

00:06:13.206 --> 00:06:16.209
I am the most famous person
in the entire world.

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:18.879
And I'm still broke.

00:06:20.781 --> 00:06:22.015
Back in 2002,

00:06:22.049 --> 00:06:24.251
Tobey Maguire became
the first actor

00:06:24.284 --> 00:06:27.220
to bring Peter Parker to life
on the big screen.

00:06:27.254 --> 00:06:29.757
I just was looking
at this character,

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:33.360
and Sam's vision
and then how I read the script

00:06:33.393 --> 00:06:34.928
and what
I wanted to do with him,

00:06:34.962 --> 00:06:37.565
and then sometimes
I'd put on tights

00:06:37.598 --> 00:06:39.867
and get on wires and stuff.

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:43.604
Audiences were immediately drawn to
his likable, off-kilter delivery...

00:06:43.637 --> 00:06:44.872
Okay.

00:06:44.905 --> 00:06:46.025
And transformed physique.

00:06:48.075 --> 00:06:50.644
It is a bit like
jumping out of a plane

00:06:50.678 --> 00:06:53.947
and figuring out how the
chute works on your way down.

00:06:53.981 --> 00:06:56.717
Whoo-hoo!

00:06:56.750 --> 00:06:59.987
It's about finding the soul
of the character in a performer,

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:02.155
and that's what
Sam did with Tobey,

00:07:02.189 --> 00:07:04.157
and that's what
we've strived to do

00:07:04.191 --> 00:07:06.159
on all of our MCU films since.

00:07:06.193 --> 00:07:07.928
And Tobey really showcased that.

00:07:07.961 --> 00:07:10.130
He was embracing the core
of what the character was

00:07:10.163 --> 00:07:11.231
from the comics.

00:07:11.264 --> 00:07:12.466
I forgive you.

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:14.802
Five years later,

00:07:14.835 --> 00:07:17.404
the baton was passed to
British actor Andrew Garfield,

00:07:17.437 --> 00:07:20.741
who played Peter Parker
in two Amazing Spider-Man films.

00:07:20.774 --> 00:07:23.110
A self-professed Spider-fan,

00:07:23.143 --> 00:07:24.645
Garfield landed his dream gig.

00:07:24.678 --> 00:07:28.482
I had to fight a lizard today,

00:07:28.516 --> 00:07:30.584
but it was not
an ordinary lizard.

00:07:30.618 --> 00:07:34.755
Did you know he even did yoga
and pilates to gain flexibility

00:07:34.788 --> 00:07:36.857
when striking
those famous Spidey poses?

00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:39.192
- Oh, yeah.
- The one where he puts his legs like this?

00:07:39.226 --> 00:07:41.529
Or when he jumps from a
building and lands like this?

00:07:41.562 --> 00:07:44.665
Don't pop your hip out.
We got a lot more to do here.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:48.869
Well, I need
to be all limbered up

00:07:48.902 --> 00:07:50.437
to properly introduce

00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:53.641
the third and current
incarnation of Peter Parker.

00:07:53.674 --> 00:07:55.509
- My man...
- Tom Holland!

00:07:55.543 --> 00:07:58.145
An accomplished British actor

00:07:58.178 --> 00:07:59.680
as well as an experienced dancer

00:07:59.713 --> 00:08:01.515
capable of doing
many of his own stunts.

00:08:01.549 --> 00:08:03.551
That was better.

00:08:03.584 --> 00:08:07.555
Tom has taken the role of
Peter/Spidey and run with it,

00:08:07.588 --> 00:08:10.157
redefining the character for
a whole new generation of fans.

00:08:10.190 --> 00:08:12.560
What makes Tom
so good and genuine

00:08:12.593 --> 00:08:15.663
is that he performs Spider-Man
with his whole body.

00:08:15.696 --> 00:08:17.064
Yeah, man.

00:08:17.097 --> 00:08:19.499
And under my expert
mentorship and tutelage,

00:08:19.533 --> 00:08:21.569
Tom gives you
the total package...

00:08:21.602 --> 00:08:25.639
Charisma, humor,
relatability, vulnerability,

00:08:25.673 --> 00:08:27.641
those signature
sophomoric quips.

00:08:27.675 --> 00:08:31.278
I'm starting to think
you're not the Avengers.

00:08:35.248 --> 00:08:36.950
That's so good!

00:08:43.023 --> 00:08:46.426
When they put all three of us
on camera for the first time

00:08:46.459 --> 00:08:47.595
in our suits,

00:08:47.628 --> 00:08:49.830
we all just burst out laughing.

00:08:49.863 --> 00:08:52.332
Just kind of spontaneously,
all looking at each other

00:08:52.365 --> 00:08:54.568
like, "This is so weird,
but I love it."

00:08:54.602 --> 00:08:57.037
It was like
me and Tobey arrived,

00:08:57.070 --> 00:08:59.006
and all of their arms
were just kind of open.

00:08:59.039 --> 00:09:01.842
So we were just, like, enfolded
into the nucleus with them.

00:09:01.875 --> 00:09:03.777
It's like Spider-Man heaven.

00:09:03.811 --> 00:09:06.914
I felt really connected
and really appreciated.

00:09:06.947 --> 00:09:10.350
There was a sense
of coming back to something,

00:09:10.383 --> 00:09:14.554
and working with Andrew and Tom

00:09:14.588 --> 00:09:16.156
was really dear to me.

00:09:17.157 --> 00:09:19.192
The interaction and the respect

00:09:19.226 --> 00:09:23.096
between Tobey Maguire and
Andrew Garfield and Tom Holland

00:09:23.130 --> 00:09:25.132
is really something.

00:09:25.165 --> 00:09:26.834
I think I can...

00:09:30.337 --> 00:09:33.406
To see them in their suits
and to laugh and joke

00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:36.744
and swap stories about their
experiences and my experiences,

00:09:36.777 --> 00:09:39.546
that has been the highlight
of my Spider-Man career,

00:09:39.579 --> 00:09:42.115
getting to share it
with those guys.

00:09:43.150 --> 00:09:45.285
It resulted in this
very, very beautiful experience

00:09:45.318 --> 00:09:49.156
where I got to have
a bit more closure on something

00:09:49.189 --> 00:09:50.958
that means so much to me.

00:09:50.991 --> 00:09:52.425
Are you okay?

00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:55.262
I liked the idea
that they show up

00:09:55.295 --> 00:09:57.931
helping Peter complete his arc
and to make the right decision

00:09:57.965 --> 00:10:00.100
and maybe not make
the mistakes that they made.

00:10:00.133 --> 00:10:02.069
But along the way, you know,

00:10:02.102 --> 00:10:04.104
they get some closure as well

00:10:04.137 --> 00:10:06.106
and some catharsis
on their story lines.

00:10:06.974 --> 00:10:08.341
I love you guys.

00:10:10.811 --> 00:10:12.612
Thank you.
Thank you.

00:10:13.546 --> 00:10:15.315
All right, let's do this.
Let's go.

00:10:20.287 --> 00:10:23.023
Pumpkin bomb.

00:10:23.056 --> 00:10:25.125
I love me some Spider-Man,

00:10:25.158 --> 00:10:27.327
but I freaking love
all the crazy villains.

00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:28.595
You know what I mean?

00:10:28.628 --> 00:10:30.330
The Green Goblin, Electro,

00:10:30.363 --> 00:10:33.834
that disco-ball-headed guy
with the Mexican wrestling name.

00:10:33.867 --> 00:10:36.136
- My name is Mysterio.
- Cool name.

00:10:36.169 --> 00:10:39.206
They're super cool bad guys, no
doubt, but they are even cooler

00:10:39.239 --> 00:10:41.675
thanks to the amazing actors
who played them.

00:10:41.709 --> 00:10:44.044
I think the beauty
of these franchises

00:10:44.077 --> 00:10:47.881
is that the fact that
you have such talented actors.

00:10:47.915 --> 00:10:49.950
With all these guys,
you can't miss.

00:10:49.983 --> 00:10:53.453
The Norman Osborn character
is sort of a tragic figure

00:10:53.486 --> 00:10:55.723
and something
I could get behind.

00:10:55.756 --> 00:10:57.858
It was fun to play that role.

00:10:57.891 --> 00:11:00.694
You know, I'm something of
a scientist myself.

00:11:02.763 --> 00:11:04.564
Octavius knows what I can do.

00:11:04.597 --> 00:11:06.166
In a lesser environment,

00:11:06.199 --> 00:11:09.136
us as villains,
we would just be functionaries.

00:11:09.169 --> 00:11:11.538
We would just be there to,
you know, get the plot going.

00:11:11.571 --> 00:11:15.642
But here, we've got real story lines.
They are real people.

00:11:15.675 --> 00:11:19.546
In the first film, you had crazy-eyed
Willem Dafoe as the Green Goblin...

00:11:21.614 --> 00:11:24.417
wearing that emerald
nightmare right over there.

00:11:24.451 --> 00:11:26.820
I love that outfit. I'll wear
it to a nightclub. Iconic.

00:11:28.922 --> 00:11:30.557
You want to know the truth?

00:11:30.590 --> 00:11:34.461
Nobody knows how uncomfortable
those costumes are.

00:11:35.062 --> 00:11:39.432
We had the amazing performance
from Alfred Molina as Doc Ock.

00:11:39.466 --> 00:11:43.103
It's been very nice to come back
to something that is familiar,

00:11:43.136 --> 00:11:44.938
but, at the same time,
completely new.

00:11:44.972 --> 00:11:46.373
Looks like we got competition.

00:11:46.406 --> 00:11:48.408
There's some real depth to it,

00:11:48.441 --> 00:11:49.886
and that's what
makes them interesting.

00:11:49.910 --> 00:11:50.920
I'm sorry
what was your name again?

00:11:50.944 --> 00:11:52.813
Dr. Otto Octavius.

00:11:53.814 --> 00:11:55.582
No.

00:11:55.615 --> 00:11:57.951
There's no way your name's
Dr. Otto Octavius.

00:11:58.786 --> 00:11:59.953
Wait, seriously?

00:11:59.987 --> 00:12:01.088
Cut.

00:12:02.255 --> 00:12:05.058
We met Venom
for the first time. Ooh.

00:12:05.092 --> 00:12:08.295
Thomas Haden Church
played a killer Sandman too,

00:12:08.328 --> 00:12:10.964
looking like he came straight
out of the comic book.

00:12:10.998 --> 00:12:12.866
Or the beach.

00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:16.103
We were treated to Rhys Ifans
as the Lizard.

00:12:18.105 --> 00:12:20.073
A quick cameo from Paul Giamatti
as the Rhino...

00:12:22.309 --> 00:12:23.743
Jamie Fox as Electro.

00:12:23.777 --> 00:12:25.779
You got a lot of
great minds here, man.

00:12:25.813 --> 00:12:28.982
When you have that type of
dynamite, that type of TNT,

00:12:29.016 --> 00:12:30.726
I mean, people are gonna
go along for the ride.

00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:32.085
I think people
are gonna marvel...

00:12:32.119 --> 00:12:34.955
Oh!
Man!

00:12:34.988 --> 00:12:37.557
And poor Dane DeHaan
literally fell apart

00:12:37.590 --> 00:12:39.960
to become the new Green Goblin.

00:12:42.129 --> 00:12:44.497
But how are you gonna top Michael
freaking Keaton as Vulture?

00:12:44.531 --> 00:12:45.732
Can't be done!

00:12:45.765 --> 00:12:47.600
He was so intimidating,

00:12:47.634 --> 00:12:49.136
it required
no acting on my behalf

00:12:49.169 --> 00:12:50.938
because I'm just
meant to be terrified.

00:12:50.971 --> 00:12:54.007
There is no one who could play
that role better than he could.

00:12:54.041 --> 00:12:55.909
I thought this was
the antigravity gun.

00:12:55.943 --> 00:12:57.144
No, that's that one.

00:12:58.111 --> 00:12:59.646
Oh, come on.

00:12:59.679 --> 00:13:01.414
Jake Gyllenhaal
also totally nailed

00:13:01.448 --> 00:13:04.317
his turn as Mysterio
in Far From Home.

00:13:04.351 --> 00:13:06.119
At first you're like,

00:13:06.153 --> 00:13:08.822
"Aw. What an amazing mentor
and friend he is."

00:13:08.856 --> 00:13:12.525
And the next thing you know, he's ordering
a drone strike on you and your friends.

00:13:12.559 --> 00:13:14.627
Oh, It happened. I was there.

00:13:14.661 --> 00:13:16.663
Kill that witch!

00:13:16.696 --> 00:13:20.300
I love the idea of putting a
bunch of rogue villains together

00:13:20.333 --> 00:13:22.970
and just watching them meet each
other and hang out and talk.

00:13:23.003 --> 00:13:25.605
You know I can give you
a real makeover.

00:13:25.638 --> 00:13:27.040
Let me guess, into a lizard?

00:13:27.074 --> 00:13:28.208
Exactly.

00:13:28.241 --> 00:13:29.676
Would you two just shut up?

00:13:29.709 --> 00:13:31.444
I've never really seen that.

00:13:31.478 --> 00:13:35.282
I don't think any of the actors
were coming for a cameo.

00:13:35.315 --> 00:13:39.953
I think that they were all
coming to tell another chapter

00:13:39.987 --> 00:13:42.155
of their characters' story.

00:13:42.189 --> 00:13:43.790
You want to play games?

00:13:43.823 --> 00:13:45.959
You can't get better
than Alfred Molina as Doc Ock.

00:13:45.993 --> 00:13:49.496
If you were ever gonna bring Doc Ock
back, it would have to be Alfred Molina.

00:13:49.529 --> 00:13:52.465
And we realized that,
thanks to the MCU,

00:13:52.499 --> 00:13:54.001
there's a way to do that.

00:13:54.034 --> 00:13:55.635
And that's what
No Way Home is doing...

00:13:55.668 --> 00:13:57.470
Paying honor,
in a very direct way,

00:13:57.504 --> 00:13:59.639
to the Spidey films
that have come before.

00:13:59.672 --> 00:14:01.750
I think I can say this
for all of us, we're all fans.

00:14:01.774 --> 00:14:04.011
And it's a wonderful world
to be in.

00:14:04.044 --> 00:14:06.213
And if I say so myself,
we're having a lot of fun.

00:14:08.882 --> 00:14:12.052
The wonderful thing
about working on these movies

00:14:12.085 --> 00:14:16.256
is that we have been working
with unparalleled actors.

00:14:16.289 --> 00:14:18.892
I mean, actors are everything.

00:14:18.926 --> 00:14:21.594
We live in an amazing time
in history, people,

00:14:21.628 --> 00:14:23.663
where we've been gifted not one,

00:14:23.696 --> 00:14:27.234
but two Mary Jane Watsons
in our lives.

00:14:27.267 --> 00:14:29.236
The always charming
Kirsten Dunst

00:14:29.269 --> 00:14:30.703
played her
in the initial trilogy,

00:14:30.737 --> 00:14:32.539
providing us with
a wonderful performance

00:14:32.572 --> 00:14:34.942
and perhaps one of
the most iconic screen kisses

00:14:34.975 --> 00:14:36.043
of all time.

00:14:42.282 --> 00:14:45.752
Yeah, man, I like my movie kisses
wet and hanging upside down.

00:14:45.785 --> 00:14:47.554
Okay.

00:14:47.587 --> 00:14:50.890
Our costar Zendaya would
eventually take the MJ mantle

00:14:50.924 --> 00:14:52.392
in the most recent films,

00:14:52.425 --> 00:14:54.427
bringing a very funny,
more modern spin.

00:14:54.461 --> 00:14:56.964
I don't wanna celebrate something
that was built by slaves.

00:14:56.997 --> 00:14:59.399
Oh, I'm sure the Washington
Monument wasn't built by...

00:15:01.334 --> 00:15:02.635
Okay. Enjoy your book.

00:15:06.273 --> 00:15:08.475
Think I wanna be done now!

00:15:08.508 --> 00:15:11.320
- But we never got to see the kiss again.
- Never, never doing that again.

00:15:11.344 --> 00:15:12.679
Well, I don't know about that.

00:15:16.783 --> 00:15:19.953
We also had two Gwen Stacys
make it into the films.

00:15:19.987 --> 00:15:23.756
First, Bryce Dallas Howard appeared
in the role in Spider-Man 3.

00:15:23.790 --> 00:15:26.230
But it was the Emma Stone version
from The Amazing Spider-Man 2

00:15:26.259 --> 00:15:29.162
that met with the same fate
as her comic book counterpart.

00:15:30.497 --> 00:15:32.399
You can't be here right now.
This is insane!

00:15:32.432 --> 00:15:35.135
Okay, guess what! This is my choice.
This is mine.

00:15:35.168 --> 00:15:37.237
And what Spider-Man story
would be complete

00:15:37.270 --> 00:15:39.106
without mentioning Aunt May?

00:15:39.139 --> 00:15:41.608
- What's going on in there?
- Peter's beloved mother figure.

00:15:41.641 --> 00:15:44.077
First, we had
the great Rosemary Harris

00:15:44.111 --> 00:15:47.014
playing a quintessential
white-haired version of Aunt May.

00:15:47.047 --> 00:15:49.649
Then they went out
and got Sally Field.

00:15:49.682 --> 00:15:52.019
- A legend.
- Phew!

00:15:52.052 --> 00:15:53.820
Absolutely, a legend.

00:15:53.853 --> 00:15:56.099
And then in our films, we get
the incredible Marisa Tomei...

00:15:56.123 --> 00:15:57.790
Oh, my...

00:15:57.824 --> 00:16:00.293
who flipped my perception
of the character on its head.

00:16:00.327 --> 00:16:02.329
She really was
kind of like my aunt.

00:16:02.362 --> 00:16:05.365
And we have this kind of familial
connection to each other.

00:16:05.398 --> 00:16:07.300
That was great.

00:16:07.334 --> 00:16:09.112
And no discussion of Spider-Man's
supporting characters

00:16:09.136 --> 00:16:11.271
would be complete
without talking about

00:16:11.304 --> 00:16:13.140
J.K. Simmons'
inspired performance

00:16:13.173 --> 00:16:14.607
as J. Jonah Jameson,

00:16:14.641 --> 00:16:16.476
editor-in-chief
of the Daily Bugle

00:16:16.509 --> 00:16:19.346
and the ultimate
Spider-Man troll.

00:16:19.379 --> 00:16:20.680
Spider-Man troll.

00:16:20.713 --> 00:16:23.116
I didn't try to
base him on anything

00:16:23.150 --> 00:16:25.052
other than my take on
the comic books.

00:16:25.085 --> 00:16:27.654
And then it was just
roll the camera and bark.

00:16:28.555 --> 00:16:29.856
Could you pay me in advance?

00:16:34.361 --> 00:16:36.396
You serious?

00:16:36.429 --> 00:16:39.966
J.K.'s performance was so damn
good in the original trilogy

00:16:39.999 --> 00:16:42.369
that they didn't even bother
recasting the character

00:16:42.402 --> 00:16:44.671
when he shows up at the end
of Far From Home,

00:16:44.704 --> 00:16:48.208
'cause who wants to live
in that flattop's shadow?

00:16:48.241 --> 00:16:49.709
There you have it, folks:

00:16:49.742 --> 00:16:52.479
Conclusive proof
that Spider-Man was responsible

00:16:52.512 --> 00:16:54.747
for the brutal murder
of Mysterio.

00:16:54.781 --> 00:16:56.849
What a great time
to be a Spider-Man fan.

00:16:56.883 --> 00:16:59.086
- That's right, folks.
- Whoo-whee!

00:16:59.119 --> 00:17:01.188
"Spider-Man: Hero or Menace"?

00:17:02.222 --> 00:17:03.723
Three, two, one.

00:17:03.756 --> 00:17:05.024
Here we go.

00:17:05.058 --> 00:17:06.693
Behind every
successful superhero film

00:17:06.726 --> 00:17:08.195
is a great director.

00:17:08.228 --> 00:17:10.930
And each of these
Spider-Man film series

00:17:10.963 --> 00:17:14.534
have boasted a trio of
talented filmmakers at the helm.

00:17:14.567 --> 00:17:17.237
Director Sam Raimi
got first crack

00:17:17.270 --> 00:17:20.840
at bringing everybody's
favorite wall crawler to life.

00:17:20.873 --> 00:17:22.475
Ready, and action.

00:17:26.579 --> 00:17:30.350
I love Sam Raimi. As a young filmmaker,
you're seeing someone do something

00:17:30.383 --> 00:17:32.619
that is so entertaining
and so full of life

00:17:32.652 --> 00:17:34.354
and comedy and energy.

00:17:34.387 --> 00:17:36.123
Then you feel like
you could do that too.

00:17:36.156 --> 00:17:38.125
- How'd you do that?
- Work out.

00:17:38.158 --> 00:17:40.227
You know,
eat your green vegetables.

00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:42.862
He won me over with his vision,
like, instantly.

00:17:44.131 --> 00:17:45.465
Schools closed down

00:17:45.498 --> 00:17:47.267
so people could
go see that movie.

00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:50.403
You know, nobody had ever seen
Spider-Man swinging before.

00:17:50.437 --> 00:17:52.205
Obviously,
there's a lot of humor.

00:17:52.239 --> 00:17:55.742
Sam loves to just
torture his characters.

00:17:55.775 --> 00:17:58.044
Cut it now. Good.

00:17:58.077 --> 00:17:59.312
That was good.

00:18:00.980 --> 00:18:02.949
And then came Marc Webb.

00:18:02.982 --> 00:18:05.485
Already a successful
music video director,

00:18:05.518 --> 00:18:08.988
Webb was handed the keys to
The Amazing Spider-Man series.

00:18:09.021 --> 00:18:12.425
I love those movies,
and I thought that Marc Webb

00:18:12.459 --> 00:18:15.662
had such great human talent.

00:18:15.695 --> 00:18:19.098
And then when
we cast Andrew and Emma,

00:18:19.132 --> 00:18:21.434
I think he did
a brilliant job with them.

00:18:21.468 --> 00:18:23.002
Good.

00:18:23.035 --> 00:18:24.837
Webb reimagined
his Spider-M story

00:18:24.871 --> 00:18:26.639
from the ground up,

00:18:26.673 --> 00:18:29.142
surrounding Peter Parker with
an award-winning supporting cast

00:18:29.176 --> 00:18:30.843
and then thrilling audiences

00:18:30.877 --> 00:18:34.013
by putting them right in
the thick of the action.

00:18:35.282 --> 00:18:37.417
Marc is very, very generous,

00:18:37.450 --> 00:18:40.520
and he's a really creative,
exciting director.

00:18:40.553 --> 00:18:42.155
Action!

00:18:42.189 --> 00:18:44.257
Next, we arrive

00:18:44.291 --> 00:18:48.094
- at our esteemed colleague, Mr. Jon Watts.
- Yep, yep.

00:18:48.127 --> 00:18:50.430
Director of the three
most recent Spider-Man films,

00:18:50.463 --> 00:18:52.765
Homecoming, Far From Home

00:18:52.799 --> 00:18:55.668
and the third installment,
No Way Home, baby.

00:18:55.702 --> 00:18:57.870
Seeing him grow
through Homecoming

00:18:57.904 --> 00:19:00.173
and then Far From Home,
and now with No Way Home,

00:19:00.207 --> 00:19:03.710
which is by far the most ambitious
Spider-Man film ever made,

00:19:03.743 --> 00:19:06.546
seeing how he's grown into
that role is really amazing.

00:19:06.579 --> 00:19:09.282
Jon Watts has done
such a wonderful job

00:19:09.316 --> 00:19:12.519
of creating this genre
of superhero movie

00:19:12.552 --> 00:19:14.787
that kind of
hasn't been told before.

00:19:14.821 --> 00:19:17.824
- Jon is amazing.
- The weight of this film, he carries it so lightly.

00:19:17.857 --> 00:19:18.858
Great. Cut.

00:19:18.891 --> 00:19:20.893
Yeah!

00:19:20.927 --> 00:19:23.663
His ability to combine humor,
humanity and spectacular action

00:19:23.696 --> 00:19:26.733
has helped propel the recent
films to all-new heights.

00:19:26.766 --> 00:19:29.001
Going up!

00:19:29.035 --> 00:19:31.475
It's not like they are these
little stand-alone stories either.

00:19:31.504 --> 00:19:34.841
They also have to honor
the bigger MCU story lines

00:19:34.874 --> 00:19:36.643
going on in the background too.

00:19:36.676 --> 00:19:39.212
I can't believe I'm
in the Sanctum Sanctorum.

00:19:39.246 --> 00:19:40.380
Neither can I.

00:19:40.413 --> 00:19:41.914
- Give me the box.
- No.

00:19:41.948 --> 00:19:44.150
Jon Watts, he has this thing

00:19:44.183 --> 00:19:46.419
where he'll say "one more"
for every take,

00:19:46.453 --> 00:19:48.087
and then you'll do
20 more takes.

00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:49.522
- One more.
- One more.

00:19:49.556 --> 00:19:51.358
- One more.
- One, one, one, one more.

00:19:51.391 --> 00:19:53.660
One more means one more
when you're on 22.

00:19:53.693 --> 00:19:55.728
Are you sure it's one more?

00:19:55.762 --> 00:19:58.431
Every time I say that now, I'm gonna
get in trouble. Not in trouble.

00:19:58.465 --> 00:20:00.367
Put a dollar in the "one more" jar?
Yeah.

00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:01.640
Got it. Moving on.
Just kidding.

00:20:10.443 --> 00:20:13.780
- Spidey has hops. I could do that in my younger days.
- I believe you.

00:20:13.813 --> 00:20:16.916
Each film series
has taken its own stab

00:20:16.949 --> 00:20:19.286
at adapting Spidey's
unique powers for film,

00:20:19.319 --> 00:20:22.689
resulting in some of
the craziest action and stunts

00:20:22.722 --> 00:20:24.391
you're ever gonna see,

00:20:24.424 --> 00:20:28.461
requiring the lead actors
to dive headlong into training,

00:20:28.495 --> 00:20:31.964
fight choreography
and lots and lots of wirework.

00:20:32.899 --> 00:20:34.401
In the original trilogy,

00:20:34.434 --> 00:20:38.305
the VFX team blended
large-scale practical effects

00:20:38.338 --> 00:20:40.807
with state-of-the-art
digital effects from the time

00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:43.075
to give audiences
their first glimpse

00:20:43.109 --> 00:20:45.912
at web swinging
on the big screen.

00:20:46.513 --> 00:20:47.847
It also holds up too.

00:20:48.781 --> 00:20:50.550
And nowhere is that
more apparent

00:20:50.583 --> 00:20:54.253
than in the absurdly cool
subway scene from Spider-Man 2.

00:21:01.928 --> 00:21:03.896
You know, back in my day,

00:21:03.930 --> 00:21:05.932
I had to do
a lot more practically.

00:21:05.965 --> 00:21:08.901
And it's just a lot easier now

00:21:08.935 --> 00:21:11.471
with what
technology's able to do.

00:21:11.504 --> 00:21:14.741
Three, two, one, action!

00:21:14.774 --> 00:21:17.977
Ten years later, digital effects
had advanced to the point

00:21:18.010 --> 00:21:21.147
where Marc Webb and his VFX team

00:21:21.180 --> 00:21:24.751
were able to drop you
right into Spider-Man's POV

00:21:24.784 --> 00:21:26.018
in The Amazing Spider-Man

00:21:26.052 --> 00:21:28.287
for an even more
immersive thrill ride

00:21:28.321 --> 00:21:29.689
through the streets
of Manhattan.

00:21:29.722 --> 00:21:31.157
All right. Good. And cut.

00:21:31.190 --> 00:21:33.826
I thought about
the nature of Spider-Man

00:21:33.860 --> 00:21:36.963
and how important it was
for us to reinvent

00:21:36.996 --> 00:21:39.198
the language of Spider-Man.

00:21:39.231 --> 00:21:41.601
What have you got
for me today, New York?

00:21:41.634 --> 00:21:43.636
But then, Homecoming gave us

00:21:43.670 --> 00:21:45.772
that incredible
ferry disaster sequence...

00:21:45.805 --> 00:21:49.476
which gets one-upped by Spidey's
epic midair battle with the Vulture

00:21:49.509 --> 00:21:52.011
on the surface
of a stealth plane.

00:21:52.044 --> 00:21:53.179
Absolutely incredible.

00:21:53.212 --> 00:21:54.313
Safety first.

00:21:54.347 --> 00:21:55.848
Then in Far From Home,

00:21:55.882 --> 00:21:58.184
we get treated to
these massive Elemental battles,

00:21:58.217 --> 00:22:01.053
but they turn out to be
just an appetizer.

00:22:04.023 --> 00:22:07.226
And what about that
sick Mysterio illusion sequence

00:22:07.259 --> 00:22:10.830
where he brings all of Peter
Parker's inner fears to life?

00:22:10.863 --> 00:22:13.366
Zombie Tony Stark
about to eat his brain!

00:22:14.667 --> 00:22:17.069
And then wham!
He gets taken out by the Eurail.

00:22:17.103 --> 00:22:19.238
You hated to see it,
but it had to happen.

00:22:19.271 --> 00:22:22.642
It blew my mind and made me
question reality myself.

00:22:22.675 --> 00:22:24.353
This is Peter Parker,
this is Peter Parker.

00:22:24.377 --> 00:22:25.645
Spider-Man, Spider-Man.

00:22:25.678 --> 00:22:26.855
They're mes
from other universes.

00:22:26.879 --> 00:22:28.214
No, no.
They're here to help.

00:22:28.247 --> 00:22:30.349
This is the wizard
I was telling you about.

00:22:30.383 --> 00:22:32.485
From a choreography
standpoint, it's interesting

00:22:32.519 --> 00:22:35.187
because Spider-Man's never
fought with Spider-Man before.

00:22:35.221 --> 00:22:37.056
And I think what
we want to try and explore

00:22:37.089 --> 00:22:39.426
is an element of us trying
to figure each other out

00:22:39.459 --> 00:22:42.094
and figure out our each
individual, unique styles

00:22:42.128 --> 00:22:43.763
of how to be Spider-Man.

00:22:43.796 --> 00:22:45.774
And the amazing thing about
working with Marvel and Sony

00:22:45.798 --> 00:22:48.234
is that the sky's the limit
with these films.

00:22:48.267 --> 00:22:50.102
There's no idea
that's too crazy,

00:22:50.136 --> 00:22:53.039
so if you want to do
a quadruple backflip

00:22:53.072 --> 00:22:55.542
over an electric zap
or something,

00:22:55.575 --> 00:22:57.043
that can happen.

00:22:57.076 --> 00:22:59.345
So, it's so fun
being able to just sit down,

00:22:59.378 --> 00:23:00.913
play with the stunt team

00:23:00.947 --> 00:23:02.791
and figure out how
we're going to make this film

00:23:02.815 --> 00:23:04.951
bigger and better
than anything before.

00:23:07.053 --> 00:23:09.088
No, I really think
you should have a disguise.

00:23:09.121 --> 00:23:12.124
An effective one,
but also one that's funny.

00:23:15.294 --> 00:23:18.565
The Spider-Man costume is
probably, with no exaggeration,

00:23:18.598 --> 00:23:21.200
one of the best
graphic design elements

00:23:21.233 --> 00:23:23.302
in the history
of graphic design.

00:23:23.335 --> 00:23:25.071
So, are you gonna go into battle

00:23:25.104 --> 00:23:26.573
dressed as a cool youth pastor,

00:23:26.606 --> 00:23:28.174
or do you got your suit?

00:23:29.476 --> 00:23:32.244
We were talking about
the idea of how cool it is

00:23:32.278 --> 00:23:33.980
to wear the Spider-Man suit.

00:23:34.013 --> 00:23:37.083
But in reality, it takes three
people and five shoehorns

00:23:37.116 --> 00:23:40.620
and a lot of talcum powder
and oil and, like, 45 minutes...

00:23:40.653 --> 00:23:42.088
Are you still
using talcum powder?

00:23:42.121 --> 00:23:44.290
I'm still on the talc.
The secret is...

00:23:44.323 --> 00:23:46.793
- Go on.
- I'll tell you the secret later.

00:23:46.826 --> 00:23:48.495
We'll catch up.
I figured it out.

00:23:48.528 --> 00:23:51.397
Can I just go back to the trick
about putting on the suit?

00:23:51.430 --> 00:23:53.833
'Cause this is practical stuff
that I want to know.

00:23:53.866 --> 00:23:56.936
So, we have these plastic bags
that I put over my feet.

00:23:56.969 --> 00:23:58.337
Ah, slippery.

00:23:58.370 --> 00:23:59.815
And then they slide right in.
Slide in.

00:23:59.839 --> 00:24:02.675
The only thing is,
you get mad sweaty feet.

00:24:02.709 --> 00:24:03.876
Tell me more about that.

00:24:07.313 --> 00:24:11.017
The Spidey suits you see in the
movies are significantly better

00:24:11.050 --> 00:24:13.953
than the footy pajama versions
I like to wear.

00:24:13.986 --> 00:24:16.489
Or-Or-Or I used to wear.

00:24:16.523 --> 00:24:19.091
Anyway, we thought it would
be fun to take a look back

00:24:19.125 --> 00:24:20.860
at all the different
Spider-Man suits

00:24:20.893 --> 00:24:22.361
that have graced the big screen.

00:24:23.896 --> 00:24:25.598
Man, it's crazy!

00:24:25.632 --> 00:24:27.500
What else can this suit do?

00:24:28.568 --> 00:24:30.069
What?

00:24:31.904 --> 00:24:35.207
First though, we got Tobey
Maguire's red hoodie number

00:24:35.241 --> 00:24:37.109
from the original
Spider-Man film.

00:24:37.143 --> 00:24:39.183
- You got my name wrong...
- Get out there, you moron!

00:24:39.211 --> 00:24:42.114
Looks kind of like Banksy
if he shopped at Marshalls.

00:24:42.148 --> 00:24:44.350
Spidey's gotta
adjust his glasses.

00:24:44.383 --> 00:24:47.153
Tobey then gets an upgrade with
an iconic red-and-blue suit

00:24:47.186 --> 00:24:49.989
that will last
the entire first trilogy.

00:24:50.022 --> 00:24:53.025
Although it barely made it through
an entire movie in one piece.

00:24:53.059 --> 00:24:57.129
And no need for web shooters
cluttering up that drip.

00:24:57.163 --> 00:24:59.532
My man Tobey had
organic web shooters,

00:24:59.566 --> 00:25:02.501
which is kinda nasty
when you think about it.

00:25:05.004 --> 00:25:06.839
But it's also super cool.

00:25:06.873 --> 00:25:08.913
It's kind of like having
a runny nose in your wrist.

00:25:11.177 --> 00:25:13.145
Later, in Spider-Man 3,

00:25:13.179 --> 00:25:15.381
you got a taste of
the legendary black suit...

00:25:15.414 --> 00:25:16.883
- from the comic books.
- Wow.

00:25:16.916 --> 00:25:18.651
For formal occasions, of course.

00:25:18.685 --> 00:25:20.920
Sometimes he might throw
a bow tie on it. I don't know.

00:25:20.953 --> 00:25:23.590
Then came The Amazing Spider-Man,
which debuted a new suit look

00:25:23.623 --> 00:25:26.025
with a more serious tone.

00:25:26.058 --> 00:25:28.527
This is the costume.
This is the outfit.

00:25:28.561 --> 00:25:30.529
It's different. I mean,
we're changing things up.

00:25:30.563 --> 00:25:32.932
Subdued colors, buggier eyes

00:25:32.965 --> 00:25:37.570
and Spider-Man's traditional
mechanical web shooters on the wrists.

00:25:37.604 --> 00:25:40.206
A second suit dropped
in The Amazing Spider-Man 2,

00:25:40.239 --> 00:25:42.508
brightening the colors,
widening the eyes

00:25:42.541 --> 00:25:46.012
and adopting more of Spidey's
classic comic book look.

00:25:46.045 --> 00:25:48.347
Those eyes, which are big,
they're really...

00:25:48.380 --> 00:25:52.384
Those big, expressive,
kind, friendly, white eyes

00:25:52.418 --> 00:25:53.853
that are such an important part

00:25:53.886 --> 00:25:55.755
of how people interact
with Spider-Man

00:25:55.788 --> 00:25:57.757
and why they love Spider-Man.

00:25:59.125 --> 00:26:00.627
A minor upgrade?

00:26:02.061 --> 00:26:04.797
Whoa! Oh, my God!

00:26:04.831 --> 00:26:06.599
Put it on.

00:26:06.633 --> 00:26:08.367
Tom Holland's
first suit was introduced

00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:11.137
when the character debuted
in Captain America: Civil War.

00:26:11.170 --> 00:26:14.874
It was a sleek, modern nod
to the classic Spidey look.

00:26:14.907 --> 00:26:16.442
Plus, it came with web shooters

00:26:16.475 --> 00:26:20.446
and also enhanced with
all kinds of crazy Stark tech.

00:26:20.479 --> 00:26:21.948
In Homecoming,

00:26:21.981 --> 00:26:25.117
Tom also dons his nifty
homemade prototype suit.

00:26:25.151 --> 00:26:26.919
What the hell are you wearing?

00:26:26.953 --> 00:26:28.330
Then we get to Tom's
tricked-out Iron Spider look

00:26:28.354 --> 00:26:30.122
in Infinity Wa and Endgame,

00:26:30.156 --> 00:26:32.224
with those shiny,
golden spider legs

00:26:32.258 --> 00:26:34.493
flying every which way.

00:26:34.526 --> 00:26:37.797
After that, Far From Home
introduced another all-black outfit,

00:26:37.830 --> 00:26:39.666
aka the Night Monkey.

00:26:39.699 --> 00:26:41.433
- Whoo!
- How's the suit?

00:26:41.467 --> 00:26:43.145
It's a little tight
around the old web-shooter.

00:26:43.169 --> 00:26:44.737
Parker!
Okay, I'll shut up.

00:26:44.771 --> 00:26:46.639
Later in the film, Peter designs

00:26:46.673 --> 00:26:48.474
an all-new suit
with Stark tech...

00:26:48.507 --> 00:26:49.942
Okay.

00:26:49.976 --> 00:26:52.511
Resulting
in the first-of-its-kind

00:26:52.544 --> 00:26:54.346
red-and-black variation.

00:26:54.380 --> 00:26:57.817
With all these suits,
I can't wait to see what's next.

00:26:57.850 --> 00:27:00.219
You think your fancy
new suit's gonna save you?

00:27:03.455 --> 00:27:06.258
The thing
I'm proudest of is the fact

00:27:06.292 --> 00:27:11.130
that people of all ages
seem to love Spider-Man.

00:27:11.163 --> 00:27:14.133
Take a quick look back
at all of Stan's cameos

00:27:14.166 --> 00:27:16.502
from all the Spider-Man films.

00:27:16.535 --> 00:27:19.706
Stan Lee.
Gone, but never forgotten.

00:27:19.739 --> 00:27:21.007
Excelsior.

00:27:26.545 --> 00:27:28.347
Look out!

00:27:29.982 --> 00:27:32.685
Hey! Shut that off!

00:27:32.719 --> 00:27:34.286
I was... Tell him it's my car!

00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:37.123
Don't make me
come down there, you punk!

00:27:37.156 --> 00:27:39.959
Hey, Gary! How ya doing?

00:27:39.992 --> 00:27:41.327
Marjorie, how are you?

00:27:50.870 --> 00:27:52.538
Hey, I think I know that guy.

00:27:55.507 --> 00:27:59.712
You know, I guess one person
can make a difference.

00:28:02.014 --> 00:28:03.049
Nuff said.

00:28:04.283 --> 00:28:07.319
Doing this show, Martin,
one thing becomes pretty clear.

00:28:07.353 --> 00:28:08.420
What's that?

00:28:08.454 --> 00:28:09.856
When it comes to superheroes,

00:28:09.889 --> 00:28:11.991
Spider-Man is king.
Okay.

00:28:12.024 --> 00:28:13.826
We've got three versions,
eight films,

00:28:13.860 --> 00:28:15.427
countless box office records.

00:28:15.461 --> 00:28:16.863
The fact that this one character

00:28:16.896 --> 00:28:18.931
is capable of that much
success for so long

00:28:18.965 --> 00:28:20.532
is a testament to the appeal

00:28:20.566 --> 00:28:22.134
of Stan Lee
and Steve Ditko's creation.

00:28:23.970 --> 00:28:26.072
But we ain't done, Martin.
We're not?

00:28:26.105 --> 00:28:28.741
No. Even though every
Spider-Man film series

00:28:28.775 --> 00:28:31.210
has taken the character
down a different road,

00:28:31.243 --> 00:28:34.346
now all these roads
lead to one place.

00:28:34.380 --> 00:28:36.220
- Hmm. Where's that?
- Spider-Man: No Way Home.

00:28:36.248 --> 00:28:39.952
The culmination of two decades
worth of hard work, creativity

00:28:39.986 --> 00:28:42.621
and some intense gymnastics.

00:28:42.654 --> 00:28:44.857
- Dude!
- Dude!

00:28:44.891 --> 00:28:46.192
Dude!

00:28:47.426 --> 00:28:49.461
- You ready?
- I'm ready.

00:28:49.495 --> 00:28:52.899
I don't know about you, man,
but my juices are flowing.

00:28:52.932 --> 00:28:54.433
Yeah, right there
with you, buddy.

00:28:54.466 --> 00:28:56.068
We hope that you enjoyed

00:28:56.102 --> 00:28:58.570
this trip down Spider-Man
movie memory lane

00:28:58.604 --> 00:29:00.739
as much as we enjoyed
putting this thing together

00:29:00.773 --> 00:29:02.909
with the help of some
very talented people.

00:29:04.110 --> 00:29:06.645
It's all effort
and personal sacrifice.

00:29:06.678 --> 00:29:09.415
With great power
comes great responsibility.

00:29:09.448 --> 00:29:11.317
You're now locked and loaded

00:29:11.350 --> 00:29:13.319
for Spider-Man: No Way Home.

00:29:13.352 --> 00:29:15.721
You can thank us later.
You're welcome.

00:29:15.754 --> 00:29:18.457
Do it for yourself,
but also do it for us,

00:29:18.490 --> 00:29:21.427
after all we've been through
this last half an hour.

00:29:21.460 --> 00:29:25.131
Plus, Daddy's STARmeter
needs some boost.

00:29:25.164 --> 00:29:27.633
Spidey fans, look the guy up.

00:29:28.500 --> 00:29:29.936
He's J.B. Smoove.

00:29:29.969 --> 00:29:31.503
And this guy here
is Martin Starr.

00:29:31.537 --> 00:29:32.604
Thanks for watching.

00:29:35.174 --> 00:29:37.209
What are you spraying?
What are you doing?

00:29:40.646 --> 00:29:41.881
We lost him.
