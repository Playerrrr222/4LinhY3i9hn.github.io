1
00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:38.572
2009 NFL season is underway.

2
00:00:38.672 --> 00:00:40.908
The Cleveland Browns
host the Miami Dolphins.

3
00:00:41.008 --> 00:00:42.510
Heisman Trophy winner
and first-round draft pick

4
00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:45.246
Bobby Coleman is
in as running back.

5
00:00:45.346 --> 00:00:46.714
Handoff, Coleman.

6
00:00:46.814 --> 00:00:49.517
Oh, and Coleman,
right off the bat, fumbles it...

7
00:00:49.617 --> 00:00:51.619
That's my dad,
Bobby Coleman.

8
00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.388
Not how anyone expected
his career to start.

9
00:00:54.488 --> 00:00:55.489
Might have been
his first fumble,

10
00:00:55.589 --> 00:00:58.058
but it wasn't his last.

11
00:00:58.159 --> 00:01:01.529
Because of that, I ended up
moving around...a lot.

12
00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:04.265
I turned six in Indianapolis.

13
00:01:04.365 --> 00:01:05.833
Eight was in Chicago.

14
00:01:05.933 --> 00:01:07.301
Bobby Coleman coughs up the ball

15
00:01:07.401 --> 00:01:09.737
for the Bears, and
the Raiders recover.

16
00:01:09.837 --> 00:01:11.905
Then we were on to
Jacksonville for my tenth,

17
00:01:12.005 --> 00:01:14.642
but you can probably
guess what happened.

18
00:01:14.742 --> 00:01:16.510
And then
the football comes loose.

19
00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:18.912
The big 1-3
was in Minneapolis.

20
00:01:19.012 --> 00:01:20.481
I wasn't there long
enough to make friends,

21
00:01:20.581 --> 00:01:23.751
but I did perfect my
Madden skills.

22
00:01:23.851 --> 00:01:25.553
Twelve years after
that first fumble,

23
00:01:25.653 --> 00:01:27.521
we ended up in Atlanta.

24
00:01:27.621 --> 00:01:29.690
What I didn't know was,
I was about to have

25
00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.725
the weirdest year of my life.

26
00:01:33.194 --> 00:01:35.563
As the Falcons
close out the preseason,

27
00:01:35.663 --> 00:01:38.599
the big question really is,
will Bobby Coleman--

28
00:01:38.699 --> 00:01:41.535
Keisha, why are
you watching that?

29
00:01:41.635 --> 00:01:44.272
Come on.
Don't listen to 'em.

30
00:01:44.372 --> 00:01:45.606
Listen to me.

31
00:01:45.706 --> 00:01:46.840
They don't know what
they're talking about.

32
00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:47.975
Well, I hope so,

33
00:01:48.075 --> 00:01:49.910
because we've already
moved so many times,

34
00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:51.145
and it's a lot!

35
00:01:51.245 --> 00:01:52.280
Look, I don't like picking up

36
00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:53.781
and shuffling to
a new city either.

37
00:01:53.881 --> 00:01:54.882
I know one thing--

38
00:01:54.982 --> 00:01:56.083
if Anderson Fisher
wasn't on the team,

39
00:01:56.184 --> 00:01:57.518
I'd definitely make the roster.

40
00:01:57.618 --> 00:01:58.886
No, you need to stop
worrying about everyone else

41
00:01:58.986 --> 00:02:01.489
and maybe start thinking about
what life might look like

42
00:02:01.589 --> 00:02:02.923
-after football.
-Whoa, whoa, whoa.

43
00:02:03.023 --> 00:02:05.593
Did you just use those words
I think I heard you say?

44
00:02:05.693 --> 00:02:07.395
Coaches seen me put in
the work this preseason.

45
00:02:07.495 --> 00:02:08.829
Come on, baby.

46
00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:10.498
I've been killing myself
to be ready for this season,

47
00:02:10.598 --> 00:02:12.233
and you think I'm done.
But I'm just getting started.

48
00:02:12.333 --> 00:02:13.501
No, baby, that's
not what I said.

49
00:02:13.601 --> 00:02:15.769
But I can't take another trade.

50
00:02:15.869 --> 00:02:17.538
So that better be
look at this house,

51
00:02:17.638 --> 00:02:21.342
fall in love with it.
We can grow old here.

52
00:02:21.442 --> 00:02:23.110
-Okay.
-Okay.

53
00:02:24.978 --> 00:02:27.047
Second
and twelve, versus Coleman.

54
00:02:27.147 --> 00:02:28.516
And back to the Lions.

55
00:02:28.616 --> 00:02:31.885
And he'll play four
at the 27-yard line.

56
00:02:31.985 --> 00:02:33.053
Whoa!

57
00:02:33.153 --> 00:02:36.557
Callie, jeez!
Not cool.

58
00:02:36.657 --> 00:02:37.691
Girl, that's my move.

59
00:02:37.791 --> 00:02:39.860
I saw you in the reflection.

60
00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:41.462
-You did?
-Mm-hmm.

61
00:02:41.562 --> 00:02:42.763
You really gotta
step up your game.

62
00:02:42.863 --> 00:02:44.432
-I guess so.
- Yeah.

63
00:02:44.532 --> 00:02:46.600
-So no more cinnamon rolls.
-What do you mean?

64
00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:47.801
If you wanna make the roster,

65
00:02:47.901 --> 00:02:49.470
you gotta be at
peak physical condition.

66
00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:51.004
Oh, come on, Callie, it's
the last day of preseason!

67
00:02:51.104 --> 00:02:52.039
Uh-uh, no buts.

68
00:02:52.139 --> 00:02:53.507
Look, we've been
down this road before.

69
00:02:53.607 --> 00:02:55.209
First it's cinnamon rolls.

70
00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:56.610
Then late-night Cap'n Crunch.

71
00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:58.879
Then I find you hoarding
Oreos under the bathroom sink.

72
00:02:58.979 --> 00:03:00.981
Cookies taste so much
better when it's secret.

73
00:03:01.081 --> 00:03:02.750
It's not very hygienic.

74
00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:04.017
Everybody got their vices.

75
00:03:04.117 --> 00:03:05.253
-I'm just saying!

76
00:03:05.353 --> 00:03:07.020
You sit in here all day
and you play video games.

77
00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.422
Am I wrong?

78
00:03:08.522 --> 00:03:10.123
No, that's why I have
a high OBR in Madden.

79
00:03:10.224 --> 00:03:11.925
You know what I was doing
when I was your age?

80
00:03:12.025 --> 00:03:14.094
Oh, when
I was your age, I used to...

81
00:03:14.194 --> 00:03:17.365
-go outside.

82
00:03:17.465 --> 00:03:18.699
Just saying, it wouldn't
hurt to get out there

83
00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:21.235
and make a few friends.
You know?

84
00:03:21.335 --> 00:03:23.671
I know it hasn't been easy,
all this moving around.

85
00:03:23.771 --> 00:03:25.172
You mean it's not
every girl's dream

86
00:03:25.273 --> 00:03:26.507
to skip town every two years

87
00:03:26.607 --> 00:03:29.009
like her family's a bunch
of wanted bank robbers?

88
00:03:29.109 --> 00:03:30.811
-A fair hit.
-Mm-hmm.

89
00:03:30.911 --> 00:03:32.980
But I feel different
about Atlanta, baby girl.

90
00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:36.149
I'm telling you, I think
we gonna be here for a while.

91
00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:39.287
Yeah, I've heard
that one before.

92
00:03:39.387 --> 00:03:41.822
But it would be nice

93
00:03:41.922 --> 00:03:44.492
to finally
call a city home for once.

94
00:03:48.362 --> 00:03:50.230
-Guess what?
-Hmm?

95
00:03:50.331 --> 00:03:52.700
I couldn't agree more.

96
00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:56.304
I don't wanna keep being
the reason we move.

97
00:03:56.404 --> 00:03:58.005
Good.

98
00:03:58.105 --> 00:04:00.007
-Oh, can I show you something?
-Of course.

99
00:04:00.107 --> 00:04:03.377
Okay, so I've been working
on some predictive analytics

100
00:04:03.477 --> 00:04:05.112
to help prepare you
for your first game.

101
00:04:05.212 --> 00:04:07.348
Okay, I have no idea what that
is, but I love the sound of it.

102
00:04:07.448 --> 00:04:09.717
All right, so basically, it
all comes down to 0's and 1's.

103
00:04:09.817 --> 00:04:11.084
-Okay.
-I catalogued

104
00:04:11.184 --> 00:04:12.986
all the Falcons styles
from the past season.

105
00:04:13.086 --> 00:04:15.456
They're efficient, they get a 1.
Non-efficient, they get a 0.

106
00:04:15.556 --> 00:04:17.691
So I loaded that data
into this spreadsheet

107
00:04:17.791 --> 00:04:20.294
and coded an algorithm in
Python that can predict...

108
00:04:20.394 --> 00:04:23.263
-What?

109
00:04:23.364 --> 00:04:26.467
Just--I'm just so proud of you.
You and your numbers.

110
00:04:26.567 --> 00:04:29.770
-You just keep getting smarter.
-Are you--are you listening?

111
00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:31.739
-Yes, Daughter, I'm listening.
-Okay, so...

112
00:04:31.839 --> 00:04:33.407
Time for school!

113
00:04:36.043 --> 00:04:37.845
* Ha, ha, ha
Get it, get it *

114
00:04:37.945 --> 00:04:39.680
* I got the bag,
I'm runnin' with it *

115
00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:41.482
* This one's rippin'
Hit the curb like it's ready *

116
00:04:41.582 --> 00:04:42.816
* Get it, get it

117
00:04:42.916 --> 00:04:44.452
* I got the car,
there's no limit *

118
00:04:44.552 --> 00:04:45.753
...pass to the
end zone.

119
00:04:45.853 --> 00:04:47.488
But oh my goodness!

120
00:04:47.588 --> 00:04:49.490
Last minute,
Coleman decides to lateral

121
00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:52.793
to All-Star Anderson Fisher!
Whoo!

122
00:04:52.893 --> 00:04:54.695
No, no, no, no,
whoo-ah, none of that.

123
00:04:54.795 --> 00:04:57.064
Time out. I'm not even
pretending to pass the ball to

124
00:04:57.164 --> 00:04:58.165
All-Star Anderson Fisher.

125
00:04:58.265 --> 00:04:59.867
And you, I see
you're trying to be slick.

126
00:04:59.967 --> 00:05:01.902
You're not about to drive, no.

127
00:05:02.002 --> 00:05:03.404
You only had your
license three weeks.

128
00:05:03.504 --> 00:05:05.939
I'm not trying to
have a panic attack.

129
00:05:06.039 --> 00:05:07.074
All right, fine.

130
00:05:07.174 --> 00:05:09.309
But I do get to play
my Spotify on the way.

131
00:05:11.178 --> 00:05:12.480
* Get it, get it

132
00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:13.847
* I got the card,
there's no limit *

133
00:05:13.947 --> 00:05:15.383
* In demand now,
going now by the minute *

134
00:05:15.483 --> 00:05:16.617
* Get it, get it

135
00:05:16.717 --> 00:05:18.652
* We get it, we get it

136
00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:22.289
Here
we go, let's have some fun.

137
00:05:25.325 --> 00:05:27.795
Anyone else feel the
breeze from that wiff?

138
00:05:27.895 --> 00:05:29.296
It's okay, you got this.

139
00:05:29.397 --> 00:05:31.399
- You're doing great.
-They are always like this.

140
00:05:31.499 --> 00:05:32.833
Bunch of jerks.

141
00:05:32.933 --> 00:05:34.835
Ugh, I wish someone
would teach them a lesson.

142
00:05:34.935 --> 00:05:35.936
For real.

143
00:05:38.839 --> 00:05:41.108
Is there a
remedial gym class, maybe?

144
00:05:43.411 --> 00:05:45.613
Here we go!
Here's the pitch!

145
00:05:49.049 --> 00:05:50.751
Put her
out of her misery!

146
00:05:50.851 --> 00:05:52.586
She's gonna break
home plate with her butt.

147
00:05:52.686 --> 00:05:54.321
Remember,
eye on the ball.

148
00:05:54.422 --> 00:05:55.989
Gonna get this.

149
00:05:56.089 --> 00:05:58.492
You're actually gonna try again?

150
00:06:03.431 --> 00:06:06.366
No extra
charge for the cold showers!

151
00:06:10.471 --> 00:06:12.239
Bobby, you've
been a real workhorse for us

152
00:06:12.339 --> 00:06:14.408
this preseason.

153
00:06:14.508 --> 00:06:18.311
We've been impressed by
your hustle and determination.

154
00:06:18.412 --> 00:06:20.681
And that's why we wanna keep
you right here in the lineup.

155
00:06:20.781 --> 00:06:22.382
Yes! I knew it, Coach.

156
00:06:22.483 --> 00:06:26.219
-But on the practice squad.
-Okay.

157
00:06:26.319 --> 00:06:29.590
Listen, you're a hard worker
and a veteran leader,

158
00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:31.825
an ideal locker room guy for us.

159
00:06:31.925 --> 00:06:34.094
Right, right.
I mean, I love the locker room.

160
00:06:34.194 --> 00:06:36.029
And great water pressure
in the shower, by the way.

161
00:06:36.129 --> 00:06:37.130
I mean, wow.

162
00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:39.933
But just as an idea,
Coach, you know...

163
00:06:40.033 --> 00:06:42.636
wouldn't it be better if that
hard work and veteran leadership

164
00:06:42.736 --> 00:06:45.873
you speak about was being
used on the field, right?

165
00:06:45.973 --> 00:06:49.577
Out there, not...in there.
You know?

166
00:06:49.677 --> 00:06:51.078
All right, listen, Bobby.

167
00:06:51.178 --> 00:06:54.948
And, uh, don't take this
the wrong way, but...

168
00:06:55.048 --> 00:06:57.785
your Heisman days
are far behind you.

169
00:06:57.885 --> 00:06:59.953
And with the league
trending past firsts,

170
00:07:00.053 --> 00:07:02.422
we're just gonna keep
two backs active.

171
00:07:02.523 --> 00:07:04.492
So, we've got Allen,

172
00:07:04.592 --> 00:07:06.760
and obviously
Anderson's a no-brainer.

173
00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:08.562
Ha, ha!
Are you kidding me, Coach?

174
00:07:08.662 --> 00:07:10.330
I mean, the guy's a phenom.

175
00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:12.500
He is, he is.

176
00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:14.935
Well, thank you,
Coach, you know?

177
00:07:15.035 --> 00:07:16.537
For giving it to me
straight, you know?

178
00:07:16.637 --> 00:07:18.472
With no chaser.
I can appreciate that.

179
00:07:18.572 --> 00:07:19.907
I knew you'd take the news well.

180
00:07:22.075 --> 00:07:26.379
Baby, I need you to
take a deep breath.

181
00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:29.416
I know it hurts, but
it's just temporary.

182
00:07:29.517 --> 00:07:30.684
And so what?

183
00:07:30.784 --> 00:07:32.085
Anderson Fisher
had one great year.

184
00:07:32.185 --> 00:07:34.154
It's not like it makes him
the face of the Falcons.

185
00:07:39.893 --> 00:07:41.328
Baby, are
you gonna be okay?

186
00:07:41.428 --> 00:07:42.796
Yeah.

187
00:07:42.896 --> 00:07:44.131
'Cause I don't want
you crashing the car

188
00:07:44.231 --> 00:07:45.566
'cause you can't see the
road through your tears.

189
00:07:45.666 --> 00:07:46.867
Yo!

190
00:07:46.967 --> 00:07:49.903
Keish, I gotta go, okay?
I'll see ya.

191
00:07:51.839 --> 00:07:54.274
-Yo, yo, yo.
-Hey, Anderson, what's up, man?

192
00:07:54.374 --> 00:07:56.243
-You see that banner up there?
-Oh yeah.

193
00:07:56.343 --> 00:07:58.245
It's a big me!

194
00:07:58.345 --> 00:08:00.113
-Look how big I am, dog!
-I know, huh.

195
00:08:00.213 --> 00:08:01.515
Yo, you
know, maybe next time,

196
00:08:01.615 --> 00:08:03.817
I'll be posing for the
wax museum version of myself.

197
00:08:03.917 --> 00:08:05.519
What stance do you
think I should do?

198
00:08:05.619 --> 00:08:07.020
-That's cool.
-Hold up, hold up.

199
00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:08.889
-Yeah, that's cool.
-Are you all right?

200
00:08:08.989 --> 00:08:12.259
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

201
00:08:12.359 --> 00:08:15.362
Oh, man, there's just
allergies, you know?

202
00:08:15.462 --> 00:08:17.698
It must be pollinating the
whole parking lot, though.

203
00:08:17.798 --> 00:08:19.232
-What?
-Yeah, yeah.

204
00:08:19.332 --> 00:08:20.634
-Word.
-Yeah, word.

205
00:08:20.734 --> 00:08:23.336
-Who?
-You know...

206
00:08:23.436 --> 00:08:25.606
bees.

207
00:08:25.706 --> 00:08:27.207
-Bzzz?
-Bees.

208
00:08:27.307 --> 00:08:28.441
Bzzz.

209
00:08:30.410 --> 00:08:33.113
Right. Listen, man,

210
00:08:33.213 --> 00:08:34.948
crying ain't nothin'
to be ashamed of.

211
00:08:35.048 --> 00:08:37.585
Embrace your feelings.
You wanna hug it out?

212
00:08:37.685 --> 00:08:39.452
No.

213
00:08:39.553 --> 00:08:40.821
I'm a good hugger, right?

214
00:08:40.921 --> 00:08:42.022
-It's tight.
-Yeah--

215
00:08:42.122 --> 00:08:43.423
But it's not too
tight, all right?

216
00:08:43.523 --> 00:08:45.325
You can feel safe and secure
in these arms, I promise.

217
00:08:45.425 --> 00:08:47.327
I hear you.
Maybe next time, all right?

218
00:08:47.427 --> 00:08:48.428
-Done?
-Yep, that's it.

219
00:08:48.528 --> 00:08:49.897
I wanted to remind you about

220
00:08:49.997 --> 00:08:52.232
my end of preseason
party at my crib, right?

221
00:08:52.332 --> 00:08:54.334
You and the whole
family is invited.

222
00:08:54.434 --> 00:08:56.469
I want everyone to get the whole
Anderson Fisher experience.

223
00:08:56.570 --> 00:08:58.405
Well, I'm not too sure,
you know, what we got going on

224
00:08:58.505 --> 00:09:00.073
or whatever, but I'll
check with the wife.

225
00:09:00.173 --> 00:09:02.075
You don't wanna miss out
on these finger foods.

226
00:09:02.175 --> 00:09:03.944
Oh, you just gonna
roll that down, huh?

227
00:09:04.044 --> 00:09:06.647
I'm talking deconstructed
carnival fare, all right?

228
00:09:06.747 --> 00:09:08.215
-But listen, Sniffles.
-Hm?

229
00:09:08.315 --> 00:09:09.783
Go get some
24-hour relief, man.

230
00:09:09.883 --> 00:09:11.151
-Hey, cloud that up.
-Uh-huh.

231
00:09:11.251 --> 00:09:12.886
-Suck it up, dry it out.
-Yeah, dry it out.

232
00:09:12.986 --> 00:09:15.623
- You got it, baby.
-All right, man. Yeah.

233
00:09:19.693 --> 00:09:22.830
Hey, new girl!
Wait up!

234
00:09:22.930 --> 00:09:25.766
It's Callie, right?

235
00:09:25.866 --> 00:09:29.703
Uh, yeah, that's
actually my name, yeah.

236
00:09:29.803 --> 00:09:33.473
I'm Kayla.
And this is Zoe and Margo.

237
00:09:33.573 --> 00:09:37.144
We just had to ask.
How did you pull that off?

238
00:09:37.244 --> 00:09:38.812
I didn't--
I didn't do anything.

239
00:09:38.912 --> 00:09:40.113
Right, right.

240
00:09:40.213 --> 00:09:41.649
Yeah, no, I'm gonna
need every single detail

241
00:09:41.749 --> 00:09:43.250
of what just what down.

242
00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:46.787
So, we were talking,
and we were wondering, um,

243
00:09:46.887 --> 00:09:49.422
if--if, you know--if--
it's up to you--

244
00:09:49.522 --> 00:09:51.124
If you feel like it would
be in your best interest--

245
00:09:51.224 --> 00:09:53.627
-We're on a robotics team.
- Yeah.

246
00:09:53.727 --> 00:09:55.929
Robotics?

247
00:09:56.029 --> 00:09:57.931
Like, you guys build robots?

248
00:09:58.031 --> 00:09:59.800
Yep! I'm team captain.

249
00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:02.202
We meet on Tuesdays
and Thursdays at 4:30.

250
00:10:02.302 --> 00:10:05.172
And based off of
what we saw today--

251
00:10:05.272 --> 00:10:09.142
that thing that you
definitely didn't do--

252
00:10:09.242 --> 00:10:14.414
well, whoever did do that
might wanna come check us out.

253
00:10:14.514 --> 00:10:16.416
Okay. Yeah, yeah, cool.

254
00:10:16.516 --> 00:10:20.453
I mean, um, whoever did
that would probably say

255
00:10:20.553 --> 00:10:24.491
thanks for the invite and,
uh, they'll think about it.

256
00:10:24.591 --> 00:10:26.526
Awesome, yeah. Thanks.

257
00:10:31.999 --> 00:10:33.500
* Hey, hey, hey

258
00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:35.869

00:10:35.969 --> 00:10:38.005

00:10:43.076 --> 00:10:44.978
* Yeah, we gonna celebrate

263
00:10:45.078 --> 00:10:47.280
* Keep it goin',

264
00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:49.649
* Uh, we give the good energy

265
00:10:49.750 --> 00:10:52.019
* Hey, hey, hey, hey

266
00:10:52.119 --> 00:10:54.221
* Everybody got their hands up

267
00:10:54.321 --> 00:10:56.489
* Ain't no room on the
world for a dancer *

268
00:10:56.589 --> 00:10:58.658
* If they ain't here, go
ahead and call your fans up *

269
00:10:58.759 --> 00:11:01.094
* Then telegram to tell them
to bring a camera 'cause *

270
00:11:01.194 --> 00:11:03.163
* We about to burn it down

271
00:11:04.597 --> 00:11:05.833
Bobby Coleman!

272
00:11:05.933 --> 00:11:07.267
Hey, hey.

273
00:11:09.803 --> 00:11:11.171
What's up?
How are you doin'?

274
00:11:11.271 --> 00:11:13.206
Hey, you let me know if this
music too loud, all right?

275
00:11:13.306 --> 00:11:15.776
This must be Callie
and the beautiful Keisha.

276
00:11:15.876 --> 00:11:17.477
Cheeseburger on a stick?
Beef and cheddar

277
00:11:17.577 --> 00:11:19.980
tucked in a hash brown ball,
fried golden brown.

278
00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:22.182
-Sounds delicious.
-Yes, please.

279
00:11:22.282 --> 00:11:24.451
You see, they got good taste.

280
00:11:24.551 --> 00:11:27.187
Welcome to my wonderland!

281
00:11:27.287 --> 00:11:29.923
Custom built by the same
guy who did three of

282
00:11:30.023 --> 00:11:31.992
Robert Downey Jr's six houses.

283
00:11:32.092 --> 00:11:33.226
I have to show you
my home theater.

284
00:11:33.326 --> 00:11:34.494
Oh no, man,
we're cool right here.

285
00:11:34.594 --> 00:11:35.863
It just got installed.

286
00:11:35.963 --> 00:11:37.297
Guys in there playing
Madden right now.

287
00:11:37.397 --> 00:11:40.300
I should warn you, Callie,
she's mean on that Madden.

288
00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:42.235
-Takes no prisoners.
-Oh yeah?

289
00:11:42.335 --> 00:11:44.071
She must be playing as me.

290
00:11:44.171 --> 00:11:46.006
You know I got the
overall 100 rating, right?

291
00:11:46.106 --> 00:11:49.109
-You know, AF keep it 100!
-Yeah.

292
00:11:49.209 --> 00:11:51.611
Except nobody's got a
perfect 100 rating in Madden .

293
00:11:51.711 --> 00:11:53.480
Uh, Dad, he actually does.

294
00:11:53.580 --> 00:11:55.048
Yeah, they're saying
I'm the first one.

295
00:11:55.148 --> 00:11:56.984
You know, pioneer
and all of that.

296
00:11:57.084 --> 00:11:58.986
You know, create
milestones and all of that.

297
00:11:59.086 --> 00:12:00.320
Uh, what about you?

298
00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:02.022
What's, uh...
What's your rating?

299
00:12:02.122 --> 00:12:04.491
-72?
-He's a 67.

300
00:12:04.591 --> 00:12:05.525
Dang!

301
00:12:05.625 --> 00:12:08.361
I mean, that's tough.

302
00:12:08.461 --> 00:12:10.030
Well, you know,
at least on Madden,

303
00:12:10.130 --> 00:12:11.531
you're not stuck
in a locker room.

304
00:12:11.631 --> 00:12:13.767
You're actually on
the field with me.

305
00:12:13.867 --> 00:12:17.938
Behold, the home theater!

306
00:12:18.038 --> 00:12:20.841
Hey, yo, listen up!
This is Callie Coleman.

307
00:12:20.941 --> 00:12:23.243
She got next, all right?
Go easy on her.

308
00:12:23.343 --> 00:12:25.012
More like I'll go easy on them.

309
00:12:25.112 --> 00:12:27.380
Whoa!

310
00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:29.116
Let me show you how
it works at the crib.

311
00:12:29.216 --> 00:12:31.351
So yeah, you know, the floors
are imported zebra wood.

312
00:12:31.451 --> 00:12:33.686
You look up, ceiling,
white marble.

313
00:12:33.787 --> 00:12:37.057
I said, whatever they gave
Michelangelo, give me that.

314
00:12:37.157 --> 00:12:38.525
That's me.

315
00:12:40.227 --> 00:12:42.029
It's a little
embarrassing, uh...

316
00:12:42.129 --> 00:12:43.263
So they made some
bobbleheads of me.

317
00:12:43.363 --> 00:12:45.866
I got a couple
advance copies.

318
00:12:45.966 --> 00:12:47.334
So yeah, that's
my knitting room.

319
00:12:47.434 --> 00:12:48.701
Uh, a lot of people
don't know this,

320
00:12:48.802 --> 00:12:51.138
but I'm actually really
good at making mittens.

321
00:12:55.242 --> 00:12:59.112
This is my rookie year
single-season rushing record.

322
00:12:59.212 --> 00:13:01.214
Had to put it somewhere.

323
00:13:01.314 --> 00:13:04.284
You know, Anderson, pride is
one of the seven deadly sins.

324
00:13:04.384 --> 00:13:07.320
Yeah, well, so is gluttony,
but that ain't stop you.

325
00:13:07.420 --> 00:13:08.889
No, just
messing with you, man.

326
00:13:08.989 --> 00:13:10.757
It's probably 'cause
the shirt's small.

327
00:13:10.858 --> 00:13:12.425
You know, I'll be
honest with you.

328
00:13:12.525 --> 00:13:14.327
I actually thought
this rushing record

329
00:13:14.427 --> 00:13:16.263
was gonna be yours the
year you won the Heisman.

330
00:13:16.363 --> 00:13:17.530
-Word?
-Yeah, man.

331
00:13:17.630 --> 00:13:20.033
-You were my favorite player.
-Yeah?

332
00:13:20.133 --> 00:13:21.969
Yeah, don't doubt, man.
We all loved you.

333
00:13:22.069 --> 00:13:23.770
The whole fifth grade.

334
00:13:23.871 --> 00:13:26.073
Yo, let me get those
deconstructed cotton candies!

335
00:13:26.173 --> 00:13:27.707
-I'll get one too.
- Yo, hold up!

336
00:13:33.746 --> 00:13:34.882
Whoo!

337
00:13:34.982 --> 00:13:36.616
I warned you I was
an expert in that.

338
00:13:36.716 --> 00:13:39.519
Did this girl invent the game?
How did you get this good?

339
00:13:39.619 --> 00:13:41.922
I think the real question
is how did you get so bad?

340
00:13:42.022 --> 00:13:44.057
Whoa!

341
00:13:44.157 --> 00:13:45.825
It's all right.
Maybe next time, man.

342
00:13:45.926 --> 00:13:47.160
Everyone say bye!

343
00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:49.129
- Bye!
-Bye.

344
00:13:49.229 --> 00:13:50.563
Have a good one.

345
00:13:52.332 --> 00:13:55.969
All right, um, who's next?
Anybody else?

346
00:13:56.069 --> 00:13:58.105
-Uh, uh, all right.
-Yo, Anderson?

347
00:13:58.205 --> 00:13:59.739
I think it's only,
you know, fair

348
00:13:59.839 --> 00:14:02.442
that the man who owns
the home "the-a-ta"

349
00:14:02.542 --> 00:14:04.811
takes a turn.
What you say?

350
00:14:08.348 --> 00:14:10.217
All right, cool, cool,
let's get it, let's get it.

351
00:14:10.317 --> 00:14:12.485
Let's see what
you got, Lil Coleman.

352
00:14:14.254 --> 00:14:16.756
* This is the beginnin'
of the new world, baby *

353
00:14:16.856 --> 00:14:19.326
Whoa!

354
00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:22.029
Get him, Callie!

355
00:14:22.129 --> 00:14:23.663
Button's stuck, man!

356
00:14:23.763 --> 00:14:24.898
* Superman did it

357
00:14:24.998 --> 00:14:26.166
* Passion of a G

358
00:14:26.266 --> 00:14:27.667
* Sittin' like a soldier

359
00:14:32.572 --> 00:14:34.141
No, no, no, no!
I pressed--

360
00:14:34.241 --> 00:14:35.408
Hey, yo, come on.

361
00:14:35.508 --> 00:14:36.910
My control--
I was lagging, man.

362
00:14:37.010 --> 00:14:38.378
That's tough.

363
00:14:38.478 --> 00:14:40.247
Is it rude for me to
clown the host at the party?

364
00:14:40.347 --> 00:14:41.314
Or should I--

365
00:14:42.950 --> 00:14:45.318
Hey. Are you gonna let her
fight all your battles or...

366
00:14:45.418 --> 00:14:46.853
you gonna come play me yourself?

367
00:14:50.257 --> 00:14:51.691
I got no problem with it.

368
00:14:51.791 --> 00:14:53.893
Long as you don't mind getting
beat by two Colemans in one day.

369
00:14:58.065 --> 00:15:00.000
Okay, chill out,
chill out, chill out.

370
00:15:00.100 --> 00:15:01.768
You know what?
Since Bobby Coleman here

371
00:15:01.868 --> 00:15:04.004
has seniority, right?

372
00:15:04.104 --> 00:15:07.407
A lot of seniority.
He don't look old.

373
00:15:07.507 --> 00:15:10.243
I'ma let you play
as me, Anderson Fisher.

374
00:15:10.343 --> 00:15:11.811
Man, shut up.
I ain't gonna play as you.

375
00:15:11.911 --> 00:15:13.346
I'm gonna play as Bobby Coleman.

376
00:15:13.446 --> 00:15:15.315
And I'm gonna school ya.

377
00:15:24.057 --> 00:15:26.293
Hey, Dad.
You gotta admit.

378
00:15:26.393 --> 00:15:28.861
It's kind of funny
that you lost by 86 points.

379
00:15:28.962 --> 00:15:30.430
I mean, I've never seen it.

380
00:15:30.530 --> 00:15:32.199
Well, look, I-I
don't find the humor.

381
00:15:32.299 --> 00:15:34.601
And a man humiliated me
in front of all my peers.

382
00:15:34.701 --> 00:15:36.703
That was a direct attack
on my entire person.

383
00:15:36.803 --> 00:15:40.107
-Oh! Your entire person?
-Yes, Keisha.

384
00:15:40.207 --> 00:15:41.474
That was an attack
on my manhood.

385
00:15:41.574 --> 00:15:43.043
And I'm supposed to
just sit there and laugh

386
00:15:43.143 --> 00:15:44.144
like it's some kind of game?
Nuh-uh.

387
00:15:44.244 --> 00:15:47.547
It's literally a video game!

388
00:15:47.647 --> 00:15:49.782
Isn't that right,
Bobblehead Anderson?

389
00:15:49.882 --> 00:15:51.451
Um,
that is correct, Keisha.

390
00:15:51.551 --> 00:15:53.520
Keisha, he gave you that
and you didn't burn it?

391
00:15:53.620 --> 00:15:55.555
Never say no to
a swag bag, baby.

392
00:15:55.655 --> 00:15:57.057
-Wait, wait!
-He's comin'.

393
00:15:57.157 --> 00:15:58.858
Uh, uh! Uh, uh!

394
00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:02.062
You better get some
ice for this sore loser!

395
00:16:03.396 --> 00:16:06.133
Poor guy's only a 67,
and mad.

396
00:16:06.233 --> 00:16:08.635
Ha, ha, ha, ha, yeah, okay.
Just laugh, huh?

397
00:16:08.735 --> 00:16:10.837
-Oh, that's how it's gonna be.

398
00:16:10.937 --> 00:16:12.039
Hang you up.

399
00:16:12.139 --> 00:16:14.174
Make fun of Bobby.
Make fun.

400
00:16:14.274 --> 00:16:16.376
Bobby Coleman,
everybody laughing.

401
00:16:16.476 --> 00:16:20.047
-Don't, babe.
-Anderson is not so bad.

402
00:16:20.147 --> 00:16:22.182
He gave me a copy of his Madden .

403
00:16:22.282 --> 00:16:23.350
-He gave you what?
- He signed it.

404
00:16:23.450 --> 00:16:25.152
And he signed it?

405
00:16:25.252 --> 00:16:27.354
But--no, stop!

406
00:16:27.454 --> 00:16:29.522
I'm not lookin' at the road.
I'm about to pull over.

407
00:16:29.622 --> 00:16:31.524
Give me the game.
Bobby, give me the game.

408
00:16:32.492 --> 00:16:33.693
Y'all
have gone crazy

409
00:16:33.793 --> 00:16:35.462
if you think I'm
bringing this to my house.

410
00:16:35.562 --> 00:16:37.864
This game is not
coming into my house!

411
00:16:37.964 --> 00:16:38.965
Throwing it out!

412
00:16:39.066 --> 00:16:42.235
What? What?
No!

413
00:16:42.335 --> 00:16:44.204
-Wait, wait.
-Throwing it away.

414
00:16:44.304 --> 00:16:46.139
-Dad! Seriously?
-Yes, seriously!

415
00:16:46.239 --> 00:16:47.340
No, it's just a game!

416
00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:48.575
-No, it's more than a game.
-Stop!

417
00:16:48.675 --> 00:16:49.942
-What are you doing?
-What is wrong with you?

418
00:16:50.043 --> 00:16:52.279
-We were just joking!
-Don't you get it, Keish?

419
00:16:52.379 --> 00:16:54.481
That man has the life
we were supposed to have.

420
00:16:54.581 --> 00:16:57.050
Had I broken that rushing record
and gotten that big contract,

421
00:16:57.150 --> 00:16:58.285
that would be our house!

422
00:16:58.385 --> 00:16:59.586
No, but instead,
I've been dragging you

423
00:16:59.686 --> 00:17:02.289
all around the country for what?
Huh?

424
00:17:02.389 --> 00:17:04.224
Bobby's a big disappointment!
I'm a joke!

425
00:17:04.324 --> 00:17:06.059
I got no endorsement deals!

426
00:17:06.159 --> 00:17:07.760
I'm not even in
the conversation!

427
00:17:07.860 --> 00:17:09.229
It should've been us!

428
00:17:11.464 --> 00:17:12.899
What the...

429
00:17:15.735 --> 00:17:17.337
Are y'all okay!?

430
00:17:17.437 --> 00:17:19.439
Callie! Callie, look at me!

431
00:17:20.307 --> 00:17:23.009
Am I, am I, am I, am I alive?

432
00:17:23.110 --> 00:17:24.111
I'm alive!

433
00:17:24.211 --> 00:17:26.479
-Can you hear me?
-Is she alive?

434
00:17:26.579 --> 00:17:28.281
You okay? You okay?

435
00:17:28.381 --> 00:17:30.617
Yeah, I'm actually--
I'm actually fine.

436
00:17:30.717 --> 00:17:33.486
Thank God. That was crazy!

437
00:17:33.586 --> 00:17:35.422
What is wrong with you two?

438
00:17:35.522 --> 00:17:36.889
We could be in the ER right now.

439
00:17:36.989 --> 00:17:38.958
Don't you have anything
to say to each other?

440
00:17:39.058 --> 00:17:40.460
Well, Bobby?

441
00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:42.395
-What? She started it!
-She started it!?

442
00:17:42.495 --> 00:17:46.466
Baby, you are a grown man.

443
00:17:46.566 --> 00:17:49.169
My bad for making fun of
your rating in Madden .

444
00:17:49.269 --> 00:17:51.304
I'm sorry.

445
00:17:51.404 --> 00:17:55.975
My bad for losing my temper.
I'm sorry.

446
00:17:56.075 --> 00:17:58.878
Well, I'm gonna have to
see a hug or something.

447
00:18:02.315 --> 00:18:04.083
Like, you mean it!

448
00:18:13.826 --> 00:18:15.762
-Sorry.
-All right, let's get inside.

449
00:18:18.831 --> 00:18:20.133
Wait.

450
00:18:22.535 --> 00:18:24.070
Come on, baby,
it's raining so hard!

451
00:18:24.171 --> 00:18:25.638
Come on, let's go!

452
00:18:25.738 --> 00:18:27.907
It's still perfect.

453
00:18:42.822 --> 00:18:44.123
Come on!

454
00:18:44.224 --> 00:18:45.658
Let's go!
Let's go!

455
00:18:48.161 --> 00:18:50.797
Whoo! Ha, ha, ha.

456
00:18:50.897 --> 00:18:52.098
All right,
Chris, one more time!

457
00:18:52.199 --> 00:18:53.800
Hey, man.
You know, at your age,

458
00:18:53.900 --> 00:18:55.702
it's not even about
finishing first.

459
00:18:55.802 --> 00:18:57.304
It's about finishing at all.

460
00:18:57.404 --> 00:18:59.539
We are all proud of you.

461
00:18:59.639 --> 00:19:01.874
You know, it's like watching
an old dog go up some stairs.

462
00:19:01.974 --> 00:19:03.243
Like, you don't
think he'll make it,

463
00:19:03.343 --> 00:19:04.777
but somehow the little
rascal digs deep?

464
00:19:04.877 --> 00:19:06.646
That's you, man!
You're digging deep!

465
00:19:06.746 --> 00:19:07.880
Starters!
You guys take a break.

466
00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:10.650
Practice squad,
let's run some formations.

467
00:19:21.794 --> 00:19:23.863
EA Sports--
It's in the game.

468
00:19:23.963 --> 00:19:27.367
Let's go, Madden!

469
00:19:27.467 --> 00:19:30.203
Let's go, Madden!

470
00:19:30.303 --> 00:19:32.339
Let's get that rating up.

471
00:19:43.816 --> 00:19:46.018
* Got your best friend
hanging out the arm door *

472
00:19:46.118 --> 00:19:48.255
* You got game like I'm
droppin' me a console *

473
00:19:48.355 --> 00:19:50.523
* No, I don't swim,
but I give a long stroke *

474
00:19:50.623 --> 00:19:51.924
* Can I flex

475
00:19:52.024 --> 00:19:53.726
* While you're
giving me the best *

476
00:19:53.826 --> 00:19:55.662
* Get up in your gets
while I soak up my success *

477
00:19:55.762 --> 00:19:56.829
* Gettin' tokens
for your stress *

478
00:19:56.929 --> 00:19:58.431
* I'll be making
all the checks *

479
00:19:58.531 --> 00:20:00.600
* Any time you see me
step on the stage *

480
00:20:02.235 --> 00:20:04.237
-Woo!
-Yeah!

481
00:20:04.337 --> 00:20:05.572
Yeah, Bobby!

482
00:20:05.672 --> 00:20:07.507
Somebody ate their
Wheaties today, boy!

483
00:20:07.607 --> 00:20:08.675
Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

484
00:20:08.775 --> 00:20:10.543
I like that!
I like that!

485
00:20:10.643 --> 00:20:11.844
I've never seen
him do that before.

486
00:20:11.944 --> 00:20:13.112
Never.

487
00:20:17.850 --> 00:20:21.153
* Everything has gotta be
cool when we livin' some fun *

488
00:20:21.254 --> 00:20:22.555
* Feel it in your bones

489
00:20:22.655 --> 00:20:25.224
* You ain't gonna
feel it 'til I'm done *

490
00:20:25.325 --> 00:20:27.727
* 'Caught up in your
feelin's like you're froze *

491
00:20:27.827 --> 00:20:30.763
* And everything around
you gettin' cold *

492
00:20:32.732 --> 00:20:34.734
* Caught up in my
feelings, now I'm froze *

493
00:20:34.834 --> 00:20:36.135
Yeah!

494
00:20:38.004 --> 00:20:42.208
Old dog teaching the young
pup new things out here today!

495
00:20:42.309 --> 00:20:44.811
-That's luck.
-Bobby?

496
00:20:44.911 --> 00:20:47.914
Let's have a chat in my office.

497
00:20:48.014 --> 00:20:49.081
Hey, yo.

498
00:20:49.181 --> 00:20:50.350
Yes sir, Coach!

499
00:20:51.518 --> 00:20:53.320
Callie! Hey!

500
00:20:53.420 --> 00:20:57.156
We have been talking about
that sprinkler stunt non stop!

501
00:20:57.256 --> 00:20:58.458
-Really?
-Yeah.

502
00:20:58.558 --> 00:21:00.393
Well, I mean, it
wasn't that impressive.

503
00:21:00.493 --> 00:21:02.028
Smart and humble.

504
00:21:02.128 --> 00:21:03.830
I'm gonna need you to be
a little cockier, though,

505
00:21:03.930 --> 00:21:06.766
like stand firm in your
power and abilities, yeah?

506
00:21:08.835 --> 00:21:11.438
That's Oliver.
He's a little reserved.

507
00:21:11.538 --> 00:21:14.741
Doesn't talk, really.

508
00:21:14.841 --> 00:21:18.244
More of a...supportive
head nod guy.

509
00:21:18.345 --> 00:21:20.480
Right, Oliver?

510
00:21:20.580 --> 00:21:21.814
I know, I know, sorry I'm late.

511
00:21:21.914 --> 00:21:25.017
I didn't--oh, whoa.
Hey.

512
00:21:25.117 --> 00:21:26.519
Hi.

513
00:21:26.619 --> 00:21:28.087
Look, sorry for running
into you and all that.

514
00:21:28.187 --> 00:21:29.689
-You good?
-Yeah.

515
00:21:29.789 --> 00:21:32.392
I'm Nate. Nathaniel.

516
00:21:32.492 --> 00:21:35.928
But you can just call me Nate.
Everybody else calls me that.

517
00:21:36.028 --> 00:21:37.163
Okay!

518
00:21:37.263 --> 00:21:39.599
So, Callie, you wanna see
our robot from last year?

519
00:21:39.699 --> 00:21:41.200
Sure.

520
00:21:48.741 --> 00:21:50.377
Definitely more
heart than function.

521
00:21:50.477 --> 00:21:51.744
Yeah.

522
00:21:51.844 --> 00:21:53.480
But now that we got
the LeBron of robotics,

523
00:21:53.580 --> 00:21:54.914
we goin' all the way.

524
00:21:55.014 --> 00:21:57.617
Yeah, that's, uh...
That's a lot of pressure.

525
00:21:57.717 --> 00:21:59.952
No, just all of our hopes
and dreams on our shoulders.

526
00:22:00.052 --> 00:22:03.155
Light work.

527
00:22:06.793 --> 00:22:09.161
Oh, um, I got to take this.
Sorry, guys.

528
00:22:09.261 --> 00:22:10.196
Yeah.

529
00:22:10.296 --> 00:22:11.631
Hey, Dad. What's up?

530
00:22:11.731 --> 00:22:13.533
Kind of busy with
school right now.

531
00:22:13.633 --> 00:22:15.402
Well, come home.
We're celebrating!

532
00:22:15.502 --> 00:22:16.969
That's right, your daddy
got moved up to the roster.

533
00:22:17.069 --> 00:22:18.638
No more practice squad!
Ha, ha!

534
00:22:18.738 --> 00:22:21.474
Okay, I'll...
I'll see you soon.

535
00:22:21.574 --> 00:22:23.309
* Hey, feeling good

536
00:22:23.410 --> 00:22:25.678
So Rodney comes at me
from the right, babe, right?

537
00:22:25.778 --> 00:22:28.748
And I'm--I'm like, nope.

538
00:22:29.816 --> 00:22:32.552
So then I juke left,
kind of like this.

539
00:22:32.652 --> 00:22:34.654
Whoo! He don't have
a chance, right?

540
00:22:34.754 --> 00:22:36.055
So then I get it on--

541
00:22:40.059 --> 00:22:43.195
Wait--I mean, you get the idea.

542
00:22:43.295 --> 00:22:44.397
Yes.

543
00:22:44.497 --> 00:22:45.865
You know what?

544
00:22:45.965 --> 00:22:47.434
I think the assistant coach
got some on the video.

545
00:22:47.534 --> 00:22:49.068
-So, I'll be right back.
-Okay.

546
00:22:50.670 --> 00:22:52.539
So, how was robotics?

547
00:22:52.639 --> 00:22:54.907
Everybody seems to be
pretty cool so far.

548
00:22:55.007 --> 00:22:57.644
I mean, that's great!
No offense to your dad, but...

549
00:22:57.744 --> 00:22:59.278
you definitely get
your brains from me.

550
00:22:59.378 --> 00:23:00.480
Okay!

551
00:23:00.580 --> 00:23:03.315
Check it out!
Look at this, huh?

552
00:23:03.416 --> 00:23:05.418
-What!?
-How cool is that?

553
00:23:05.518 --> 00:23:07.286
-50-yard punt return.
-Oh, oh--

554
00:23:07.386 --> 00:23:09.956
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
I gotta fast forward.

555
00:23:10.056 --> 00:23:12.725
-Look at that, huh?
-Oh my gosh!

556
00:23:12.825 --> 00:23:14.927
Dive and catch?

557
00:23:16.929 --> 00:23:19.398
I'm so proud of you!

558
00:23:19.499 --> 00:23:20.800
Thank you.

559
00:23:20.900 --> 00:23:22.368
I recorded my
game so I can show you how

560
00:23:22.469 --> 00:23:26.539
I'm improving your rating,
but...look at this.

561
00:23:26.639 --> 00:23:30.209
These plays are exactly the same
as what you did in practice.

562
00:23:30.309 --> 00:23:31.678
-Whoa.
-Yeah.

563
00:23:31.778 --> 00:23:33.813
I mean, you know, it was better
in real life, though, because

564
00:23:33.913 --> 00:23:35.882
everything I did, you can
see Anderson Fisher's face.

565
00:23:35.982 --> 00:23:40.587
Every move I make,
he was like, wha?

566
00:23:40.687 --> 00:23:41.754
Jukin' left and right?

567
00:23:41.854 --> 00:23:43.823
Oh, baby girl, I can't sleep.

568
00:23:44.824 --> 00:23:47.460
Maybe the lightning somehow...

569
00:23:47.560 --> 00:23:50.763
No, no, no.

570
00:23:50.863 --> 00:23:53.132
I don't know.
It's just, like...

571
00:23:53.232 --> 00:23:55.234
real you was doing the exact
same thing fake you was doing

572
00:23:55.334 --> 00:23:57.770
at the same time
real you was doing it.

573
00:23:57.870 --> 00:23:59.972
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
What are you mumbling about?

574
00:24:00.072 --> 00:24:04.844
I...I don't know.
No, that's insane!

575
00:24:04.944 --> 00:24:08.214
Video games can't
affect real life.

576
00:24:08.314 --> 00:24:10.282
Unless they can.

577
00:24:10.382 --> 00:24:12.051
Then it's like...

578
00:24:14.120 --> 00:24:15.655
Whoa.

579
00:24:17.690 --> 00:24:19.025
I think we need to
run an experiment.

580
00:24:19.125 --> 00:24:20.693
-Say what?
-Your first game.

581
00:24:20.793 --> 00:24:22.629
What if I played
as you in Madden ?

582
00:24:22.729 --> 00:24:24.497
When that lightning hit,
it changed something.

583
00:24:24.597 --> 00:24:25.932
It changed your brain.

584
00:24:26.032 --> 00:24:28.167
No, Dad, let's just
see what happens.

585
00:24:28.267 --> 00:24:29.536
That's crazy.

586
00:24:29.636 --> 00:24:32.171
What's the harm in trying?

587
00:24:39.345 --> 00:24:41.147
* I don't swim, but I
give a long stroke *

588
00:24:41.247 --> 00:24:42.515
* Can I flex

589
00:24:42.615 --> 00:24:44.083
* While you get up in the rest

590
00:24:44.183 --> 00:24:46.018
* Get up in the gets
while I soak up my success *

591
00:24:46.118 --> 00:24:47.219
* Gettin' tokens
for your stress *

592
00:24:47.319 --> 00:24:48.855
* I'll be making
all the checks *

593
00:24:48.955 --> 00:24:50.590
* Any time you see me
step on the stage *

594
00:24:50.690 --> 00:24:52.792
It's the start of a new season

595
00:24:52.892 --> 00:24:56.028
with one sold-out
Mercedes-Benz Stadium.

596
00:24:56.128 --> 00:24:58.898
And Tony, here we go.

597
00:25:16.015 --> 00:25:18.150
* Caught up in your
feelin's like you froze *

598
00:25:18.250 --> 00:25:20.386
* Everything around
you gettin'-- *

599
00:25:20.486 --> 00:25:22.388
Well, on the
opening drive, Jim,

600
00:25:22.488 --> 00:25:25.692
look for the Falcons to
establish the run early today,

601
00:25:25.792 --> 00:25:27.059
especially with Anderson Fisher,

602
00:25:27.159 --> 00:25:29.328
who had a sensational
rookie season last year.

603
00:25:29.428 --> 00:25:31.964
It's a big story at
running back, no doubt, Tony.

604
00:25:32.064 --> 00:25:34.366
Anderson Fisher, the young star,

605
00:25:34.466 --> 00:25:37.069
looking to duplicate
his success from last year.

606
00:25:37.169 --> 00:25:40.272
And Taylor will start
out in the gun, here,

607
00:25:40.372 --> 00:25:41.874
and quickly some
pressure off the edge,

608
00:25:41.974 --> 00:25:43.710
and down he goes!

609
00:25:43.810 --> 00:25:45.211
Taylor, oh my gosh!

610
00:25:45.311 --> 00:25:47.914
Well, that's a rough
start right there.

611
00:25:48.014 --> 00:25:49.816
Fisher, that's your assignment.

612
00:25:49.916 --> 00:25:51.584
And, you know,
he's only in the second year.

613
00:25:51.684 --> 00:25:53.953
Mistakes are gonna happen.

614
00:25:54.053 --> 00:25:57.824
A mistake by Fisher.
And now it's second down.

615
00:25:59.525 --> 00:26:01.761
Twenty, hut!

616
00:26:01.861 --> 00:26:03.062
And they
give it to Fisher.

617
00:26:03.162 --> 00:26:05.698
He finds a hole,
but coughs it up.

618
00:26:05.798 --> 00:26:08.100
And the Falcons recover,
but my goodness,

619
00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:11.137
what a tough start
for Anderson Fisher.

620
00:26:11.804 --> 00:26:13.139
I agree with
Coach Evans here.

621
00:26:13.239 --> 00:26:15.074
To miss pass protection
on the first play

622
00:26:15.174 --> 00:26:16.843
and then fumble on the second?

623
00:26:16.943 --> 00:26:18.945
Here we go with the
veteran Bobby Coleman.

624
00:26:19.045 --> 00:26:20.713
A bold move,
no doubt, Ton.

625
00:26:20.813 --> 00:26:22.281
A surprising move.

626
00:26:22.381 --> 00:26:25.818
So from the young buck to
the veteran, Coleman here.

627
00:26:25.918 --> 00:26:28.688
Third down for the Falcons.

628
00:26:29.388 --> 00:26:31.057
Bobby! Bobby,
you're on the wrong side!

629
00:26:31.157 --> 00:26:34.193
Bobby's gotta
move over, Jim.

630
00:26:34.293 --> 00:26:35.928
Yeah, there ya go, Bobby.

631
00:26:37.463 --> 00:26:39.331
Ready in motion, motion!

632
00:26:40.332 --> 00:26:43.903
And Taylor, he's gonna
go up top on third and long.

633
00:26:44.003 --> 00:26:45.071
He's looking.

634
00:26:45.171 --> 00:26:47.273
He has nobody down field open.

635
00:26:47.373 --> 00:26:49.541
He's gonna check
this down to Coleman.

636
00:26:57.383 --> 00:27:00.286
Coleman with a
nice little sidestep.

637
00:27:00.386 --> 00:27:03.589
I mean, look at the spin
move by Bobby Coleman.

638
00:27:03.690 --> 00:27:06.558
Bobby Coleman
is making some moves--

639
00:27:06.659 --> 00:27:09.195
Ah! Oh, excuse me.

640
00:27:09.295 --> 00:27:10.663
--college,
he was the guy.

641
00:27:10.763 --> 00:27:12.564
How happy is he right now, Jim?

642
00:27:12.665 --> 00:27:14.433
You gotta look at that.

643
00:27:14.533 --> 00:27:17.603
Bobby Coleman showing off
that Heisman Trophy.

644
00:27:17.704 --> 00:27:21.173
He's got great in...stincts.

645
00:27:21.273 --> 00:27:22.408
Instincts weren't great

646
00:27:22.508 --> 00:27:23.943
when you put a wall
in front of him.

647
00:27:24.043 --> 00:27:25.544
Runs into the wall!

648
00:27:25.644 --> 00:27:26.713
No way!

649
00:27:26.813 --> 00:27:28.614
He was so amped up.

650
00:27:28.715 --> 00:27:30.316
I was right!

651
00:27:30.416 --> 00:27:31.751
This is
really impressive.

652
00:27:31.851 --> 00:27:33.085
I can't believe it worked.

653
00:27:33.185 --> 00:27:34.887
Six to nothing, Atlanta.

654
00:27:34.987 --> 00:27:37.824
Bobby Coleman, his glory
days being reclaimed

655
00:27:37.924 --> 00:27:39.525
for a moment, here.

656
00:27:39.625 --> 00:27:41.060
Yeah!

657
00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:44.030
He's been the
story so far today, Tony.

658
00:27:44.130 --> 00:27:46.198
He's going to reverse course.

659
00:27:47.199 --> 00:27:49.435
What is happening here?

660
00:27:51.137 --> 00:27:54.573
If I'm
Anderson Fisher, I'm worried...

661
00:27:54.673 --> 00:27:57.710
Another sidestep,
and there he goes!

662
00:27:57.810 --> 00:27:59.111
One more time, folks!

663
00:27:59.211 --> 00:28:02.481
Bobby Coleman, fourth
touchdown of the day.

664
00:28:06.285 --> 00:28:10.156
Even blowing a kiss to
his wife, Keisha, in the crowd.

665
00:28:10.256 --> 00:28:12.124
The shovel pass, and guess who?

666
00:28:12.224 --> 00:28:13.860
Bobby Coleman one more time.

667
00:28:13.960 --> 00:28:16.528
And the Panthers'
defense is playing well.

668
00:28:16.628 --> 00:28:19.999
But Bobby and the Falcons
are playing better.

669
00:28:20.099 --> 00:28:23.302
It's off the charts!

670
00:28:23.402 --> 00:28:25.171
This time, Coleman
splits out wide.

671
00:28:25.271 --> 00:28:26.505
They throw it to him.

672
00:28:26.605 --> 00:28:28.474
He's got three
Panthers ahead of him.

673
00:28:28.574 --> 00:28:29.608
What's he doing?

674
00:28:29.708 --> 00:28:30.709
He's going backwards.

675
00:28:30.810 --> 00:28:32.178
No! What are you doing?

676
00:28:32.278 --> 00:28:33.880
Oh, look at
what he's doing.

677
00:28:33.980 --> 00:28:36.515
What a move!

678
00:28:36.615 --> 00:28:39.185
He went backwards
to go forwards.

679
00:28:39.285 --> 00:28:41.320
Bobby Coleman is
having quite the day.

680
00:28:41.420 --> 00:28:44.190
And with
touchdown number six,

681
00:28:44.290 --> 00:28:48.995
tied with Gale Sayers for
the most touchdowns ever scored

682
00:28:49.095 --> 00:28:50.396
in a single game.

683
00:28:50.496 --> 00:28:52.064
I don't even know
what else to say.

684
00:28:52.164 --> 00:28:53.699
I can't say anything
about his performance.

685
00:28:53.800 --> 00:28:55.167
He scored six touchdowns...

686
00:28:55.267 --> 00:28:58.070
You were right, but...
This wasn't part of the plan.

687
00:28:59.705 --> 00:29:01.007
Look at this.

688
00:29:01.107 --> 00:29:03.542
He's breaking it down
in all sorts of ways.

689
00:29:03.642 --> 00:29:05.744
But this is
definitely gonna get a flag.

690
00:29:05.845 --> 00:29:09.148
And that's gonna be a
15-yard penalty for taunting.

691
00:29:09.248 --> 00:29:11.450
But after all that
he's done in this game,

692
00:29:11.550 --> 00:29:13.986
I think the fans are gonna
give him a pass on this one.

693
00:29:14.086 --> 00:29:15.521
Hey, he's ahead of the game.

694
00:29:15.621 --> 00:29:17.990
Joining him, his
wife's got it down too.

695
00:29:18.090 --> 00:29:20.827
His family has
to be on cloud nine.

696
00:29:20.927 --> 00:29:22.228
It's inspirational, Jim.

697
00:29:22.328 --> 00:29:23.963
I mean, truly, this guy was on

698
00:29:24.063 --> 00:29:25.832
the practice squad
three days ago.

699
00:29:25.932 --> 00:29:27.566
Whoo!

700
00:29:27.666 --> 00:29:30.036
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

701
00:29:41.213 --> 00:29:43.549
Yeah! Yeah!

702
00:29:43.649 --> 00:29:46.718
That's how we play!
That's how we play!

703
00:29:46.819 --> 00:29:48.587
Great job today!
Great job today!

704
00:29:48.687 --> 00:29:50.156
Listen up! Listen up.

705
00:29:50.256 --> 00:29:51.657
I am so proud of you guys.

706
00:29:51.757 --> 00:29:54.526
You play like that, we gonna
win a lot of football games.

707
00:29:56.795 --> 00:29:59.398
Execution, determination,
everything we talk about

708
00:29:59.498 --> 00:30:01.067
-in dirty bird football.

709
00:30:01.167 --> 00:30:02.568
Let me see that game ball.

710
00:30:02.668 --> 00:30:05.037
Speaking of that, today,

711
00:30:05.137 --> 00:30:08.107
a certain someone showed
he still got some wheels.

712
00:30:09.441 --> 00:30:11.043
And, and, and, and!

713
00:30:11.143 --> 00:30:12.511
Some questionable dance moves.

714
00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:16.215
You know who I'm talking about.
Bobby Coleman, hell of a job!

715
00:30:22.688 --> 00:30:24.723
Thank you.

716
00:30:29.428 --> 00:30:32.664
Bobby! Bobby!
Bobby!

717
00:30:41.707 --> 00:30:43.375
Those six touchdowns
gave me life.

718
00:30:43.475 --> 00:30:44.911
-Six!
- Six!

719
00:30:45.011 --> 00:30:46.412
I still can't believe it!

720
00:30:46.512 --> 00:30:47.947
Oh, well you gotta
believe it, baby.

721
00:30:48.047 --> 00:30:50.249
See, 'cause Bobby Coleman is
turning back the clock, baby.

722
00:30:50.349 --> 00:30:53.019
-Hey!
-That's right, that's right.

723
00:30:53.119 --> 00:30:55.354
It just felt like, um...

724
00:30:55.454 --> 00:30:58.357
Like you were possessed
out there or something.

725
00:30:58.457 --> 00:31:00.426
-It kind of felt like that.
- Yeah!

726
00:31:00.526 --> 00:31:01.627
It did.

727
00:31:01.727 --> 00:31:03.095
Just a vessel of some...

728
00:31:03.195 --> 00:31:06.232
greater power acting
through you.

729
00:31:06.332 --> 00:31:08.167
Oh, oh, oh, okay!

730
00:31:08.267 --> 00:31:09.768
You might get
the life you always wanted.

731
00:31:09.868 --> 00:31:11.137
-Yeah!
-Yes!

732
00:31:11.237 --> 00:31:12.771
-Amen!
-Amen!

733
00:31:12.871 --> 00:31:15.807
-Amen!
- Amen!

734
00:31:15.908 --> 00:31:18.010
* Nah, nah, nah-nah, nah

735
00:31:18.110 --> 00:31:20.980
* Nah, nah, nah, nah

736
00:31:21.080 --> 00:31:23.282
* You think you can play me

737
00:31:23.382 --> 00:31:25.451
* You think you
can play me *

738
00:31:25.551 --> 00:31:28.854
* You ain't gotta come for me

739
00:31:29.922 --> 00:31:31.657
Okay, hold on, hold on.

740
00:31:35.261 --> 00:31:37.263
* I got shooters
riding in Mercedes *

741
00:31:37.363 --> 00:31:39.831
-Bring it up, bring it up.
-Bring it up? Okay!

742
00:31:45.437 --> 00:31:47.273
Okay, so in honor of
our brand-new season,

743
00:31:47.373 --> 00:31:50.809
I have a little
surprise for everyone.

744
00:31:50.909 --> 00:31:53.245
Homemade robot iPhone cases!

745
00:31:53.345 --> 00:31:56.848
And these originally
designed T-shirts.

746
00:31:56.949 --> 00:32:00.252
Each phone case has a robot
that matches your T-shirts.

747
00:32:00.352 --> 00:32:02.989
You know, to your
individual personalities.

748
00:32:03.089 --> 00:32:05.557
Go, PossumBots.
Aren't they perfect?

749
00:32:05.657 --> 00:32:09.128
I mean, it's a little
much, but I'll take it.

750
00:32:09.228 --> 00:32:10.462
That's what I like to hear.

751
00:32:10.562 --> 00:32:13.599
Yeah, I appreciate this.
This is--this is dope.

752
00:32:13.699 --> 00:32:15.201
But y'all, I got the
video all set up.

753
00:32:15.301 --> 00:32:16.702
Y'all ready to see what
we doin' this year?

754
00:32:16.802 --> 00:32:18.537
-Ooh, yes!
-Yeah.

755
00:32:19.605 --> 00:32:23.175
Welcome to the
2022 First Robotics Competition.

756
00:32:23.275 --> 00:32:26.778
And this year's game?
Toxic Takedown.

757
00:32:26.878 --> 00:32:30.049
The Earth has been
overwhelmed by toxic waste.

758
00:32:30.149 --> 00:32:31.750
Using your removal droids,

759
00:32:31.850 --> 00:32:34.220
you'll collect
condensed toxic waste

760
00:32:34.320 --> 00:32:37.056
and launch it into
one of four depositories.

761
00:32:37.156 --> 00:32:39.191
The planet is counting on you!

762
00:32:39.291 --> 00:32:40.626
All right, guys.

763
00:32:40.726 --> 00:32:43.395
We should probably start
working on this right now.

764
00:32:43.495 --> 00:32:49.501
Or...we could procrastinate.

765
00:32:50.236 --> 00:32:51.703
* Let's go

766
00:32:55.674 --> 00:32:57.576
* Put your hands up in the sky

767
00:32:57.676 --> 00:33:00.246
* Just keeping the dream alive

768
00:33:12.058 --> 00:33:13.492
Oh!

769
00:33:15.727 --> 00:33:17.496
Whoa!

770
00:33:19.798 --> 00:33:20.999
Yo! You good?

771
00:33:21.100 --> 00:33:22.168
Whoa...

772
00:33:22.268 --> 00:33:23.369
That was wild.

773
00:33:23.469 --> 00:33:25.671
Yeah, I just got a
little distracted.

774
00:33:25.771 --> 00:33:27.073
Was it my face?

775
00:33:27.173 --> 00:33:29.208
Look, I keep meaning to tell
you not to be so distracted.

776
00:33:29.308 --> 00:33:31.009
Can you get over
yourself and help me out?

777
00:33:31.110 --> 00:33:32.544
All right, I got you.

778
00:33:33.579 --> 00:33:35.514
I did not expect
these tacos to be so good.

779
00:33:35.614 --> 00:33:37.083
Right? I've been here
for almost four years

780
00:33:37.183 --> 00:33:38.317
and I'm still not sick of them.

781
00:33:38.417 --> 00:33:40.786
My dad's in the military,
so we move around a lot.

782
00:33:40.886 --> 00:33:43.222
But good food always helps.
Mm-hmm.

783
00:33:43.322 --> 00:33:45.424
Four years is impressive.

784
00:33:45.524 --> 00:33:47.893
Yeah, the longest I ever
lived somewhere was three.

785
00:33:47.993 --> 00:33:49.128
But that was Jacksonville,

786
00:33:49.228 --> 00:33:53.732
so I was kind of happy my
dad got traded, so, yeah.

787
00:33:53.832 --> 00:33:58.237
But, um, hey, thanks for making
me feel like a part of the team.

788
00:33:58.337 --> 00:33:59.305
Hey, you're a great addition.

789
00:33:59.405 --> 00:34:02.074
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

790
00:34:02.174 --> 00:34:06.912
You know, my family has
always revolved around my dad.

791
00:34:07.012 --> 00:34:08.980
I mean, it's fine, but I
just never really experienced

792
00:34:09.081 --> 00:34:11.950
anything outside of that.

793
00:34:12.050 --> 00:34:14.386
So it just feels good to
be Callie Coleman for once

794
00:34:14.486 --> 00:34:16.322
and not just Bobby
Coleman's daughter.

795
00:34:16.422 --> 00:34:18.724
-You know what? I feel that.
-Yeah.

796
00:34:20.959 --> 00:34:23.629
And Taylor
hands off to Coleman.

797
00:34:23.729 --> 00:34:26.732
And look at him zig-zagging
through the snow!

798
00:34:26.832 --> 00:34:30.169
Is it me,
or is Bobby Coleman

799
00:34:30.269 --> 00:34:33.805
making yet another
unbelievable play?

800
00:34:33.905 --> 00:34:37.376
It's, uh, not perfect.

801
00:34:37.476 --> 00:34:39.345
But what are we thinking?

802
00:34:39.445 --> 00:34:42.114
That you're a genius! What?

803
00:34:42.214 --> 00:34:44.650
The structure is crazy!
We can do so much with that.

804
00:34:44.750 --> 00:34:46.718
Ooh, ooh, we can throw
the circuits in the back.

805
00:34:46.818 --> 00:34:49.521
And if we rotate
that arm, great launch.

806
00:34:49.621 --> 00:34:51.990
It's already, like, perfect.

807
00:34:52.090 --> 00:34:54.326
Guys...gold stickers!

808
00:34:55.561 --> 00:34:56.828
Yes, Zoe, yeah.

809
00:34:56.928 --> 00:35:00.332
Falcons on
the 2-yard line.

810
00:35:00.432 --> 00:35:02.834
And it's handed to Coleman.

811
00:35:02.934 --> 00:35:07.606
Oh! He flips over the top
like we've never seen before!

812
00:35:07.706 --> 00:35:08.840
Yeah!

813
00:35:08.940 --> 00:35:10.642
I don't know
what radioactive spider

814
00:35:10.742 --> 00:35:12.511
bit Bobby Coleman, but this
is the fifth game in a row...

815
00:35:12.611 --> 00:35:14.913
Yes! My baby can fly.

816
00:35:17.349 --> 00:35:20.152
We got a good thing
going or what, huh?

817
00:35:22.354 --> 00:35:24.490
* Watch the fam eat,
never starve *

818
00:35:24.590 --> 00:35:26.024
Coleman,
just one hand,

819
00:35:26.124 --> 00:35:28.227
and he stops Garner.

820
00:35:29.828 --> 00:35:31.363
Yeah! Whoo!

821
00:35:31.463 --> 00:35:33.965
He's gonna bust
out the dance moves.

822
00:35:34.065 --> 00:35:35.801
You can stay up
here if you want to, Jim,

823
00:35:35.901 --> 00:35:38.170
but I'm going to the
field to dance with

824
00:35:38.270 --> 00:35:39.805
Bobby Coleman and the Falcons.

825
00:35:39.905 --> 00:35:42.441
-Peri, head of PR.
-Nice to meet you, Peri.

826
00:35:42.541 --> 00:35:43.942
That was quite a game.

827
00:35:44.042 --> 00:35:46.545
I have never heard the
press room buzzing like this.

828
00:35:46.645 --> 00:35:47.946
-Buzzing for me?
-Mm-hmm.

829
00:35:48.046 --> 00:35:50.549
Hi, can I get
a chamomile tea, please?

830
00:35:51.750 --> 00:35:53.352
You're Bobby Coleman's wife,
right?

831
00:35:53.452 --> 00:35:55.621
-Yes.
-Girl, okay.

832
00:35:55.721 --> 00:35:58.524
It is on the house
for the whole season.

833
00:35:58.624 --> 00:36:03.028
-Are you serious?
-Yeah!

834
00:36:03.128 --> 00:36:05.931
Okay, okay!

835
00:36:06.031 --> 00:36:07.633
* Gotta elevate

836
00:36:07.733 --> 00:36:09.801
* No more looking back
'cause I stay in the game *

837
00:36:09.901 --> 00:36:12.938
* On to the next,
I don't see no contest *

838
00:36:14.172 --> 00:36:16.475
Last bit of business.
What do we call it?

839
00:36:16.575 --> 00:36:19.511
SpongeBot SpareParts.

840
00:36:19.611 --> 00:36:20.646
-That was dope.
-I like that.

841
00:36:20.746 --> 00:36:22.314
-Yeah?
-Let's do it!

842
00:36:22.414 --> 00:36:25.050
* No more looking back
'cause I stay in the game *

843
00:36:28.053 --> 00:36:29.755
I got big news! Big news!

844
00:36:29.855 --> 00:36:31.357
Coach just told me
I'm starting next game.

845
00:36:31.457 --> 00:36:33.792
Not Anderson, me.

846
00:36:33.892 --> 00:36:35.727
It's been 10 years
since I've started.

847
00:36:35.827 --> 00:36:38.497
Mm! A small knock
might've been nice.

848
00:36:38.597 --> 00:36:43.502
Hey, it's all happening!
It's all happening.

849
00:36:43.602 --> 00:36:45.304
And--and this game is
the most important so far,

850
00:36:45.404 --> 00:36:48.940
so I need you to make sure I'm
at my absolute best this Sunday.

851
00:36:49.040 --> 00:36:51.910
-Wait, this--this Sunday?

852
00:36:52.010 --> 00:36:54.380
Wait, you got somewhere
more important to be?

853
00:36:54.480 --> 00:36:56.948
Yeah, the robotics regionals.

854
00:36:57.048 --> 00:36:58.817
Can't you just scoot
away, you know,

855
00:36:58.917 --> 00:37:03.322
when you're not doing your thing
so you can do our thing, huh?

856
00:37:03.422 --> 00:37:05.691
The thing that's got me
starting

857
00:37:05.791 --> 00:37:09.561
over Anderson Fisher.

858
00:37:09.661 --> 00:37:11.930
Maybe.

859
00:37:12.030 --> 00:37:17.135
Callie, I-I need you.
Your dad needs you.

860
00:37:17.235 --> 00:37:18.970
-I need you.

861
00:37:21.072 --> 00:37:22.574
Yeah. Of course.

862
00:37:22.674 --> 00:37:25.176
I'm--I'm sure I can manage.

863
00:37:25.277 --> 00:37:27.245
-That's my girl.
-Mm-hmm.

864
00:37:27.346 --> 00:37:30.048
Yes!

865
00:37:40.426 --> 00:37:41.760
Ladies
and gentlemen,

866
00:37:41.860 --> 00:37:44.563
welcome to First Robotics
Regional Competition.

867
00:37:44.663 --> 00:37:46.565
You will begin in five minutes.

868
00:37:46.665 --> 00:37:49.535
Teams, prepare your robots.

869
00:38:18.964 --> 00:38:20.499
CBS Sports.

870
00:38:20.599 --> 00:38:23.034
EA Sports--
Get in the game.

871
00:38:24.903 --> 00:38:26.838
Sorry.
Just doing a little recon.

872
00:38:26.938 --> 00:38:28.474
-Yes!
- Dellview!

873
00:38:28.574 --> 00:38:30.542
You guys are up!

874
00:38:30.642 --> 00:38:32.177
- Paws up!
- Let's do this!

875
00:38:32.277 --> 00:38:33.712
Go!

876
00:38:33.812 --> 00:38:35.614
* All I do is win, win,
win, no matter what *

877
00:38:35.714 --> 00:38:39.150
* Got money on my mind,
I can never get enough *

878
00:38:40.586 --> 00:38:41.687
There you go.

879
00:38:41.787 --> 00:38:44.155
* Everybody hands go up

880
00:38:45.223 --> 00:38:46.992
You know what they
say about great players.

881
00:38:47.092 --> 00:38:51.563
The more personal you are,
the more valuable you are.

882
00:38:51.663 --> 00:38:54.099
And he's all
alone down the sideline.

883
00:38:54.199 --> 00:38:58.937
And he leaps in for good
measure for the touchdown!

884
00:39:06.712 --> 00:39:08.747
And Coleman
comes back just in time

885
00:39:08.847 --> 00:39:10.816
to make an incredibly
difficult play.

886
00:39:10.916 --> 00:39:12.951
This is quite
the balancing act.

887
00:39:14.920 --> 00:39:16.187
Whoo!

888
00:39:21.460 --> 00:39:23.228
Stop!

889
00:39:23.328 --> 00:39:24.896
Someone just threw up

890
00:39:24.996 --> 00:39:27.966
all the way at the other
end of the building,

891
00:39:28.066 --> 00:39:31.269
and it's just so,
so far from here.

892
00:39:31.369 --> 00:39:32.771
Worst than bingo night.

893
00:39:32.871 --> 00:39:35.106
* All I do is win, win,
win, no matter what *

894
00:39:35.206 --> 00:39:37.843
And now Coleman,
it's like he's frozen in time.

895
00:39:37.943 --> 00:39:39.878
Multitasking
is important.

896
00:39:39.978 --> 00:39:41.680
Trying to figure out
exactly which way to go?

897
00:39:41.780 --> 00:39:43.048
Also important.

898
00:39:43.148 --> 00:39:45.016
Look at that.
Focus regained.

899
00:39:45.116 --> 00:39:47.419
And now he just heads
straight to the sideline.

900
00:39:47.519 --> 00:39:49.421
Crisis narrowly averted.

901
00:39:49.521 --> 00:39:51.356
Despite defenders
coming from every direction,

902
00:39:51.457 --> 00:39:56.094
Coleman bobs and weaves,
somehow finding a clear path.

903
00:39:57.128 --> 00:39:59.998
-Hey.
-Were you just in the closet?

904
00:40:00.098 --> 00:40:02.734
No. No, no.

905
00:40:04.603 --> 00:40:06.438
What's going on?

906
00:40:08.373 --> 00:40:09.374
Is something wrong?

907
00:40:09.475 --> 00:40:12.911
'Cause you know you can tell me.

908
00:40:16.782 --> 00:40:19.050
I'm good.

909
00:40:19.150 --> 00:40:20.185
Mom, I'm fine.

910
00:40:20.285 --> 00:40:23.722
I'm just a little
stressed with the, um...

911
00:40:23.822 --> 00:40:25.190
the robot stuff.

912
00:40:25.290 --> 00:40:27.559
It's crazy in there.
But I gotta get back in there.

913
00:40:27.659 --> 00:40:29.260
See you in there.

914
00:40:34.900 --> 00:40:37.402
No, no, no!
Can't control it!

915
00:40:37.503 --> 00:40:39.270
What should we do?

916
00:40:41.439 --> 00:40:43.241
Oh my gosh!

917
00:40:44.442 --> 00:40:45.611
Callie, watch out!

918
00:40:45.711 --> 00:40:47.278
Oh my god.

919
00:40:47.378 --> 00:40:48.747
Callie!

920
00:40:51.717 --> 00:40:53.485
What is she doing?

921
00:40:55.821 --> 00:40:58.490
* All I do is win, win,
win, no matter what *

922
00:40:58.590 --> 00:41:01.760
* Got money on my mind,
I can never get enough *

923
00:41:01.860 --> 00:41:03.962
* And every time I step
up in the building *

924
00:41:04.062 --> 00:41:06.297
* Everybody hands go up

925
00:41:06.397 --> 00:41:07.866
-Yes!
-My god!

926
00:41:07.966 --> 00:41:10.936
* And they stay there
And they stay there *

927
00:41:11.036 --> 00:41:12.904
* And they stay there

928
00:41:19.244 --> 00:41:21.813
* Put your hands in the air,
make 'em stay there *

929
00:41:21.913 --> 00:41:23.081
Anderson, how does it feel

930
00:41:23.181 --> 00:41:24.716
knowing your teammate's
on track to break

931
00:41:24.816 --> 00:41:26.585
your single-season
rushing record?

932
00:41:26.685 --> 00:41:30.121
I mean, gotta be
some mixed emotions.

933
00:41:31.222 --> 00:41:33.792
Whatever gets the
team a win, right?

934
00:41:33.892 --> 00:41:35.927
But, uh, I would like to
know how he's doing it.

935
00:41:36.027 --> 00:41:37.629
Anybody wanna know?

936
00:41:37.729 --> 00:41:39.364
Hey, maybe it's a, I
don't know, a ripple

937
00:41:39.464 --> 00:41:41.066
in time-space continuum.

938
00:41:42.734 --> 00:41:43.702
Comedian!

939
00:41:43.802 --> 00:41:45.436
No, but seriously, though.

940
00:41:45.537 --> 00:41:47.939
How are you doing it, my boy?

941
00:41:48.039 --> 00:41:50.876
Come on, Bobby,
what's your secret?

942
00:41:50.976 --> 00:41:53.111
I'd have to say, honestly,
the support of my family.

943
00:41:53.211 --> 00:41:54.846
Those two ladies right
there in the back?

944
00:41:54.946 --> 00:41:56.147
They just started
supporting you, huh?

945
00:41:56.247 --> 00:41:57.415
Yeah. Huh?

946
00:41:57.515 --> 00:41:59.651
How are you guys feeling
about Bobby's season so far?

947
00:41:59.751 --> 00:42:03.488
Oh, we are just so
very proud of him.

948
00:42:03.589 --> 00:42:05.557
-Right, Callie.
-Yeah.

949
00:42:05.657 --> 00:42:07.025
Yeah, I mean, totally.

950
00:42:07.125 --> 00:42:10.495
I mean, we're sort of like
our own team, you know?

951
00:42:10.596 --> 00:42:13.999
We feel like we're a very
big part of his success.

952
00:42:14.099 --> 00:42:17.368
Like, a very big part.

953
00:42:20.238 --> 00:42:21.607
She's not wrong.

954
00:42:21.707 --> 00:42:23.609
Uh, I couldn't do
it without her.

955
00:42:23.709 --> 00:42:25.410
Without them, I mean.

956
00:42:25.510 --> 00:42:26.878
He really couldn't.

957
00:42:26.978 --> 00:42:28.213
Real cute family moment, right?

958
00:42:28.313 --> 00:42:29.881
Let's get back to
the football questions.

959
00:42:29.981 --> 00:42:32.684
Well actually,
given how supportive

960
00:42:32.784 --> 00:42:34.052
your daughter has been,

961
00:42:34.152 --> 00:42:36.521
don't you think she
deserves her own car?

962
00:42:36.622 --> 00:42:39.024
Or at the very least,
is able to borrow yours

963
00:42:39.124 --> 00:42:41.426
so she can hang out
with her friends?

964
00:42:41.526 --> 00:42:42.794
What do you say, Bobby?

965
00:42:42.894 --> 00:42:45.196
I say, you know, we can
talk about it at home.

966
00:42:45.296 --> 00:42:46.231
Right, Callie?

967
00:42:46.331 --> 00:42:48.266
But the people want
answers, Coleman!

968
00:42:52.137 --> 00:42:53.304
Here we go!
Stand by.

969
00:42:53.404 --> 00:42:56.207
Five, four, three...

970
00:42:56.307 --> 00:42:58.509
So what is it being like
in the Coleman household?

971
00:42:58.610 --> 00:43:00.511
-I would say busy.
-Yeah, busy.

972
00:43:00.612 --> 00:43:01.980
-Real busy.
-Okay.

973
00:43:02.080 --> 00:43:04.015
But, I mean, you know,
we've just been hanging out,

974
00:43:04.115 --> 00:43:05.116
playing a lot of Madden .

975
00:43:05.216 --> 00:43:06.785
I love it.

976
00:43:06.885 --> 00:43:08.687
Gotta get that player rating up
because, it's--it's way too low.

977
00:43:08.787 --> 00:43:10.521
Yeah,
we're working on it.

978
00:43:10.622 --> 00:43:13.424
Yeah, we're--
she's working on it.

979
00:43:13.524 --> 00:43:14.993
Working on it.

980
00:43:15.093 --> 00:43:16.762
Does that mean he's working
on that new car for you?

981
00:43:16.862 --> 00:43:18.096
Oh no, Burleson,
you're killing me.

982
00:43:18.196 --> 00:43:19.698
My bad, my bad.

983
00:43:19.798 --> 00:43:21.366
But you, Bobby,
you've been killing it

984
00:43:21.466 --> 00:43:23.334
-on the football field.
-Thank you, man.

985
00:43:23.434 --> 00:43:25.403
Playing
like a man 15 years younger.

986
00:43:25.503 --> 00:43:26.604
Yeah, I appreciate that.

987
00:43:26.705 --> 00:43:28.439
I think
every guy wants to know.

988
00:43:28.539 --> 00:43:30.608
To be honest, I wanna know.

989
00:43:30.709 --> 00:43:32.110
What is the secret?

990
00:43:32.210 --> 00:43:35.213
-Ah, no secret.
- No secret?

991
00:43:35.313 --> 00:43:36.314
No secret.

992
00:43:36.414 --> 00:43:38.216
Come on, Callie,
say it with me.

993
00:43:38.316 --> 00:43:40.585
The people want answers!

994
00:43:41.820 --> 00:43:44.355
It ain't that funny!
Laugh again.

995
00:43:48.059 --> 00:43:49.227
Hey, girl.
You have a sec?

996
00:43:49.327 --> 00:43:50.962
We are totally
stumped over here.

997
00:43:51.062 --> 00:43:53.264
Does this circuit
look right to you?

998
00:43:53.364 --> 00:43:57.002
-Hey, Callie.
-Ready for us, superstar?

999
00:43:57.102 --> 00:43:59.570
Sorry guys, I gotta run.
Good luck!

1000
00:44:01.673 --> 00:44:03.809
* Like hey, like hey

1001
00:44:03.909 --> 00:44:05.510
* Everybody in the place okay

1002
00:44:05.610 --> 00:44:07.946
* We got you feeling
like hey, rock the party *

1003
00:44:08.046 --> 00:44:10.281
* Got you feeling
like hey, rock the party *

1004
00:44:10.381 --> 00:44:11.983
* Are you feeling a way?

1005
00:44:12.083 --> 00:44:15.420
* Well, okay, okay, okay

1006
00:44:15.520 --> 00:44:17.555
* Now you're feeling like
hey, rock the party *

1007
00:44:17.655 --> 00:44:19.925
* Got you feeling like
hey, rock the party *

1008
00:44:20.025 --> 00:44:21.693
* Are you feeling a way?

1009
00:44:21.793 --> 00:44:25.296
* Well, okay, okay, okay

1010
00:44:25.997 --> 00:44:28.433
* Job, late nights,
gotta get it right *

1011
00:44:29.134 --> 00:44:30.836
Peri, just the woman
I've been meaning to see.

1012
00:44:30.936 --> 00:44:32.337
Question, bobblehead.

1013
00:44:32.437 --> 00:44:35.340
Do we have a release
date for those yet?

1014
00:44:35.440 --> 00:44:38.309
Peri, look, I'm a
real-life bobblehead.

1015
00:44:38.409 --> 00:44:40.111
Look!

1016
00:44:45.383 --> 00:44:47.352
* Rock with me in the magic

1017
00:44:48.820 --> 00:44:51.089
Thanks for the love, G.

1018
00:44:52.023 --> 00:44:53.558
* Everybody in the place to be

1019
00:44:53.658 --> 00:44:56.127
* Put your hands in the sky,
reaching out to my people *

1020
00:44:56.227 --> 00:44:57.428
* All around the globe

1021
00:44:57.528 --> 00:44:58.797
* Tapped in while
the beat goes *

1022
00:44:58.897 --> 00:45:01.199
* Feeling like hey, like hey

1023
00:45:01.299 --> 00:45:03.301
* Everybody in the place okay

1024
00:45:03.401 --> 00:45:05.670
* We got you feeling like
hey, rock the party *

1025
00:45:05.771 --> 00:45:07.372
Whew!

1026
00:45:09.174 --> 00:45:12.077
Would you look at that?

1027
00:45:12.177 --> 00:45:13.779
* Can you feel, can
you feel the wave? *

1028
00:45:13.879 --> 00:45:15.747
* Keep our hands high,
feeling it all right *

1029
00:45:15.847 --> 00:45:18.316
* Let the beat play,
movin' us side to side *

1030
00:45:18.416 --> 00:45:20.485
* 'Cause this music is
a vibe they can't deny *

1031
00:45:20.585 --> 00:45:22.420
* Just turning up,
let it go all night *

1032
00:45:22.520 --> 00:45:24.823
* So we're being like
hey, rock the party *

1033
00:45:24.923 --> 00:45:26.557
* Can you feel the wave?

1034
00:45:26.657 --> 00:45:28.126
* Okay

1035
00:45:28.226 --> 00:45:31.029
* Tell me, can you feel,
can you feel the wave? *

1036
00:45:32.764 --> 00:45:33.799
We're happy you're back.

1037
00:45:33.899 --> 00:45:35.767
Yeah, we really needed you.

1038
00:45:35.867 --> 00:45:36.835
What you--no, what you--

1039
00:45:36.935 --> 00:45:38.203
Now, what are you lookin' at?

1040
00:45:38.303 --> 00:45:40.138
-Nothing.

1041
00:45:53.819 --> 00:45:54.719
-Yeah?
-Mm-hmm.

1042
00:45:54.820 --> 00:45:56.354
All right.

1043
00:46:01.326 --> 00:46:04.329
Sorry, guys, I...
I gotta head out.

1044
00:46:15.140 --> 00:46:19.144
Hey, Callie! Can't you stay?

1045
00:46:19.244 --> 00:46:21.646
Oh, well, it's just with my dad.

1046
00:46:21.746 --> 00:46:23.849
Your dad. Yeah, um,

1047
00:46:23.949 --> 00:46:24.983
see, we're
just kind of counting on you

1048
00:46:25.083 --> 00:46:26.384
to redesign the arm.

1049
00:46:26.484 --> 00:46:28.186
I mean, we can't
really do anything

1050
00:46:28.286 --> 00:46:30.155
until you do that, so...

1051
00:46:30.255 --> 00:46:33.158
Okay, well, look,
it's literally been...

1052
00:46:33.258 --> 00:46:35.426
-It's been insane.
-I get it.

1053
00:46:35.526 --> 00:46:37.628
But we can't just
keep waiting on you.

1054
00:46:37.728 --> 00:46:41.066
I mean, if you need to
quit, we understand.

1055
00:46:41.166 --> 00:46:44.135
No, no no no, I never said
anything about quitting.

1056
00:46:44.235 --> 00:46:46.004
I want to be on the team.

1057
00:46:46.104 --> 00:46:49.640
And I promise you
I will get it done.

1058
00:46:49.740 --> 00:46:51.910
-Okay.
-Cool.

1059
00:46:52.010 --> 00:46:53.344
I'll see ya.

1060
00:46:57.916 --> 00:46:59.517
Rise up.

1061
00:47:01.386 --> 00:47:03.188
Don't mind if I do.

1062
00:47:46.164 --> 00:47:47.398
All right, man, what's up, huh?

1063
00:47:47.498 --> 00:47:49.467
'Cause you creepin' me out.

1064
00:47:49.567 --> 00:47:50.801
Look.

1065
00:47:50.902 --> 00:47:53.238
I'ma level with you.

1066
00:47:53.338 --> 00:47:57.108
I don't get a guy your age,
with your history,

1067
00:47:57.208 --> 00:47:59.844
can just elevate his game
like that in one night.

1068
00:48:02.580 --> 00:48:04.049
I know I'm better than you.

1069
00:48:04.149 --> 00:48:05.984
Is it that hard to believe?

1070
00:48:06.084 --> 00:48:07.518
Yeah.

1071
00:48:07.618 --> 00:48:10.455
Look, I don't know
how you're doin' it,

1072
00:48:10.555 --> 00:48:13.291
but I know it's not normal.

1073
00:48:15.393 --> 00:48:16.894
What's your secret?

1074
00:48:20.331 --> 00:48:21.399
Nate! Thanks for coming

1075
00:48:21.499 --> 00:48:23.101
and helping
with the robotics arm.

1076
00:48:23.201 --> 00:48:24.435
I've been really busy.

1077
00:48:24.535 --> 00:48:25.736
You know, we're
a little behind, so...

1078
00:48:25.836 --> 00:48:27.238
Yeah.

1079
00:48:27.338 --> 00:48:28.906
I brought some tacos.

1080
00:48:29.007 --> 00:48:31.342
I can't wait to see
your arm design.

1081
00:48:31.442 --> 00:48:35.280
Uh, so this is my room.

1082
00:48:35.380 --> 00:48:37.882
So, okay, um, I haven't
made a lot of progress,

1083
00:48:37.983 --> 00:48:40.118
but I can just show you
some of the basic schematics.

1084
00:48:40.218 --> 00:48:41.686
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1085
00:48:41.786 --> 00:48:43.221
You got Madden ?

1086
00:48:43.321 --> 00:48:45.123
And it's signed by
Anderson Fisher!

1087
00:48:45.223 --> 00:48:46.357
You don't--you
don't play Madden .

1088
00:48:46.457 --> 00:48:47.959
Oh, okay, you haven't heard?

1089
00:48:48.059 --> 00:48:50.261
Girls play video games too,
so...

1090
00:48:50.361 --> 00:48:51.696
-Oh, is that right?
-Mm-hmm.

1091
00:48:51.796 --> 00:48:53.064
Change of plans.

1092
00:48:53.164 --> 00:48:54.699
I think we should
get a warm-up game in

1093
00:48:54.799 --> 00:48:56.567
before we dive into
the schematics.

1094
00:48:56.667 --> 00:49:00.405
And if I lose--if I lose--
we play some games.

1095
00:49:00.505 --> 00:49:01.806
Guess we playin'
two games, then.

1096
00:49:01.906 --> 00:49:02.840
Oh, is that right?

1097
00:49:02.940 --> 00:49:04.175
-Uh-huh.
-Okay, gotcha.

1098
00:49:04.275 --> 00:49:06.644
You know, it's a mix
of the agility training

1099
00:49:06.744 --> 00:49:08.846
meets the mindfulness
exercises, all right?

1100
00:49:08.946 --> 00:49:09.814
Over and over.

1101
00:49:09.914 --> 00:49:11.949
And, um...

1102
00:49:12.050 --> 00:49:13.985
Dietary changes.

1103
00:49:14.085 --> 00:49:15.286
What dietary changes?

1104
00:49:15.386 --> 00:49:20.291
Um...special
high-performance smoothie.

1105
00:49:20.391 --> 00:49:22.727
-A high-performance smoothie?
-Yeah.

1106
00:49:22.827 --> 00:49:24.162
Listen, I gotta rock.

1107
00:49:24.262 --> 00:49:26.497
Sensei says I should, you know,
meditate every three hours.

1108
00:49:26.597 --> 00:49:28.866
And, so, let me
just get on out of here.

1109
00:49:28.966 --> 00:49:30.835
You know what?

1110
00:49:30.935 --> 00:49:34.372
I could really use one of those
high-performance smoothies.

1111
00:49:34.472 --> 00:49:36.907
How 'bout you make one?
Right now.

1112
00:49:37.008 --> 00:49:38.843
Whoo!

1113
00:49:38.943 --> 00:49:40.745
Okay, um, wait, remind me.

1114
00:49:40.845 --> 00:49:44.015
In football, more points
are better, right?

1115
00:49:44.115 --> 00:49:45.516
You know, let's go through the
tutorial real quick.

1116
00:49:45.616 --> 00:49:46.984
Like, really teach
you how to play.

1117
00:49:47.085 --> 00:49:48.219
Oh, you a savage, huh?

1118
00:49:48.319 --> 00:49:49.520
You know I let you
win this one, right?

1119
00:49:49.620 --> 00:49:51.022
-Oh, for real?
-I had to.

1120
00:49:51.122 --> 00:49:52.390
You can't--okay.
Whatever.

1121
00:49:52.490 --> 00:49:53.724
How come you don't
play as your dad?

1122
00:49:53.824 --> 00:49:55.026
He's hot right now.

1123
00:49:55.126 --> 00:49:56.594
It's like he's having
a second coming or something.

1124
00:49:56.694 --> 00:49:58.796
Well, I only play him
for actual games.

1125
00:49:58.896 --> 00:50:01.632
-What?

1126
00:50:01.732 --> 00:50:03.368
Um...

1127
00:50:04.902 --> 00:50:08.606
Um, well, what I mean is
when I'm not there with him,

1128
00:50:08.706 --> 00:50:10.941
like with my family, I, um...

1129
00:50:11.042 --> 00:50:15.080
I play him in Madden to
make it feel like I'm there.

1130
00:50:15.180 --> 00:50:16.747
Yeah, yeah, like, um...

1131
00:50:16.847 --> 00:50:19.250
We call it
virtual bonding, so, yeah.

1132
00:50:19.350 --> 00:50:21.419
How about I just
grab us some sodas?

1133
00:50:21.519 --> 00:50:22.987
That seems accurate, yeah.
I will be right back.

1134
00:50:23.088 --> 00:50:25.856
I'm not--I'm not...thirsty.

1135
00:50:28.093 --> 00:50:29.327
Okay.

1136
00:50:34.732 --> 00:50:36.033
Ah, okay.

1137
00:50:36.134 --> 00:50:37.435
Really need your
blueberries, right?

1138
00:50:37.535 --> 00:50:39.237
Need your antioxidants.

1139
00:50:39.337 --> 00:50:40.705
Then you get your strawberries.

1140
00:50:40.805 --> 00:50:43.841
Get it all in there.
Yep, everything, that's it.

1141
00:50:43.941 --> 00:50:46.010
Yeah, right there.

1142
00:50:46.111 --> 00:50:47.445
Banana in.

1143
00:50:49.314 --> 00:50:50.781
Whole thing.
With the peel on.

1144
00:50:50.881 --> 00:50:51.782
With the peel?

1145
00:50:51.882 --> 00:50:53.184
A little oatmeal
never hurt anybody.

1146
00:50:53.284 --> 00:50:54.885
Two scoops.

1147
00:50:55.386 --> 00:50:56.854
Or more.

1148
00:50:59.290 --> 00:51:01.359
Aah!

1149
00:51:01.459 --> 00:51:04.395
Yo! Fallen
and you can't get up?

1150
00:51:04.495 --> 00:51:07.832
I just fumbled the spoon.
I'm old, G.

1151
00:51:21.279 --> 00:51:22.680
Yes, yes.

1152
00:51:22.780 --> 00:51:26.717
The key is, uh,
the milk, right?

1153
00:51:26.817 --> 00:51:27.685
You know?

1154
00:51:27.785 --> 00:51:30.888
But never from a cow.

1155
00:51:30.988 --> 00:51:33.691
Only oat or goat--
it won't make you bloat.

1156
00:51:36.794 --> 00:51:39.930
I gotta say, man, sound like
a normal old smoothie to me.

1157
00:51:40.030 --> 00:51:42.567
I don't like the hair,
so let's put a fro on him.

1158
00:51:46.371 --> 00:51:47.738
Yo, I'm
gonna be your age

1159
00:51:47.838 --> 00:51:49.674
by the time you're finished
making this smoothie, man.

1160
00:51:53.878 --> 00:51:55.213
Yo! Can I help?

1161
00:51:55.313 --> 00:51:57.282
I'm good.
I'm all good.

1162
00:52:10.261 --> 00:52:11.729
Yeah.

1163
00:52:15.566 --> 00:52:17.568
Put some blond hair on him.

1164
00:52:25.243 --> 00:52:26.277
Yo, can I help?

1165
00:52:26.377 --> 00:52:28.346
No, just
keep shooting pool.

1166
00:52:28.446 --> 00:52:30.281
Don't move at all.

1167
00:52:35.553 --> 00:52:39.624
The real secret is
all about the fertilizer.

1168
00:52:39.724 --> 00:52:42.960
You gotta fertilize yourself.

1169
00:52:43.060 --> 00:52:44.629
Nasty.

1170
00:52:44.729 --> 00:52:47.932
All right, now we'll add
some junk to that trunk.

1171
00:52:51.035 --> 00:52:52.537
I'm coming back there.

1172
00:52:52.637 --> 00:52:55.240
Why? Why?

1173
00:52:55.340 --> 00:52:56.541
That's how he should look.

1174
00:52:56.641 --> 00:52:58.776
That's exactly how
he should look.

1175
00:52:58.876 --> 00:53:01.779
What are you doing?
That's my dad!

1176
00:53:02.380 --> 00:53:04.482
Whoa, relax.

1177
00:53:04.582 --> 00:53:05.850
You know, I thought
it was funny.

1178
00:53:05.950 --> 00:53:07.618
Well, it's not!

1179
00:53:11.489 --> 00:53:13.090
I got my butt back!

1180
00:53:13.190 --> 00:53:15.192
What?

1181
00:53:15.293 --> 00:53:16.827
Oh, it's a Gen-Z thing.

1182
00:53:16.927 --> 00:53:18.563
It's kind of like,
you know, I figured it out.

1183
00:53:18.663 --> 00:53:20.365
I got my butt back!

1184
00:53:20.465 --> 00:53:21.399
What did you do?

1185
00:53:21.499 --> 00:53:23.000
What else did you change?

1186
00:53:23.100 --> 00:53:26.637
Look, you know what?
I think I'll just head out.

1187
00:53:26.737 --> 00:53:29.139
I didn't you'd get so upset
over a little video game.

1188
00:53:29.240 --> 00:53:31.876
Wait, Nate, Nate, look. Um...

1189
00:53:31.976 --> 00:53:37.047
Okay, so you may not know,
but the game,

1190
00:53:37.147 --> 00:53:38.616
it's, um, uh...

1191
00:53:38.716 --> 00:53:41.151
It's...
It's, um...

1192
00:53:41.252 --> 00:53:42.687
-Well, I...
-You know what?

1193
00:53:42.787 --> 00:53:44.789
I'll just see you at school.

1194
00:53:52.697 --> 00:53:54.765
That's great.

1195
00:53:59.404 --> 00:54:00.738
It's the hospital.
I gotta take this.

1196
00:54:00.838 --> 00:54:03.608
But don't move.
I made brownies to eat.

1197
00:54:05.075 --> 00:54:06.777
Hey, what's up?

1198
00:54:08.479 --> 00:54:09.547
Wanna tell me what
happened to me today?

1199
00:54:09.647 --> 00:54:11.248
It was my friend.

1200
00:54:11.349 --> 00:54:13.318
I shouldn't have left him
alone with the game, all right?

1201
00:54:13.418 --> 00:54:15.786
All right, look, Anderson was
real suspicious of me today.

1202
00:54:15.886 --> 00:54:16.987
Okay? He could ruin
everything for me.

1203
00:54:17.087 --> 00:54:19.690
You can't be so careless.
You know?

1204
00:54:19.790 --> 00:54:21.526
Especially not when I'm about
to beat his rushing record

1205
00:54:21.626 --> 00:54:22.927
and we're about to
make the playoffs.

1206
00:54:23.027 --> 00:54:24.895
I know. I know.

1207
00:54:27.064 --> 00:54:29.133
All right.

1208
00:54:29.967 --> 00:54:31.669
But also, I was thinking...

1209
00:54:32.770 --> 00:54:36.073
Maybe we should chill on
the whole Madden thing.

1210
00:54:36.173 --> 00:54:37.542
What do you mean the
whole Madden thing?

1211
00:54:37.642 --> 00:54:38.643
What are you talking about?

1212
00:54:38.743 --> 00:54:39.944
I just think it's
too much right now.

1213
00:54:40.044 --> 00:54:41.646
And with nationals
and everything, I...

1214
00:54:41.746 --> 00:54:44.214
I think I need to
focus on robotics.

1215
00:54:44.315 --> 00:54:48.252
Callie, robotics?
I got a shot at the Super Bowl.

1216
00:54:48.353 --> 00:54:52.156
You know what that means?
That means a bigger house.

1217
00:54:52.256 --> 00:54:53.691
A nice pool. A shed.

1218
00:54:53.791 --> 00:54:55.159
We can build a
whole shed for you to do

1219
00:54:55.259 --> 00:54:58.463
all the robot building
you could ever wanna do.

1220
00:54:58.563 --> 00:55:00.631
It's great news for all of us.

1221
00:55:00.731 --> 00:55:05.169
Hey, check it out. Look.

1222
00:55:05.269 --> 00:55:06.837
Your dad's on TV again!

1223
00:55:06.937 --> 00:55:09.340
Everybody keeps asking
me what my secret is.

1224
00:55:09.440 --> 00:55:10.808
There's no secret.

1225
00:55:10.908 --> 00:55:13.210
What's up, big man?
That's it! Hard work!

1226
00:55:13.310 --> 00:55:14.412
My hard work!

1227
00:55:14.512 --> 00:55:16.013
That's all there is to it!

1228
00:55:16.113 --> 00:55:19.149
You tell 'em, Bobby Coleman.
That's what I told them.

1229
00:55:19.249 --> 00:55:21.952
That's my secret.

1230
00:55:22.052 --> 00:55:24.789
Can we--can we at
least tell Mom?

1231
00:55:24.889 --> 00:55:26.557
She almost caught me while
I was juggling helping you

1232
00:55:26.657 --> 00:55:28.092
and trying to win regionals.

1233
00:55:28.192 --> 00:55:30.428
I'm sure your mama didn't
think twice about it, Callie.

1234
00:55:30.528 --> 00:55:33.030
-You know your mother.

1235
00:55:33.130 --> 00:55:35.800
- What's the problem?
-I'm starting to feel guilty.

1236
00:55:35.900 --> 00:55:37.968
I mean, look at us.
We're lying.

1237
00:55:38.068 --> 00:55:41.839
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, hey.
Hey. Come on, now.

1238
00:55:41.939 --> 00:55:43.974
I'm having a moment in my life.
We all are!

1239
00:55:44.074 --> 00:55:46.477
And for once, hey,
baby girl, for once,

1240
00:55:46.577 --> 00:55:50.981
I'm finally living up
to that thing, huh?

1241
00:55:51.081 --> 00:55:52.617
So let's not go
rock the boat now.

1242
00:55:52.717 --> 00:55:54.419
No, no, no, Just keep
doing what you're doing,

1243
00:55:54.519 --> 00:55:55.853
and you're doing it great.

1244
00:55:55.953 --> 00:55:58.589
Everything will be
just fine, okay?

1245
00:55:58.689 --> 00:56:00.725
Okay.

1246
00:56:00.825 --> 00:56:02.092
Easy for you.
I'm the one doing it.

1247
00:56:02.192 --> 00:56:03.861
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
hey, hey, Callie,

1248
00:56:03.961 --> 00:56:06.063
I'm actually on the field
getting the job done.

1249
00:56:06.163 --> 00:56:08.399
You're just pressing
some buttons a little.

1250
00:56:09.934 --> 00:56:11.836
Just pressing some buttons?
A little?

1251
00:56:13.237 --> 00:56:14.304
Babe!

1252
00:56:14.405 --> 00:56:19.309
I just hit a million followers!
Ha!

1253
00:56:23.448 --> 00:56:25.850
The Las Vegas Raiders
have made the trek east

1254
00:56:25.950 --> 00:56:28.118
to take on the Atlanta Falcons

1255
00:56:28.218 --> 00:56:30.821
in a game that is
pivotal for each side

1256
00:56:30.921 --> 00:56:34.659
and just huge for the
Falcons' playoff chances.

1257
00:56:34.759 --> 00:56:36.226
Well, they're
going up against

1258
00:56:36.326 --> 00:56:37.828
one of the teams that people
recognize around football

1259
00:56:37.928 --> 00:56:40.531
as one of the toughest
teams in the league.

1260
00:56:40.631 --> 00:56:43.333
So we'll see how
good the Falcons are.

1261
00:56:43.434 --> 00:56:45.870
And the Falcons get the
job done on their home turf

1262
00:56:45.970 --> 00:56:48.005
at Mercedes-Benz Stadium.

1263
00:56:48.105 --> 00:56:49.640
They know they have
to get this one.

1264
00:56:49.740 --> 00:56:51.008
Can they do it?

1265
00:56:51.108 --> 00:56:53.744
Taylor hands off to
Coleman, who--whoa!

1266
00:56:53.844 --> 00:56:55.546
What is he doing?

1267
00:56:55.646 --> 00:56:57.247
What is circling
inside of his head?

1268
00:56:57.347 --> 00:56:58.549
What is going on?

1269
00:56:58.649 --> 00:56:59.850
That's a
great question, Jim.

1270
00:56:59.950 --> 00:57:01.151
We're all actually
asking that because

1271
00:57:01.251 --> 00:57:02.687
Coleman is just running
around in circles.

1272
00:57:02.787 --> 00:57:03.821
Stop messing around!

1273
00:57:03.921 --> 00:57:04.755
This is bizarre.

1274
00:57:04.855 --> 00:57:06.423
He's just lost.

1275
00:57:06.524 --> 00:57:09.293
And still running in circles,
going absolutely nowhere.

1276
00:57:09.393 --> 00:57:10.661
Hold on a second.

1277
00:57:10.761 --> 00:57:12.362
It looks like
he's changed course.

1278
00:57:12.463 --> 00:57:14.732
Now he's headed directly
for the sidelines.

1279
00:57:14.832 --> 00:57:18.368
What a strange way for
him to start the game.

1280
00:57:18.469 --> 00:57:20.204
What is he doing now, Jim?

1281
00:57:20.304 --> 00:57:23.007
Tony, he's lost his mind.
He's just jumping around.

1282
00:57:23.107 --> 00:57:25.075
Coleman is completely out of it.

1283
00:57:25.175 --> 00:57:27.444
I don't think jumping
around is going to help.

1284
00:57:28.579 --> 00:57:29.379
He passes the ball.

1285
00:57:29.480 --> 00:57:30.314
Come on--

1286
00:57:30.414 --> 00:57:31.381
Oh!

1287
00:57:31.482 --> 00:57:33.083
Right in the face!

1288
00:57:33.183 --> 00:57:34.585
Coach Evans!

1289
00:57:34.685 --> 00:57:37.788
I think the only one
amused there is Anderson Fisher.

1290
00:57:37.888 --> 00:57:39.256
Exactly.

1291
00:57:39.356 --> 00:57:41.391
This isn't funny.
He's out of--

1292
00:57:41.492 --> 00:57:43.060
Right now he's doing the Worm.

1293
00:57:43.160 --> 00:57:46.664
I mean, there's a ground game,
and then there's a ground game.

1294
00:57:46.764 --> 00:57:48.833
But you don't do the Worm.

1295
00:57:48.933 --> 00:57:51.401
To be precise,
it's on the 46th yard line.

1296
00:57:51.502 --> 00:57:53.370
He's being ridiculous.

1297
00:57:53.470 --> 00:57:55.305
Hey, Fish time, baby!

1298
00:57:55.405 --> 00:57:56.541
Way to go, Dad!

1299
00:57:56.641 --> 00:57:58.008
I don't know
what's happened.

1300
00:57:58.108 --> 00:57:59.877
This is not the same guy
we've seen all season long.

1301
00:57:59.977 --> 00:58:01.579
I'm ready to
call it, partner.

1302
00:58:01.679 --> 00:58:04.048
That was definitely one of
the dumbest things I've seen

1303
00:58:04.148 --> 00:58:05.550
on a football field.

1304
00:58:05.650 --> 00:58:07.752
And that will bring
an end to the first quarter,

1305
00:58:07.852 --> 00:58:10.320
which has been
downright memorable

1306
00:58:10.420 --> 00:58:12.022
for all the wrong reasons.

1307
00:58:12.823 --> 00:58:14.825
Hey, Dad!
How's the game going?

1308
00:58:14.925 --> 00:58:16.460
Callie, what are you doing?

1309
00:58:16.561 --> 00:58:17.562
What do you mean?

1310
00:58:17.662 --> 00:58:18.996
You're the one doing everything!

1311
00:58:19.096 --> 00:58:21.065
I'm pressing some buttons
to help out a little, right?

1312
00:58:21.165 --> 00:58:22.800
Okay, okay, you made your point.

1313
00:58:22.900 --> 00:58:24.835
We can talk about it
when I get home.

1314
00:58:24.935 --> 00:58:26.236
Now I need you
to turn my play around

1315
00:58:26.336 --> 00:58:28.639
so Anderson don't replace me.
Please.

1316
00:58:28.739 --> 00:58:32.409
Mm, but have you
learned your lesson?

1317
00:58:32.509 --> 00:58:34.478
Coleman! Come on.

1318
00:58:34.579 --> 00:58:36.213
Coming, Coach!
Get my helmet.

1319
00:58:36.313 --> 00:58:38.783
Lesson learned, all right?
Okay, thanks, bye.

1320
00:58:45.355 --> 00:58:46.724
Okay.

1321
00:58:56.266 --> 00:58:57.868
Uh oh.

1322
00:59:00.470 --> 00:59:01.706
Hi.

1323
00:59:01.806 --> 00:59:03.473
Callie...

1324
00:59:03.574 --> 00:59:04.875
We've been talking.

1325
00:59:04.975 --> 00:59:07.444
And with nationals in a week...

1326
00:59:07.544 --> 00:59:08.713
Screw lead-ins.

1327
00:59:08.813 --> 00:59:10.748
You promised us a new robot arm.

1328
00:59:10.848 --> 00:59:12.617
You called it SpongeBot 2.0,

1329
00:59:12.717 --> 00:59:14.719
and yet we haven't seen
anything.

1330
00:59:14.819 --> 00:59:15.953
Well, I mean, it's just taking

1331
00:59:16.053 --> 00:59:18.288
a little bit of
extra time, that's all.

1332
00:59:18.388 --> 00:59:20.024
Everything is coming
together, though.

1333
00:59:20.124 --> 00:59:21.726
I'm just working on it at home.

1334
00:59:21.826 --> 00:59:25.630
Nate knows! Right, Nate?

1335
00:59:25.730 --> 00:59:26.964
Actually, I don't.

1336
00:59:27.064 --> 00:59:29.266
I mean, you can show
us now, if you want.

1337
00:59:29.366 --> 00:59:31.902
Um...

1338
00:59:33.704 --> 00:59:35.339
Okay, well...

1339
00:59:36.807 --> 00:59:39.276
The truth is...
I haven't finished it yet

1340
00:59:40.110 --> 00:59:41.478
because I haven't
started it yet.

1341
00:59:41.578 --> 00:59:43.080
You haven't started it yet?

1342
00:59:43.180 --> 00:59:45.215
Callie, we
were counting on you.

1343
00:59:45.315 --> 00:59:47.852
We didn't work on it
because you said you would.

1344
00:59:47.952 --> 00:59:50.621
Without your changes,
we will be too far behind

1345
00:59:50.721 --> 00:59:51.989
and laughed out of nationals.

1346
00:59:52.089 --> 00:59:53.758
Like, laughed at,
not laughed with.

1347
00:59:53.858 --> 00:59:55.125
I know, it's just, look,

1348
00:59:55.225 --> 00:59:56.994
everything has been crazy
right now with my dad--

1349
00:59:57.094 --> 01:00:00.064
Look, look, stop
with this dad stuff.

1350
01:00:00.164 --> 01:00:02.399
We're not mad at him.
We're mad at you.

1351
01:00:02.499 --> 01:00:04.034
And what happened to
wanting to be Callie Coleman

1352
01:00:04.134 --> 01:00:06.370
and not Bobby Coleman's
daughter?

1353
01:00:06.470 --> 01:00:08.572
You might not
need these scholarships

1354
01:00:08.673 --> 01:00:11.876
because your dad is a
big, famous football player,

1355
01:00:11.976 --> 01:00:13.410
but for some of us,

1356
01:00:13.510 --> 01:00:16.280
that money could actually
make a huge difference!

1357
01:00:16.380 --> 01:00:18.482
I'm gonna need
that iPhone case back.

1358
01:00:18.582 --> 01:00:20.217
And the T-shirt too.

1359
01:00:20.317 --> 01:00:22.887
I didn't know my amazing
craftsmanship would go to waste.

1360
01:00:29.559 --> 01:00:31.696
Fine.

1361
01:00:31.796 --> 01:00:33.898
But maybe, if
anyone actually knew

1362
01:00:33.998 --> 01:00:35.532
what they were
doing on this team,

1363
01:00:35.632 --> 01:00:38.903
this wouldn't be a problem!

1364
01:00:40.137 --> 01:00:43.273
Too smart for this
mediocre crew anyways!

1365
01:00:57.187 --> 01:00:58.422
And then there were
the Falcons, right?

1366
01:00:58.522 --> 01:01:01.225
There is no
better story in the NFC

1367
01:01:01.325 --> 01:01:03.560
than Bobby "Comeback" Coleman.

1368
01:01:03.660 --> 01:01:05.195
He ain't all that.

1369
01:01:05.295 --> 01:01:07.397
-- with a record-tying
six touchdown game.

1370
01:01:07.497 --> 01:01:09.934
And now?
He's on the verge of breaking

1371
01:01:10.034 --> 01:01:11.969
the single-season
rushing record.

1372
01:01:12.069 --> 01:01:15.239
Yeah...
I did it first.

1373
01:01:15.339 --> 01:01:16.941
I mean, you just wanna
root for this guy, right?

1374
01:01:17.041 --> 01:01:19.043
Especially when you see
him with his daughter.

1375
01:01:19.143 --> 01:01:20.878
Those two make quite the couple.

1376
01:01:20.978 --> 01:01:22.179
Oh, it's adorable.

1377
01:01:22.279 --> 01:01:23.914
But, you know,
just been hanging out,

1378
01:01:24.014 --> 01:01:25.716
playing a whole lot of Madden.

1379
01:01:25.816 --> 01:01:27.918
Man, I love that
they play Madden together.

1380
01:01:28.018 --> 01:01:29.319
The way Bobby's been playing,

1381
01:01:29.419 --> 01:01:32.256
it seems he's leveled up
in real life.

1382
01:01:32.356 --> 01:01:34.324
It does seem like
that, doesn't it?

1383
01:01:34.424 --> 01:01:35.926
...but he might be getting

1384
01:01:36.026 --> 01:01:37.294
a little nervous out there,
if I were him.

1385
01:01:37.394 --> 01:01:38.829
Bobby Coleman's been
toting that rock.

1386
01:01:38.929 --> 01:01:40.530
It's like
Anderson who, right?

1387
01:01:52.276 --> 01:01:54.678
That's her exact same schedule.

1388
01:02:02.586 --> 01:02:04.054
Hold up.

1389
01:02:19.770 --> 01:02:22.272
Those are the exact same plays.

1390
01:02:32.983 --> 01:02:34.584
That's crazy, no.

1391
01:02:51.701 --> 01:02:53.070
Thank you.

1392
01:02:53.170 --> 01:02:55.873
Callie!

1393
01:02:55.973 --> 01:02:58.775
-We're home!
-We brought you some food!

1394
01:03:00.510 --> 01:03:01.745
Where is she?

1395
01:03:01.846 --> 01:03:03.480
-I'll check on her.
-Okay.

1396
01:03:03.580 --> 01:03:05.382
All right.

1397
01:03:11.321 --> 01:03:12.789
Oh, baby girl,
we got dinner down--

1398
01:03:14.424 --> 01:03:15.792
Callie, what are you doing?

1399
01:03:17.394 --> 01:03:18.662
Put the controller down now.

1400
01:03:18.762 --> 01:03:20.430
I finally felt like
I belonged somewhere

1401
01:03:20.530 --> 01:03:23.067
and now all my friends hate me.

1402
01:03:23.167 --> 01:03:24.501
What are you talking about?

1403
01:03:26.103 --> 01:03:28.172
This game ruined my life.

1404
01:03:28.272 --> 01:03:30.607
Callie, we're dominating!
You're kidding me?

1405
01:03:30.707 --> 01:03:32.576
I'm having the best
season of my career!

1406
01:03:32.676 --> 01:03:33.878
And I'm having the worst!

1407
01:03:33.978 --> 01:03:36.914
Isn't there something
wrong with that?

1408
01:03:37.014 --> 01:03:39.316
Callie, think about
what you're doing.

1409
01:03:41.785 --> 01:03:43.687
No, no, no, no, no, no!

1410
01:03:53.563 --> 01:03:55.699
No. No.

1411
01:03:57.234 --> 01:03:58.969
What are you doing?

1412
01:03:59.069 --> 01:04:00.337
Gotta go to Best Buy, right?

1413
01:04:00.437 --> 01:04:02.539
They--they--they
can recover the data.

1414
01:04:02.639 --> 01:04:05.342
Geek Squad, don't fail me now.
That whole thing?

1415
01:04:06.410 --> 01:04:08.212
Come on, leave it alone!

1416
01:04:11.315 --> 01:04:14.751
Don't--Dad, what are you doing?
It's over! It's over!

1417
01:04:16.053 --> 01:04:18.288
-Dad, look, stop!
-Hey!

1418
01:04:18.388 --> 01:04:21.458
You're not gonna get it back.
It's gone, it's gone!

1419
01:04:21.558 --> 01:04:25.495
No, Callie, I'm taking it!
Give me the game!

1420
01:04:25.595 --> 01:04:26.563
Callie, Callie!

1421
01:04:26.663 --> 01:04:28.632
I wish none of this
had ever happened!

1422
01:04:34.638 --> 01:04:37.674
You guys are insane!
What is going on with you two?

1423
01:04:38.742 --> 01:04:41.678
-Is this about that video game?
-No, it's not just the game.

1424
01:04:41.778 --> 01:04:44.314
What she really means is more
of a metaphor, right Callie?

1425
01:04:44.414 --> 01:04:46.750
No!

1426
01:04:46.850 --> 01:04:50.854
This game has some sort of
weird body controlling thing.

1427
01:04:50.955 --> 01:04:52.556
Please feel free
to expand on that.

1428
01:04:52.656 --> 01:04:55.392
Mom, whatever I do in the game,
it happens in real life.

1429
01:04:55.492 --> 01:04:58.162
That's the reason
Dad's been playing so well!

1430
01:05:02.899 --> 01:05:05.435
Callie Amber Coleman,
is that what you think?

1431
01:05:05.535 --> 01:05:08.438
It's true. It's true, Keish.

1432
01:05:10.007 --> 01:05:11.408
I know it does sound insane,

1433
01:05:11.508 --> 01:05:14.344
but the game has some
sort of power over me.

1434
01:05:14.444 --> 01:05:16.513
Or at least, it used to.

1435
01:05:16.613 --> 01:05:18.949
-And now I got nothin'!
-Excuse me?

1436
01:05:19.049 --> 01:05:20.384
Your daughter and
I are not nothin'.

1437
01:05:20.484 --> 01:05:21.885
But we'll come back to that.

1438
01:05:21.986 --> 01:05:24.288
Because what I just heard
come out of both of your faces

1439
01:05:24.388 --> 01:05:27.191
is that whatever Callie
does in a video game,

1440
01:05:27.291 --> 01:05:28.825
Bobby mirrors on the
field move for move.

1441
01:05:28.925 --> 01:05:31.228
Is that correct?

1442
01:05:31.328 --> 01:05:33.530
And you two aren't
messing with me?

1443
01:05:36.500 --> 01:05:38.302
How could you two keep
something like this a secret?

1444
01:05:38.402 --> 01:05:39.736
Mom, I'm sorry, I
wanted to tell you,

1445
01:05:39.836 --> 01:05:41.071
but Dad said not to--

1446
01:05:41.171 --> 01:05:42.639
Wait, wait, wait,
you're sorry about that?

1447
01:05:42.739 --> 01:05:46.043
How 'bout the fact that you just
made all of my skills disappear?

1448
01:05:46.143 --> 01:05:48.212
Gone, poof, just like that!

1449
01:05:48.312 --> 01:05:50.347
And right before the
playoffs are about to start?

1450
01:05:50.447 --> 01:05:52.549
And by the way, I was about
to break the rushing record.

1451
01:05:52.649 --> 01:05:55.752
That's literally
all you care about!

1452
01:05:56.853 --> 01:05:59.523
Callie...
Baby girl...

1453
01:05:59.623 --> 01:06:01.225
This was a win/win
for both of us.

1454
01:06:01.325 --> 01:06:02.692
And all our dreams
were finally coming true.

1455
01:06:02.792 --> 01:06:04.628
Your dreams!

1456
01:06:04.728 --> 01:06:07.131
But what about me?

1457
01:06:07.231 --> 01:06:09.166
I was finally starting
to become my own person!

1458
01:06:09.266 --> 01:06:11.735
Not everything
is just about you!

1459
01:06:15.272 --> 01:06:18.808
You told our daughter
to lie to me?

1460
01:06:18.908 --> 01:06:20.277
-Listen, Keisha...
-No.

1461
01:06:20.377 --> 01:06:22.446
You don't get to talk right now.

1462
01:06:22.546 --> 01:06:24.414
What happened to
us being a unit?

1463
01:06:24.514 --> 01:06:27.051
I mean, I get it.
You're Mr. Bigshot on the field.

1464
01:06:27.151 --> 01:06:31.621
But in this house?
We're partners.

1465
01:06:31.721 --> 01:06:35.759
And right now...it sure
doesn't feel that way.

1466
01:06:35.859 --> 01:06:37.661
-I mean, Keisha--
-No.

1467
01:06:37.761 --> 01:06:39.496
Callie!

1468
01:06:50.074 --> 01:06:51.908
* Yeah, well you the GOAT

1469
01:06:53.410 --> 01:06:57.414
Hey, first game of the playoffs,
baby, let's go!

1470
01:06:57.514 --> 01:07:00.550
Hey, you ready to bring some
of that Bobby Coleman action?

1471
01:07:00.650 --> 01:07:02.452
You know it!
You know it!

1472
01:07:10.294 --> 01:07:12.662
Coleman!

1473
01:07:12.762 --> 01:07:14.331
Where's Bobby?

1474
01:07:14.431 --> 01:07:17.167
-Coleman, there you are.
- That sweater is terrible!

1475
01:07:17.267 --> 01:07:19.035
I know your secret.

1476
01:07:19.136 --> 01:07:21.771
I know all about what you and
your little daughter been up to.

1477
01:07:21.871 --> 01:07:22.706
Check it out, Joe.

1478
01:07:22.806 --> 01:07:24.108
When his daughter plays Madden,

1479
01:07:24.208 --> 01:07:25.975
it makes him good
at actual football.

1480
01:07:26.076 --> 01:07:28.512
Everything she does on the
game he does on the field.

1481
01:07:28.612 --> 01:07:30.314
Yo, no offense, but what?

1482
01:07:30.414 --> 01:07:32.549
Look, I don't know
how you're doing it,

1483
01:07:32.649 --> 01:07:35.018
but I got proof.
I got proof!

1484
01:07:35.119 --> 01:07:36.953
His daughter recorded
her Madden gameplay,

1485
01:07:37.053 --> 01:07:39.256
and it was exactly the same
as his six-touchdown game

1486
01:07:39.356 --> 01:07:41.258
a few months back.

1487
01:07:41.358 --> 01:07:42.759
-Hey, I just leveled up!
-Scoot over.

1488
01:07:42.859 --> 01:07:45.629
- Come on, now!
- What you doin'?

1489
01:07:45.729 --> 01:07:46.696
Give the controller back.

1490
01:07:49.166 --> 01:07:51.101
What's wrong, man?

1491
01:07:51.201 --> 01:07:52.436
What you doin'?

1492
01:07:53.069 --> 01:07:55.071
What?

1493
01:07:55.639 --> 01:07:57.441
No, no. Where is it?

1494
01:07:57.541 --> 01:07:59.109
No, no, it was right here.
I saw it.

1495
01:07:59.209 --> 01:08:00.744
She recorded it.

1496
01:08:00.844 --> 01:08:03.747
Look, y'all remember when
he had that six-touchdown game.

1497
01:08:03.847 --> 01:08:05.849
Right? It was the same on
Madden , too!

1498
01:08:08.285 --> 01:08:11.020
Admit it, Bobby!

1499
01:08:11.121 --> 01:08:12.556
You and that daughter of yours?

1500
01:08:12.656 --> 01:08:14.858
Y'all made some kind of deal
with a real-life game genie.

1501
01:08:14.958 --> 01:08:16.826
Boom! Busted!

1502
01:08:36.746 --> 01:08:41.017
Wake up, fam!

1503
01:08:41.117 --> 01:08:42.752
In, like, one day he
went from rickety old man

1504
01:08:42.852 --> 01:08:44.854
to some kind of
superhero overnight?

1505
01:08:44.954 --> 01:08:47.457
What do you think caused that?
Multivitamins?

1506
01:08:47.557 --> 01:08:49.293
I think not.
You know what it was?

1507
01:08:49.393 --> 01:08:51.361
It was his magical video game.

1508
01:08:51.461 --> 01:08:53.463
That's right, Bobby.
I figured it out.

1509
01:08:53.563 --> 01:08:55.865
-I got my butt back.
-You got your butt back?

1510
01:08:55.965 --> 01:08:57.000
It's a Gen Z thing.

1511
01:08:57.100 --> 01:08:59.569
Hey, hey.

1512
01:08:59.669 --> 01:09:01.238
Why don't we just play football?

1513
01:09:01.338 --> 01:09:03.273
Right, AF?

1514
01:09:03.373 --> 01:09:04.574
Just play ball.

1515
01:09:04.674 --> 01:09:06.376
'Cause you sound crazy.

1516
01:09:06.476 --> 01:09:07.644
-I'm not crazy, y'all.
- You sound crazy.

1517
01:09:07.744 --> 01:09:10.079
I'm not crazy.
I'm not going insane.

1518
01:09:10.180 --> 01:09:11.315
It was on the game!

1519
01:09:11.415 --> 01:09:13.950
Man, shut up!
I'm with Bobby.

1520
01:09:15.585 --> 01:09:17.187
That boy crazy, man.

1521
01:09:19.256 --> 01:09:21.425
-Let's focus up.
-It's on the game.

1522
01:09:24.394 --> 01:09:25.829
Yeeeaahhh!

1523
01:09:28.565 --> 01:09:30.033
It's starting,
if you wanna watch!

1524
01:09:30.133 --> 01:09:31.735
I'm good!

1525
01:09:32.236 --> 01:09:33.603
Taylor, the quarterback.

1526
01:09:33.703 --> 01:09:35.439
Coleman in the back field.

1527
01:09:35.539 --> 01:09:37.341
And they'll hand it off
to Coleman.

1528
01:09:37.441 --> 01:09:39.643
Oh! He fumbles right away.

1529
01:09:39.743 --> 01:09:42.512
But the Falcons do
keep possession.

1530
01:09:42.612 --> 01:09:43.847
Now they throw it to Coleman.

1531
01:09:43.947 --> 01:09:45.782
And it goes directly
through his hands.

1532
01:09:45.882 --> 01:09:47.251
Bobby!

1533
01:09:47.351 --> 01:09:49.486
Jim, as I suspected,
Bobby Coleman's going out

1534
01:09:49.586 --> 01:09:51.655
and Anderson Fisher's coming in.

1535
01:09:51.755 --> 01:09:53.156
You can't blame him.

1536
01:09:53.257 --> 01:09:55.392
Coleman just doesn't
look like himself out there.

1537
01:09:55.492 --> 01:09:56.593
Yeah, well,
technically, Jim,

1538
01:09:56.693 --> 01:09:58.262
he hasn't looked
like himself all season.

1539
01:09:58.362 --> 01:09:59.929
I mean, he started off on fire.

1540
01:10:00.029 --> 01:10:02.832
But today we saw him revert
back to that fumble-throwing guy

1541
01:10:02.932 --> 01:10:05.335
that we've seen throughout
most of his NFL career.

1542
01:10:05.435 --> 01:10:08.004
Isn't this the worst?

1543
01:10:08.104 --> 01:10:09.439
What?

1544
01:10:09.539 --> 01:10:11.275
Feeling bad for
someone you're mad at.

1545
01:10:11.375 --> 01:10:12.976
Takes all the fun out of it.

1546
01:10:13.076 --> 01:10:16.079
I mean, no matter how
angry I get at that man--

1547
01:10:16.179 --> 01:10:19.416
and he can test me--

1548
01:10:19.516 --> 01:10:21.818
I never wanna see him struggle.

1549
01:10:21.918 --> 01:10:25.989
And we both know
he's had his struggles.

1550
01:10:26.089 --> 01:10:29.426
But that's the thing
about loving someone.

1551
01:10:29.526 --> 01:10:33.530
You never stop rooting for them.

1552
01:10:42.071 --> 01:10:43.473
Thanks to Anderson Fisher,

1553
01:10:43.573 --> 01:10:45.275
the Falcons were able
to eke out the win today

1554
01:10:45.375 --> 01:10:46.510
to keep their season alive.

1555
01:10:46.610 --> 01:10:47.844
Man, but how about
Bobby Coleman?

1556
01:10:47.944 --> 01:10:49.313
Looks like his
so-called resurgence

1557
01:10:49.413 --> 01:10:50.514
was just a fluke.

1558
01:10:50.614 --> 01:10:51.581
Pathetic!

1559
01:10:51.681 --> 01:10:53.583
I say just retire.

1560
01:10:56.420 --> 01:10:59.155
Keisha?
Look, I apologize--

1561
01:10:59.255 --> 01:11:00.690
Not now.
I can't find Callie.

1562
01:11:00.790 --> 01:11:02.392
She left after the game and
she hasn't answered her phone

1563
01:11:02.492 --> 01:11:03.560
for two hours.

1564
01:11:03.660 --> 01:11:05.061
Has she mentioned any plans?

1565
01:11:05.161 --> 01:11:06.930
No, she's got that robotics
competition thing coming up

1566
01:11:07.030 --> 01:11:08.798
and she might be at
the school, but let's go.

1567
01:11:08.898 --> 01:11:10.099
Okay.

1568
01:11:15.705 --> 01:11:18.775
Excuse me? Hi.
We're Callie's parents.

1569
01:11:18.875 --> 01:11:20.877
Oh yeah, we met at your
house the other day, right?

1570
01:11:20.977 --> 01:11:22.546
Wait, he was at our house?
When was this?

1571
01:11:22.646 --> 01:11:24.180
Not now, not now.
We're looking for Callie.

1572
01:11:24.280 --> 01:11:29.353
Uh, we kind of had to
kick her off of the team.

1573
01:11:29.453 --> 01:11:32.055
Wait, why?
She loves it so much.

1574
01:11:32.155 --> 01:11:33.790
Yeah, see, she was
supposed to figure out

1575
01:11:33.890 --> 01:11:36.393
this big element
of our robot, but--

1576
01:11:36.493 --> 01:11:38.027
no offense to Mr. Coleman--

1577
01:11:38.127 --> 01:11:40.864
she was so consumed
by your success

1578
01:11:40.964 --> 01:11:46.269
that she didn't really
have much time left for us.

1579
01:11:46.370 --> 01:11:48.338
And she's super good.
I mean, she the whole reason

1580
01:11:48.438 --> 01:11:49.806
we even made it
to the nationals.

1581
01:11:49.906 --> 01:11:51.441
Yeah, well, now she
is the whole reason why

1582
01:11:51.541 --> 01:11:54.478
we are completely screwed.

1583
01:11:54.578 --> 01:11:56.713
Uh, sorry for the language.

1584
01:11:56.813 --> 01:11:59.148
It's just I don't think
we're gonna find another Callie

1585
01:11:59.248 --> 01:12:01.017
before nationals.

1586
01:12:01.117 --> 01:12:02.619
Lightning definitely
doesn't strike twice.

1587
01:12:06.055 --> 01:12:07.857
-I know where she is.
-Where?

1588
01:12:07.957 --> 01:12:09.626
Babe, I know where she is.
Thank you! Thank you!

1589
01:12:09.726 --> 01:12:11.495
And sorry.

1590
01:12:23.607 --> 01:12:24.741
Right there!
There she is.

1591
01:12:24.841 --> 01:12:26.943
What in the
world is she doing?

1592
01:12:29.479 --> 01:12:31.481
Callie! Callie!

1593
01:12:31.581 --> 01:12:33.249
Dad, please stop!

1594
01:12:33.349 --> 01:12:34.651
I'm trying to fix this!

1595
01:12:34.751 --> 01:12:36.420
All I need to do is get
struck by lightning again.

1596
01:12:36.520 --> 01:12:37.887
-Baby girl, no!
-Baby, this is insane.

1597
01:12:37.987 --> 01:12:40.590
-You're gonna get hurt!
-But it's all my fault!

1598
01:12:40.690 --> 01:12:42.526
I mean, everything was
great until I ruined it.

1599
01:12:42.626 --> 01:12:45.294
No, you said it--we're a team.

1600
01:12:45.395 --> 01:12:46.596
You didn't drop the ball.

1601
01:12:46.696 --> 01:12:48.498
I'm the one who
dropped the ball.

1602
01:12:48.598 --> 01:12:51.100
You've already given me so much.
You have!

1603
01:12:51.200 --> 01:12:52.869
And now you're
standing in the rain,

1604
01:12:52.969 --> 01:12:55.271
trying to get yourself
struck by lightning,

1605
01:12:55.371 --> 01:12:57.674
-all for me again.
-But football is your life!

1606
01:12:57.774 --> 01:13:01.845
No, baby.
No! You're my life.

1607
01:13:01.945 --> 01:13:04.213
Don't you see? It's you.

1608
01:13:04.313 --> 01:13:07.617
And you're smarter and more
talented than I could ever be.

1609
01:13:07.717 --> 01:13:09.018
You led your team to nationals!

1610
01:13:09.118 --> 01:13:10.654
Yeah, and then I
let them all down!

1611
01:13:10.754 --> 01:13:12.121
No, no, no,
that's no me too, okay?

1612
01:13:12.221 --> 01:13:14.591
I just got caught up, you
know, in all the attention.

1613
01:13:14.691 --> 01:13:16.926
I didn't think about
how it affected you.

1614
01:13:17.026 --> 01:13:18.294
Then I asked you to
lie to your mother.

1615
01:13:18.394 --> 01:13:20.630
I shouldn't have asked
you to lie to anyone.

1616
01:13:20.730 --> 01:13:26.235
So, I'm sorry, okay?
You hear me?

1617
01:13:26.335 --> 01:13:27.671
I'm sorry.

1618
01:13:28.772 --> 01:13:31.875
I'm sorry to you,
and I'm sorry to you.

1619
01:13:33.409 --> 01:13:36.245
I guess I thought that
being on top of the world

1620
01:13:36.345 --> 01:13:38.347
would mean that I could
give you both the world.

1621
01:13:38.448 --> 01:13:41.350
But really you just wanted
me right here, present.

1622
01:13:41.451 --> 01:13:44.153
So I'm here, present.

1623
01:13:45.989 --> 01:13:47.691
I mean, with the playoffs
and everything, it's just--

1624
01:13:47.791 --> 01:13:51.961
No, hey, come here, come here.
Come here.

1625
01:13:54.163 --> 01:13:57.601
It's just a game.
You get it?

1626
01:13:57.701 --> 01:14:01.304
The playoffs...
It's just a game.

1627
01:14:01.404 --> 01:14:05.775
You mean everything to me.
You and your mama.

1628
01:14:14.150 --> 01:14:15.652
We really need to
get out of this rain

1629
01:14:15.752 --> 01:14:17.086
because we're going
to get pneumonia.

1630
01:14:17.186 --> 01:14:18.087
Please come over.

1631
01:14:18.187 --> 01:14:20.990
Mom, pneumonia's
a little extreme.

1632
01:14:21.090 --> 01:14:23.159
Worst-case scenario,
it's probably just the sniffles.

1633
01:14:23.259 --> 01:14:27.096
Please, just trust me.
I am a medical professional.

1634
01:14:49.753 --> 01:14:51.521
-Good morning!
-Whoa!

1635
01:14:51.621 --> 01:14:53.757
-Ha, ha, ha.
-What's going on?

1636
01:14:53.857 --> 01:14:55.258
Let's go, let's go.
We got work to do.

1637
01:14:55.358 --> 01:14:56.626
What?

1638
01:14:56.726 --> 01:14:58.728
Come on, come on.

1639
01:14:58.828 --> 01:15:01.130
It's 6 o'clock in the
morning on a Saturday.

1640
01:15:01.230 --> 01:15:04.067
Yeah. This isn't about me.
Today is not about me.

1641
01:15:04.167 --> 01:15:05.434
-Come on!
-Dad, Dad, stop.

1642
01:15:05.535 --> 01:15:07.270
We gotta go. Hey, hey!

1643
01:15:07.370 --> 01:15:09.906
You drivin', Miss Thing.

1644
01:15:10.006 --> 01:15:12.175
That's right.
I'll see you downstairs.

1645
01:15:12.275 --> 01:15:14.210
Breakfast on the table.
Let's rock!

1646
01:15:18.648 --> 01:15:22.786
The most important game
of your career is tomorrow.

1647
01:15:22.886 --> 01:15:25.354
Are you sure you wanna
spend your day here?

1648
01:15:25.454 --> 01:15:27.557
Yeah, I do.

1649
01:15:27.657 --> 01:15:28.858
You get this thing done,

1650
01:15:28.958 --> 01:15:30.326
you guys still have
a shot at nationals.

1651
01:15:30.426 --> 01:15:33.096
I'm gonna stay here, help you as
long as it takes to get it done.

1652
01:15:33.196 --> 01:15:34.764
All right?

1653
01:15:34.864 --> 01:15:38.001
But I do have one question.

1654
01:15:38.101 --> 01:15:39.836
What is all of this stuff?

1655
01:15:39.936 --> 01:15:42.939
And, uh, how does
any of it work?

1656
01:15:43.973 --> 01:15:46.042
* Oh no, got me goin' loco

1657
01:15:46.142 --> 01:15:47.744
* Make me go berserk-o

1658
01:15:47.844 --> 01:15:49.378
* Shake it in a circle

1659
01:15:49.478 --> 01:15:50.479
* Circle

1660
01:15:50.580 --> 01:15:52.616
* Oh no, got me goin' loco

1661
01:15:52.716 --> 01:15:54.417
* Gotta put in work, though

1662
01:16:01.991 --> 01:16:02.992
* Make it work

1663
01:16:03.092 --> 01:16:04.828
* Lo--lo--lo--loco

1664
01:16:06.896 --> 01:16:08.464
Lookin' sharp.

1665
01:16:08.564 --> 01:16:10.066
* Loco

1666
01:16:11.434 --> 01:16:12.168
What's wrong?

1667
01:16:12.268 --> 01:16:17.340
Uh, there's a piece missing.

1668
01:16:17.440 --> 01:16:20.409
A small bronze cylinder
about this big here.

1669
01:16:20.509 --> 01:16:21.978
See?

1670
01:16:22.078 --> 01:16:23.479
It's supposed to be
here as a counterweight

1671
01:16:23.579 --> 01:16:25.148
for this upper joint.

1672
01:16:25.248 --> 01:16:27.116
The arm won't work without it.

1673
01:16:28.417 --> 01:16:30.219
Ah, what about this?

1674
01:16:32.288 --> 01:16:33.623
Nope.

1675
01:16:33.723 --> 01:16:35.692
See, this one is too light to
provide the torque that we need.

1676
01:16:35.792 --> 01:16:37.761
I've torqued about enough.

1677
01:16:39.595 --> 01:16:42.966
Without the counterweight,
the balance is off.

1678
01:16:43.066 --> 01:16:46.535
And you say that it's a bronze
cylinder about this big?

1679
01:16:48.905 --> 01:16:51.007
Come with me. Come on.

1680
01:16:54.778 --> 01:16:56.512
I don't think
I completely understand.

1681
01:16:56.612 --> 01:16:59.415
You want me to cut off the
arm of your Heisman Trophy?

1682
01:16:59.515 --> 01:17:01.617
Yeah, because this
young lady right here,

1683
01:17:01.718 --> 01:17:03.953
well, she matters way more to me
than some piece of metal, right?

1684
01:17:04.053 --> 01:17:06.589
So just cut that arm
right off my Heisman.

1685
01:17:06.690 --> 01:17:09.926
We got a robot to build.

1686
01:17:10.026 --> 01:17:11.761
Wow, uh, it seems like

1687
01:17:11.861 --> 01:17:14.230
I'm missing some
significant context here.

1688
01:17:14.330 --> 01:17:16.432
But we don't have to do that.

1689
01:17:16.532 --> 01:17:19.803
I can just sell you
a piece of bronze.

1690
01:17:19.903 --> 01:17:22.071
-Oh.
-I mean, is that okay?

1691
01:17:22.171 --> 01:17:23.239
I mean, that way you can have

1692
01:17:23.339 --> 01:17:24.808
your cake and eat
it too, you know?

1693
01:17:24.908 --> 01:17:26.109
-Way better.
- Okay.

1694
01:17:26.209 --> 01:17:28.111
-Way better.
-I'm gonna go get the bronze.

1695
01:17:28.211 --> 01:17:30.346
I will be back.
Don't go anywhere.

1696
01:17:30.446 --> 01:17:32.548
-Win-win.
-Yeah.

1697
01:17:37.320 --> 01:17:39.255
Um, guys!?

1698
01:17:44.160 --> 01:17:46.529
SpongeBot SpareParts!

1699
01:17:46.629 --> 01:17:49.332
Ooh, with a new arm, too.

1700
01:17:51.367 --> 01:17:52.802
Hey, it's Callie.

1701
01:17:52.902 --> 01:17:55.471
Um, I owe you an apology.

1702
01:17:55.571 --> 01:17:58.307
You were relying on me,
and I didn't deliver.

1703
01:17:58.407 --> 01:18:01.144
If you don't want me back,
I completely understand.

1704
01:18:01.244 --> 01:18:03.747
But y'all mean everything to me.

1705
01:18:03.847 --> 01:18:05.114
Either way, I want you to take

1706
01:18:05.214 --> 01:18:07.150
this finished
SpongeBot 2.0 to nationals

1707
01:18:07.250 --> 01:18:09.318
and destroy the competition,

1708
01:18:09.418 --> 01:18:13.189
and also crush, obliterate,
and annihilate them.

1709
01:18:15.825 --> 01:18:17.360
Oh, jeez.

1710
01:18:19.695 --> 01:18:20.696
-You good?
-Yeah, yeah.

1711
01:18:20.797 --> 01:18:22.065
Um...

1712
01:18:22.165 --> 01:18:23.532
That was, um...

1713
01:18:23.632 --> 01:18:25.268
That was supposed to
be a way cooler reveal.

1714
01:18:25.368 --> 01:18:28.104
Wow, hiding in a tree, yeah.
That's creepy.

1715
01:18:28.204 --> 01:18:29.405
Yeah, it's not my best look.

1716
01:18:29.505 --> 01:18:32.108
Look, I'm sorry for
the mean things I said.

1717
01:18:32.208 --> 01:18:33.877
Yeah, me too, it
got pretty brutal.

1718
01:18:33.977 --> 01:18:36.079
Yeah, and I'm sorry for, um...

1719
01:18:36.179 --> 01:18:39.215
Well, SpongeBot kind of
covered it.

1720
01:18:39.315 --> 01:18:44.320
I, uh, think these
belong to you.

1721
01:18:45.955 --> 01:18:47.323
What do you guys think?

1722
01:18:47.423 --> 01:18:48.758
Shall we see what this
little guy can do?

1723
01:18:48.858 --> 01:18:49.759
Yes!

1724
01:18:49.859 --> 01:18:51.327
Let's go!

1725
01:18:55.164 --> 01:18:57.633
Zoe, Kayla, you're up!
Go long.

1726
01:19:04.273 --> 01:19:06.309
Launch it!

1727
01:19:06.876 --> 01:19:07.777
Oh my god, Oliver!

1728
01:19:07.877 --> 01:19:09.345
So, um...

1729
01:19:09.445 --> 01:19:10.513
You were
supposed to catch it

1730
01:19:10.613 --> 01:19:12.315
so it doesn't break
our windshield!

1731
01:19:12.415 --> 01:19:13.516
Are we cool?

1732
01:19:13.616 --> 01:19:17.286
Even though I acted very
weird when you came over?

1733
01:19:17.386 --> 01:19:19.688
-Yeah, we cool.
-Okay.

1734
01:19:19.789 --> 01:19:23.326
And for the record...

1735
01:19:23.426 --> 01:19:26.195
you being incredibly weird
is the reason I like you.

1736
01:19:29.498 --> 01:19:31.267
Callie!

1737
01:19:32.135 --> 01:19:34.203
Uh, I'ma head home, all right?

1738
01:19:34.303 --> 01:19:37.006
You stay and enjoy your friends.

1739
01:19:37.106 --> 01:19:39.642
And the car is
yours for the day.

1740
01:19:39.742 --> 01:19:41.644
Thank you!

1741
01:19:45.248 --> 01:19:47.483
Your mom just pulled up
to pick me up.

1742
01:19:47.583 --> 01:19:48.717
And be safe.

1743
01:19:50.086 --> 01:19:51.855
-Hey!
-Hey.

1744
01:19:51.955 --> 01:19:54.390
I'm Nate.

1745
01:19:54.490 --> 01:19:58.194
Nathaniel? Nate.

1746
01:19:58.294 --> 01:20:01.164
You can call me Nathaniel.

1747
01:20:01.264 --> 01:20:03.499
We didn't really actually
get a chance to meet?

1748
01:20:03.599 --> 01:20:05.668
I just wanted to let you know
that it's been a pleasure

1749
01:20:05.768 --> 01:20:07.937
-being with your daughter.
-Ooh, say what?

1750
01:20:08.037 --> 01:20:13.576
Um, uh, having contact with
her--interpersonally, though.

1751
01:20:13.676 --> 01:20:15.811
Because of robotics?

1752
01:20:15.912 --> 01:20:17.013
Yeah, because of robotics.

1753
01:20:17.113 --> 01:20:20.249
Robotics.

1754
01:20:20.349 --> 01:20:24.687
Look, it's an honor to
meet you, Mr. Bobby, Robert...

1755
01:20:24.787 --> 01:20:27.023
-Mr. Coleman is perfect.
-Right, Mr. Coleman.

1756
01:20:27.123 --> 01:20:29.458
-Mr. Coleman.
-Yeah.

1757
01:20:29.558 --> 01:20:31.427
Well, thank you, Nate.

1758
01:20:31.527 --> 01:20:32.962
Pleasure to meet
you too, young man.

1759
01:20:33.062 --> 01:20:37.700
And remember, I
got my eye on you.

1760
01:20:37.800 --> 01:20:38.734
-Right.
-Right.

1761
01:20:38.834 --> 01:20:40.636
Right.

1762
01:20:41.204 --> 01:20:42.505
* Are you ready?

1763
01:20:42.605 --> 01:20:44.307
Jim, the energy
here at Mercedes-Benz

1764
01:20:44.407 --> 01:20:46.275
is electric.
A sold-out crowd

1765
01:20:46.375 --> 01:20:48.377
is hoping to see their Falcons

1766
01:20:48.477 --> 01:20:50.213
punch their ticket
to the Super Bowl.

1767
01:20:50.313 --> 01:20:51.881
But they gotta go through
the Saints here today.

1768
01:20:51.981 --> 01:20:52.949
That's right, partner.

1769
01:20:53.049 --> 01:20:54.750
And all eyes are
on Bobby Coleman,

1770
01:20:54.850 --> 01:20:57.286
who's had the Cinderella season.

1771
01:20:57.386 --> 01:21:00.656
But he came out last game
looking like Sleeping Beauty.

1772
01:21:00.756 --> 01:21:02.391
Yes, but even after
that performance,

1773
01:21:02.491 --> 01:21:05.161
he's still just 45 yards
away from overtaking

1774
01:21:05.261 --> 01:21:08.264
Anderson Fisher's
single-season rushing record.

1775
01:21:08.364 --> 01:21:10.033
But the big question
is, will Coach Evans

1776
01:21:10.133 --> 01:21:12.135
give him the minutes
he needs to do it?

1777
01:21:12.235 --> 01:21:15.138
-These seats are incredible!
-Okay.

1778
01:21:15.238 --> 01:21:18.107
-You do this every Sunday?
-Um...

1779
01:21:18.207 --> 01:21:20.043
This season's been
a little different.

1780
01:21:20.143 --> 01:21:22.979
Yo, I'll take a dog!
Oh, dog, you want a dog?

1781
01:21:23.079 --> 01:21:24.747
Make that double dog!
With kraut.

1782
01:21:24.847 --> 01:21:28.484
Everybody gets a sign.

1783
01:21:28.851 --> 01:21:31.420
Callie, you are
the exclamation point.

1784
01:21:31.520 --> 01:21:33.156
Oh, Ms. Coleman, I'm sorry.

1785
01:21:33.256 --> 01:21:34.423
I should've
brought you one too.

1786
01:21:34.523 --> 01:21:35.691
It's okay, honey.

1787
01:21:35.791 --> 01:21:38.627
I consider myself a
human exclamation point.

1788
01:21:38.727 --> 01:21:40.263
Okay.

1789
01:21:40.363 --> 01:21:44.633
And the NFC
championship game is underway.

1790
01:21:44.733 --> 01:21:47.036
And this will go
for a touchback.

1791
01:21:47.136 --> 01:21:48.337
Signs up! Signs up!

1792
01:21:51.240 --> 01:21:52.608
Come on, Bobby!

1793
01:21:52.708 --> 01:21:54.810
Coach Evans going
with Bobby Coleman.

1794
01:21:54.910 --> 01:21:57.480
Wow, I can't believe
it, but I love it.

1795
01:22:02.151 --> 01:22:03.987
And Coleman,
right off the bat,

1796
01:22:04.087 --> 01:22:05.821
is hit hard for a loss.

1797
01:22:06.722 --> 01:22:07.991
Well, the
Saints are not gonna

1798
01:22:08.091 --> 01:22:09.458
make this easy
for Bobby Coleman.

1799
01:22:09.558 --> 01:22:13.096
Get it together, Bobby!
They're crushing you out there!

1800
01:22:13.196 --> 01:22:15.598
-Your mom is a little...
-Passionate?

1801
01:22:15.698 --> 01:22:19.202
-I was gonna say terrifying.
-Yeah, that too.

1802
01:22:19.302 --> 01:22:23.072
And now the Saints head to
the end zone on a quick strike.

1803
01:22:23.172 --> 01:22:24.640
Taylor going deep.

1804
01:22:26.675 --> 01:22:29.278
And it's caught.
Touchdown, Falcons.

1805
01:22:29.378 --> 01:22:30.879
Taylor with
a perfect throw.

1806
01:22:30.980 --> 01:22:34.283
That's how you gotta score
against this defense.

1807
01:22:35.484 --> 01:22:38.121
Handoff, Coleman.
And he fumbles it.

1808
01:22:38.221 --> 01:22:39.888
And the Saints recover.

1809
01:22:39.989 --> 01:22:43.026
All of last week's
troubles not quite behind him.

1810
01:22:43.126 --> 01:22:44.360
And touchdown, Saints.

1811
01:22:44.460 --> 01:22:47.430
And they do the little
bowling ball!

1812
01:22:47.530 --> 01:22:50.399
Saints are feeling
comfortable in enemy territory.

1813
01:22:50.499 --> 01:22:53.902
And oh, Coleman once
again coughs it up.

1814
01:22:54.003 --> 01:22:56.305
That's it.
Coach Evans says you're done.

1815
01:22:56.405 --> 01:22:58.507
I'm going to Anderson Fisher.

1816
01:23:00.009 --> 01:23:02.611
And Fisher looking
like he did last year.

1817
01:23:02.711 --> 01:23:05.314
Into the end zone for sixth.

1818
01:23:06.415 --> 01:23:07.450
How do you handle this?

1819
01:23:07.550 --> 01:23:08.551
It's like my heart
is gonna explode!

1820
01:23:08.651 --> 01:23:09.885
You gotta let it out, man.

1821
01:23:09.985 --> 01:23:11.487
Come on, scream with me.

1822
01:23:14.423 --> 01:23:15.858
And folks, the
game is essentially

1823
01:23:15.958 --> 01:23:17.326
coming down to this.

1824
01:23:18.527 --> 01:23:22.098
One final chance
for the Falcons.

1825
01:23:22.198 --> 01:23:23.766
They're trying
to get lined up.

1826
01:23:23.866 --> 01:23:25.334
But the nerves are
here, you can tell.

1827
01:23:25.434 --> 01:23:27.536
Look at this.

1828
01:23:27.970 --> 01:23:29.572
42!

1829
01:23:29.672 --> 01:23:31.707
Now there's just
a lot of confusion.

1830
01:23:31.807 --> 01:23:34.510
And Taylor is gonna
have to take a timeout.

1831
01:23:34.610 --> 01:23:36.479
It's been a
back-and-forth battle

1832
01:23:36.579 --> 01:23:38.847
between these phenomenal teams.

1833
01:23:38.947 --> 01:23:40.849
And despite Fisher
getting more minutes,

1834
01:23:40.949 --> 01:23:43.786
Bobby Coleman has managed
to get within 10 yards

1835
01:23:43.886 --> 01:23:45.788
of that rushing record.

1836
01:23:45.888 --> 01:23:47.190
Well, Comeback
Coleman has had

1837
01:23:47.290 --> 01:23:48.891
an unbelievable season.

1838
01:23:48.991 --> 01:23:52.428
But Anderson Fisher, he seems
to be more reliable right now.

1839
01:23:56.999 --> 01:23:58.867
42!

1840
01:23:58.967 --> 01:24:00.236
Time out!

1841
01:24:01.537 --> 01:24:03.239
Zeros and ones.

1842
01:24:03.339 --> 01:24:05.141
-What?
-I've got it!

1843
01:24:05.241 --> 01:24:09.612
So analyzing football plays is
a lot like coding in Python.

1844
01:24:09.712 --> 01:24:11.747
Yeah, yeah, I'm not following.

1845
01:24:11.847 --> 01:24:13.816
The patterns are finite.
So if you gather enough data,

1846
01:24:13.916 --> 01:24:15.451
you can get a sense
of which plays

1847
01:24:15.551 --> 01:24:17.353
are more or less
efficient against others.

1848
01:24:17.453 --> 01:24:19.088
And based on my predictive
analytics, I mean,

1849
01:24:19.188 --> 01:24:20.456
the defense--

1850
01:24:20.556 --> 01:24:24.560
Wait, wait, wait, don't tell us.
Go tell them.

1851
01:24:24.660 --> 01:24:26.095
Who?
The players on the field?

1852
01:24:26.195 --> 01:24:27.530
-Yeah.
-Do it.

1853
01:24:27.630 --> 01:24:28.431
Yeah.

1854
01:24:28.531 --> 01:24:29.665
Come on, guys, that's insane.

1855
01:24:29.765 --> 01:24:32.168
What am I gonna do?
Hop over the divider?

1856
01:24:32.268 --> 01:24:33.702
-Yeah.
- I would.

1857
01:24:33.802 --> 01:24:35.904
There's a security guard
right over there.

1858
01:24:37.373 --> 01:24:38.841
All right, we need
a distraction.

1859
01:24:38.941 --> 01:24:40.809
Just tell me the plan and
I'm ready to execute it.

1860
01:24:42.811 --> 01:24:46.382
* Ave

1861
01:24:46.482 --> 01:24:52.555
* Maria

1862
01:24:55.358 --> 01:25:01.330
* Gratia plena

1863
01:25:01.430 --> 01:25:06.101
-His voice!
-It's...beautiful.

1864
01:25:06.202 --> 01:25:07.870
Callie, Callie, look!

1865
01:25:07.970 --> 01:25:11.207
* Gratia plena

1866
01:25:11.307 --> 01:25:12.908
-It's actually working.
-Yeah.

1867
01:25:13.008 --> 01:25:18.714
* Maria, gratia plena

1868
01:25:18.814 --> 01:25:21.384
That's your cue.
Go, go, go.

1869
01:25:22.485 --> 01:25:24.086
Where is she going?

1870
01:25:24.187 --> 01:25:28.056
I've known him for 10 years and
I have never seen him do that.

1871
01:25:28.157 --> 01:25:32.361
* Dominus tecum

1872
01:25:32.461 --> 01:25:38.501
* Bendicta tu in mulieribus

1873
01:25:39.402 --> 01:25:45.241
* Et benedictus

1874
01:25:46.074 --> 01:25:52.047
* Et benedictus
fructus ventris *

1875
01:25:53.148 --> 01:25:55.518
* Ventris tui

1876
01:25:55.618 --> 01:25:57.286
Hey, trust me, Dad, I got
the play you need to run.

1877
01:25:57.386 --> 01:25:59.688
-Callie, what are you doing?
- I got this. Trust me.

1878
01:25:59.788 --> 01:26:02.391
Over the past two years, I've
developed an analytics algorithm

1879
01:26:02.491 --> 01:26:04.327
that can determine
the most likely outcome

1880
01:26:04.427 --> 01:26:05.761
of various strategies.

1881
01:26:05.861 --> 01:26:08.731
Long story short,
you do what I tell you,

1882
01:26:08.831 --> 01:26:10.299
you're going to the Super Bowl.

1883
01:26:10.399 --> 01:26:11.934
White board!

1884
01:26:13.001 --> 01:26:14.136
I would listen, Coach.

1885
01:26:14.237 --> 01:26:15.704
You're not really gonna
do that, though, right?

1886
01:26:17.473 --> 01:26:18.941
Let's hear her out.

1887
01:26:19.041 --> 01:26:20.843
Coach?
White board.

1888
01:26:21.877 --> 01:26:23.946
Here you go.

1889
01:26:24.046 --> 01:26:26.014
Huddle up.

1890
01:26:26.982 --> 01:26:28.651
* Can't stop this power,
this flaunt, this pose *

1891
01:26:28.751 --> 01:26:30.519
* This strut, this
look, this style *

1892
01:26:30.619 --> 01:26:32.421
* Come around me,
might get too hot *

1893
01:26:32.521 --> 01:26:34.690
* You go in, but I go out

1894
01:26:34.790 --> 01:26:36.892
* Boss, boss, boss,
boss, boss, boss, boss *

1895
01:26:38.627 --> 01:26:41.096
Dad. Save story time for later!

1896
01:26:41.196 --> 01:26:43.799
Yes, ma'am.

1897
01:26:43.899 --> 01:26:44.700
That's it.

1898
01:26:44.800 --> 01:26:46.269
You guys run it like I laid out,

1899
01:26:46.369 --> 01:26:49.104
my dad's got a 92% chance of
scoring the winning touchdown.

1900
01:26:49.204 --> 01:26:50.973
Okay.

1901
01:26:51.874 --> 01:26:56.845
Gentlemen...this might
cost me my job, but...

1902
01:26:56.945 --> 01:27:00.182
this is a smart play.
We're gonna go with it.

1903
01:27:00.283 --> 01:27:01.784
Game!

1904
01:27:01.884 --> 01:27:03.919
Win on three.
One, two, three--

1905
01:27:04.019 --> 01:27:05.588
Win!

1906
01:27:05.688 --> 01:27:09.258
-Hey, you must lock the middle.
-You got it, Coach.

1907
01:27:12.828 --> 01:27:14.830
This works, you're gonna
get the rushing record.

1908
01:27:14.930 --> 01:27:16.499
Yeah, but without Madden--

1909
01:27:16.599 --> 01:27:20.569
Dad, Dad, you don't need Madden.
You never did.

1910
01:27:22.104 --> 01:27:24.940
Strap in, folks!
Here we go!

1911
01:27:25.040 --> 01:27:26.575
Tony?

1912
01:27:26.675 --> 01:27:28.010
And Coleman and
Fisher are both on the field

1913
01:27:28.110 --> 01:27:31.013
at the same time in
an unconventional move

1914
01:27:31.113 --> 01:27:33.015
through the final play
to go to the Super Bowl.

1915
01:27:33.115 --> 01:27:35.518
There is no more
tense moment than this.

1916
01:27:35.618 --> 01:27:38.287
The entire season, the
trip to the Super Bowl

1917
01:27:38.387 --> 01:27:40.255
on the line right here.

1918
01:27:40.356 --> 01:27:42.124
With both of them on
the field at the same time,

1919
01:27:42.224 --> 01:27:44.660
I'm thinking for
something kind of tricky.

1920
01:27:44.760 --> 01:27:46.161
Oh, it is tricky.

1921
01:27:46.261 --> 01:27:47.696
It's a direct step to Coleman.

1922
01:27:47.796 --> 01:27:50.966
Around the right side,
he's looking for a gap.

1923
01:27:51.066 --> 01:27:53.736
Go, go, go!

1924
01:27:55.871 --> 01:27:57.606
Matthias has broken free.

1925
01:27:57.706 --> 01:27:59.508
He's coming up to
make the tackle.

1926
01:27:59.608 --> 01:28:01.143
But look at this!

1927
01:28:01.243 --> 01:28:04.347
Coleman's gonna go across
the field with a lateral.

1928
01:28:04.447 --> 01:28:06.281
He's got Fisher!

1929
01:28:06.382 --> 01:28:09.017
Wait!

1930
01:28:09.117 --> 01:28:10.285
On the feet!

1931
01:28:10.386 --> 01:28:13.288
And Anderson Fisher is in!

1932
01:28:13.389 --> 01:28:17.025
The Falcons have won it in
the most improbable of ways!

1933
01:28:17.125 --> 01:28:20.996
And Atlanta is heading
to the Super Bowl!

1934
01:28:21.096 --> 01:28:23.966
Bobby Coleman had a
chance at the rushing record

1935
01:28:24.066 --> 01:28:28.070
and chose to get his
team to the Super Bowl.

1936
01:28:28.170 --> 01:28:31.574
That gave me goosebumps
right there, Jim.

1937
01:28:39.482 --> 01:28:40.649
Coleman!

1938
01:28:41.984 --> 01:28:43.218
Aah!

1939
01:28:43.318 --> 01:28:46.789
You weren't kidding!
You're a great hugger.

1940
01:28:46.889 --> 01:28:48.924
-It's a heck of a play!
-Yeah.

1941
01:28:49.024 --> 01:28:50.192
You could've beat
my rushing record,

1942
01:28:50.292 --> 01:28:52.227
but you put the team first.

1943
01:28:52.327 --> 01:28:54.096
Look, don't tell nobody but, uh,

1944
01:28:54.196 --> 01:28:55.864
you might be my
favorite player again.

1945
01:28:59.067 --> 01:29:00.235
Oh, hey!

1946
01:29:00.335 --> 01:29:02.671
Anderson.

1947
01:29:02.771 --> 01:29:04.673
You was right about everything.

1948
01:29:06.475 --> 01:29:09.612
Or...were you?

1949
01:29:15.551 --> 01:29:17.920
Uh-uh.

1950
01:29:18.020 --> 01:29:19.688
Coleman!

1951
01:29:19.788 --> 01:29:21.424
Coleman, you can't
leave me like that!

1952
01:29:21.524 --> 01:29:24.693
It was the game.
It was the game!

1953
01:29:31.600 --> 01:29:32.735
Yes!

1954
01:29:32.835 --> 01:29:34.002
Okay, now,
that was pretty much

1955
01:29:34.102 --> 01:29:35.170
the coolest thing
I've ever seen.

1956
01:29:35.270 --> 01:29:36.739
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

1957
01:29:41.944 --> 01:29:43.779
Um, hey, in case
you were wondering,

1958
01:29:43.879 --> 01:29:46.715
now would be, like,
the perfect time to kiss me.

1959
01:29:51.654 --> 01:29:53.589
Yes! Yes, yes, I knew it!

1960
01:29:53.689 --> 01:29:59.394
Yeah...it was a weird
year, but also kind of the best.

1961
01:29:59.495 --> 01:30:04.266
We ended up getting second
place at the robotics nationals.

1962
01:30:04.366 --> 01:30:06.334
My dad signed a multiyear
deal with the Falcons

1963
01:30:06.435 --> 01:30:07.936
after winning the Super Bowl.

1964
01:30:08.036 --> 01:30:10.205
What's up, Coach?
Not you--other coach.

1965
01:30:10.305 --> 01:30:12.374
And I landed a
pretty sweet internship

1966
01:30:12.475 --> 01:30:14.142
doing analytics
for the Falcons.

1967
01:30:14.242 --> 01:30:15.944
My parents have
never been prouder.

1968
01:30:16.044 --> 01:30:17.813
That's right, Callie, you
talk about those numbers!

1969
01:30:17.913 --> 01:30:21.149
-This is it!
-Thank you!

1970
01:30:21.249 --> 01:30:22.651
Or louder .

1971
01:30:22.751 --> 01:30:24.086
Okay...

1972
01:30:24.186 --> 01:30:27.623
And this year
for my birthday...

1973
01:30:27.723 --> 01:30:30.959
all my wishes
actually came true.

1974
01:30:31.059 --> 01:30:34.663
For once, there were no
moving boxes in sight.

1975
01:30:34.763 --> 01:30:37.065
Just an actual group of
friends to call my own

1976
01:30:37.165 --> 01:30:40.536
in a city that's starting
to feel like home.

1977
01:30:40.636 --> 01:30:43.772
And I think maybe a boyfriend?

1978
01:30:43.872 --> 01:30:45.641
-Happy birthday, Callie.
-Thank you.

1979
01:30:45.741 --> 01:30:47.142
-Can I get one of those?
-Yes.

1980
01:30:47.242 --> 01:30:48.410
All right, Drake.

1981
01:30:48.511 --> 01:30:50.479
Why don't you move that arm
while you still got one?

1982
01:30:50.579 --> 01:30:52.214
-Dad...
-I'm sorry, Mr. Coleman.

1983
01:30:52.314 --> 01:30:54.382
-You know we--
-Oh, hey, hey, hey.

1984
01:30:54.483 --> 01:30:55.684
We got a big surprise outside.

1985
01:30:55.784 --> 01:30:57.686
Come on, let's go,
everybody outside now.

1986
01:30:57.786 --> 01:30:59.387
Come on!

1987
01:31:06.795 --> 01:31:10.866
* I can feel the
beat in my body *

1988
01:31:10.966 --> 01:31:15.170
* I can feel the rhythm
down to my toes, yeah *

1989
01:31:17.740 --> 01:31:20.242
-Surprise!

1990
01:31:20.342 --> 01:31:24.112
No way, no freakin' way!

1991
01:31:24.212 --> 01:31:26.949
-It's all yours.
-Oh my god!

1992
01:31:27.049 --> 01:31:28.951
-Okay, who wants a ride?
-Oh, I got the front!

1993
01:31:29.051 --> 01:31:31.820
Hey, hey! Have at it!

1994
01:31:31.920 --> 01:31:35.457
Oh, my goodness.

1995
01:31:49.004 --> 01:31:51.640
* We ain't going nowhere
but the top of the world *

1996
01:31:51.740 --> 01:31:54.376
* All right, don't
stop for fools *

1997
01:31:54.476 --> 01:31:58.380
Yep, I'd say Atlanta's
the perfect place for us.

1998
01:31:59.481 --> 01:32:01.249
* La, la, la-la, la

1999
01:32:01.349 --> 01:32:02.585
* La-la, la

2000
01:32:02.685 --> 01:32:06.822

* La, la, la, la-la-la

01:32:11.960 --> 01:32:13.095
* Top of the world

2004
01:32:13.962 --> 01:32:15.497
* Top of the world

2005
01:32:15.598 --> 01:32:17.499
* Whoo

2006
01:32:18.533 --> 01:32:22.805
* I can feel the weight
off my shoulders *

2007
01:32:22.905 --> 01:32:27.075
* I can feel myself
start to fly *

2008
01:32:27.175 --> 01:32:31.313
* The way I feel,
oh, I wanna show ya *

2009
01:32:31.413 --> 01:32:34.783
* The way I see
the world tonight *

2010
01:32:34.883 --> 01:32:38.621
* Making lemonade out
of all these lemons *

2011
01:32:39.688 --> 01:32:42.925
* Taking what we got
and we make it okay *

2012
01:32:43.992 --> 01:32:47.062
* If you ever fall, you
can reach out for me *

2013
01:32:47.996 --> 01:32:50.599
* 'Cause we are not gonna stop

2014
01:32:50.699 --> 01:32:53.468
* Straight to the top

2015
01:32:53.568 --> 01:32:55.738
* Top of the world, yeah

2016
01:32:55.838 --> 01:32:57.673
* We don't stop for fools

2017
01:32:57.773 --> 01:33:00.542
* Top of the world, all right

2018
01:33:00.643 --> 01:33:04.680
* We ain't goin' nowhere but the
top of the world, all right *

01:33:04.780 --> 01:33:06.481
* Don't stop for fools

01:33:06.581 --> 01:33:08.617
* Top of the world, yeah

2021
01:33:08.717 --> 01:33:10.552
* Top of the world

2022
01:33:10.653 --> 01:33:12.955
* La, la, la-la, la

* Oh, oh, oh

* Hey, hey

01:33:36.244 --> 01:33:38.513
* Let's go, let's go

2034
01:33:38.613 --> 01:33:39.715
* Oh, oh, oh

01:33:39.815 --> 01:33:41.784
* We got a new dance for you

2036
01:33:41.884 --> 01:33:44.086
* Only for the fly and sexy

2037
01:33:44.186 --> 01:33:46.789
* Wax on, wax off

2038
01:33:46.889 --> 01:33:48.256
* Let's get it, let's go

2039
01:33:48.356 --> 01:33:49.958
* Let's get it, let's go

2040
01:33:50.058 --> 01:33:52.527
* Oh, let's get it, let's go

2041
01:33:52.627 --> 01:33:54.062
* Let's get it, let's go

2042
01:33:54.162 --> 01:33:56.531
* Oh, let's get it, let's go

2043
01:33:56.631 --> 01:33:58.133
* Let's get it, let's go

2044
01:33:58.233 --> 01:34:00.502
* Oh, let's get it, let's go

2045
01:34:01.269 --> 01:34:02.570
* Wax on, wax off

2046
01:34:03.505 --> 01:34:04.673
* Wax on, wax off

2047
01:34:07.676 --> 01:34:09.978
* Wax on, wax off
