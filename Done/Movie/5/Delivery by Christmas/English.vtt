ICE-CREAM

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.520
DELIVERY BY CHRISTMAS

3
00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:29.120
What's up, Maksiu? Everything's okay?

4
00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:30.480
I wanna pee.

5
00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.080
Urgently? Okay, let's go.

6
00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:51.240
Merry Christmas!

7
00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:02.680
Merry Christmas!

8
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.520
GRANDPA

9
00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:29.000
- Hello, Krzysiu.
- I was at your place, Grandpa.

10
00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.800
<i>Congratulations. What did you want?</i>

11
00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.360
You know. Grandma promised me that ring.

12
00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.280
<i>In that case, talk to her.</i>

13
00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.360
I would, if she were alive.

14
00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.440
- Krzysztof, the investors.
- One moment, okay?

15
00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:47.520
Hello?

16
00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:50.600
He...

17
00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:10.760
<i>Wetness all around. Reach out. Be happy.</i>

18
00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.640
Can you manage by yourself?

19
00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.560
Just wait for me here, okay?

20
00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:36.720
OUT OF ORDER CLOSEST WC - 13TH FLOOR

21
00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:01.880
And you're here for what purpose?

22
00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:11.920
Then fire away.

23
00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:27.760
- Hi.
- I'm here.

24
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.200
- Yes. Uh, this is everything.
- I see.

25
00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:35.800
Just the code.

26
00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:38.600
- Maks?
- No.

27
00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:41.760
- Maksiu?
- No.

28
00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:44.480
- Looking for me?
- No, no!

29
00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:47.840
Thank you! Uh, Merry Christmas!

30
00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:58.600
I'll drop by, and this time
don't pretend you're not there.

31
00:04:58.680 --> 00:04:59.880
I heard scuffling.

32
00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:02.200
<i>Stop calling me, you're blocking the line.</i>

33
00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:04.520
<i>If I were dying, I wouldn't be
able to call an ambulance.</i>

34
00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:09.640
If you start dying, Grandpa,
just leave the ring in a visible place.

35
00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:12.040
<i>Okay, come over, maybe I'll leave it.</i>

36
00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:17.120
Weren't you supposed to wait for your mom?

37
00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:30.360
Maks!

38
00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:36.160
Maksiu?

39
00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:41.760
You should mind your kid,
not leave him alone to deal with a urinal.

40
00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:47.960
Um, well, thank you
for taking care of Maks. Let's go.

41
00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:50.760
He said the "F" word. Can I say it?

42
00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:52.600
No, no, no. Better not.

43
00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:55.360
Merry Christmas, yeah?

44
00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:57.680
Come on. Let's go.

45
00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:01.280
Oh no.

46
00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:05.520
- Um... what's wrong?
- Your son shredded my papers.

47
00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:08.560
I won't leave here until night.

48
00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:12.960
You know...

49
00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:14.480
I'm really sorry.

50
00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:18.520
Do you pick up things professionally?

51
00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:31.160
- Yes?
- Hello. I have a pick-up. For Krzysztof.

52
00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:35.320
A guy... in a suit.

53
00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:38.360
Said you've got something for him.

54
00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:41.320
Give him my holiday regards.

55
00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:43.200
He said it was something really important.

56
00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:46.880
If it's important, then why...
didn't he come himself?

57
00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:49.720
Some trouble at work. I don't know.
I really don't want to interfere,

58
00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:53.440
but he said it's a matter...
of life and death.

59
00:06:57.720 --> 00:06:59.080
Excuse me.

60
00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:01.800
I do actually have something for him.

61
00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:05.040
Come in!

62
00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:09.520
Oh, that's Wilhelm.
A member of the family.

63
00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:14.440
He spent more time with my wife
than I did, so I immortalized him.

64
00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:19.360
Mom, a frigate! A clipper!
The fastest sailing ships!

65
00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:22.520
Yeah, I sailed
around the whole world on that one.

66
00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:26.160
- Can you help me wrap the gift up?
- Sure.

67
00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:35.760
And... this is for Krzysztof, right?

68
00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:39.320
Yeah. He likes this kind of stuff.

69
00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:43.720
- When will he get it?
- Delivery by Christmas.

70
00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:45.400
Company policy.

71
00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:47.680
Maks!

72
00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:50.960
Thank you. Goodbye!

73
00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:53.440
<i>Ahoy!</i>

74
00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:09.360
- What's that?
- Oh, a trifle. I'll deliver it on the way.

75
00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:15.560
<i>Sweet of the Chimney</i>. Thanks.

76
00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:20.120
Kama... Maks' gift was supposed to arrive.

77
00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:22.416
The guys were to redirect
the package, but it's not here.

78
00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:25.120
Not everyone's back yet. It'll be here.

79
00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:26.200
Hiya!

80
00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:28.960
Hiya, kid!

81
00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.760
- One, two, three... One...
- The speech.

82
00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:46.760
Uh, welcome, all employees.

83
00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:49.640
So, yes. Christmas Eve is, uh...

84
00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:53.680
This is, um, could be
the time to sum things up.

85
00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:57.040
I've been with you for a few weeks now.

86
00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:01.280
Thank you very much...
for bestowing your trust upon me.

87
00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:09.040
An... and trust, as we
know, is a key... core...

88
00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:18.200
I work on my core every day.

89
00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:23.800
As statistics show...

90
00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:27.160
Christmas Eve is the time of miracles!

91
00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:30.880
And that's why
I wanted to wish you all the best.

92
00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:36.440
I would also like to say, uh... that...

93
00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:55.600
<i>Now, imagine a lion.</i>

94
00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:59.160
- <i>Yes, you are the lion.</i>
- Yes, I am.

95
00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:02.080
<i>You're a charismatic predator,</i>

96
00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:05.840
<i>a determined mammal
who always gets what he wants.</i>

97
00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:14.240
Nobody knows how to use
that PA system, so don't worry.

98
00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:18.400
Come to the party.

99
00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:22.680
The director has no time to party.

100
00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:25.360
He leads the pride.

101
00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:30.840
The pride is, uh... is there right now.

102
00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:34.040
The team doesn't like me.

103
00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:36.320
Beginnings are always hard.

104
00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:41.880
And... you don't have to
be a lion the whole time.

105
00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:46.880
Besides... uh, I'm sure
there's someone who likes you.

106
00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:49.480
Back there... or somewhere else.

107
00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:53.440
Are you crazy?

108
00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:58.440
W-What, what was that?

109
00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:01.320
Well, you came to me.

110
00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:05.000
Because... I felt sorry for you.

111
00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:20.000
<i>...who always gets what he wants.</i>

112
00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:23.840
<i>Sometimes, a lion
may be blinded by his success.</i>

113
00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:25.280
<i>But not you.</i>

114
00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:28.840
<i>Because you have the heart of a lion.</i>

115
00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:03.400
We'll see... who's sorry tomorrow.

116
00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:11.960
- Hi, butterfly.
- Beautiful night.

117
00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:13.640
You're so hot too?

118
00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:18.840
Can I drop off Maks at you tomorrow?

119
00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:20.560
For two or three hours.

120
00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:23.520
Grażka?

121
00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:25.480
Wet hair?

122
00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:27.320
Without panties in the frost?

123
00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:29.200
Cover up.

124
00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:30.640
Help me.

125
00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:33.440
Marysiu, you're ok?

126
00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:36.320
Very good. Better than ever.

127
00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:38.360
Finish this cigarette and come inside.

128
00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:40.320
- Grażka.
- Bye.

129
00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:41.440
Good night.

130
00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:53.120
24TH DECEMBER

131
00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.240
Uh, hello. I've got a package for Mirek.

132
00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:32.680
That's my son. I can take it.

133
00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:35.240
Merry Christmas! All the best.

134
00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.480
Hello. Delivery.

135
00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:05.280
A package for me?

136
00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:07.400
- Yes. Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

137
00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:18.680
- Hello.
- Oh, hello. Wonderful.

138
00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:21.056
Thank you so much.
Were there any problems?

139
00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:22.200
None.

140
00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:25.200
- Oh, hello.
- Hello.

141
00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:28.560
Um, in that case, uh...

142
00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:31.960
- No. There's no need. Merry Christmas!
- No, really, 'cause... Please wait...

143
00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:36.960
Oh, I don't have anything after all.

144
00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:40.440
No worries. Goodbye.

145
00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:52.040
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Grandpa, what did you send me?

146
00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:55.800
<i>You didn't get the ring?
Wait, my cabbage stew is burning.</i>

147
00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:28.840
Auntie Gienia poured the flour.

148
00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:31.056
Maybe you could
start decorating the Christmas tree, eh?

149
00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:34.360
'Cause Graża said
that the dough was sticky

150
00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:36.080
and it's gonna stick.

151
00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:38.960
And the worst thing that can happen

152
00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:41.416
is when you stick to something you
shouldn't. And you're stuck.

153
00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:43.240
Maks, wash off that dough, okay?

154
00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:52.640
Mom, the gift!

155
00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:54.880
Your gift!

156
00:16:56.760 --> 00:17:00.200
- Have you written a letter to Santa?
- I haven't.

157
00:17:04.600 --> 00:17:07.040
I'll write it for you.
What would you like to get?

158
00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:11.960
I've already got everything.
I've got you. And a job.

159
00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:14.640
Mom, you should want something.

160
00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:18.240
I want...

161
00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:25.920
Oh! The Christmas Eve map.

162
00:17:26.839 --> 00:17:29.200
No, come on. What comes first?

163
00:17:31.119 --> 00:17:32.720
- Well?
- Decorating the tree?

164
00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:33.840
Exactly.

165
00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:39.560
Zbyszek. Move over.

166
00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:41.600
Zbyszek, Zbyszek...

167
00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:45.440
Mom!

168
00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:55.560
- Hello?
- <i>Maks, is that you?</i>

169
00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:58.080
<i>We peed together yesterday, remember?</i>

170
00:17:58.680 --> 00:18:00.600
<i>Can you put your Mom on the phone?</i>

171
00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:03.080
She's busy now.

172
00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:06.920
<i>Listen... And where's your Mom?</i>

173
00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:10.640
- Here.
<i>- Which means where?</i>

174
00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:31.240
Merry Christmas to you.

175
00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:34.320
- You're here for me?
- Yes.

176
00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:37.240
It's the wrong package.
Whatever's in here isn't for me.

177
00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:41.000
We don't always get what we want.

178
00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:43.240
You don't understand how serious this is.

179
00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:47.520
Oh... Excuse me,
how did you even find me, huh?

180
00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:51.600
You have a very intelligent child.
I'm sorry, could you put on your uniform?

181
00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:53.520
There's work to do.

182
00:18:54.120 --> 00:18:57.680
You do know it's Christmas Eve?
It's my day off.

183
00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:04.320
And... you won't do anything about this?

184
00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:05.920
It's Christmas!

185
00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:19.240
Hi, Kama!

186
00:19:19.280 --> 00:19:21.240
<i>Hi, darling.</i>

187
00:19:21.320 --> 00:19:23.520
<i>- This is a total mess.</i>
- Okay?

188
00:19:24.280 --> 00:19:30.040
<i>Some client got the wrong package.
Your deliveries from today are screwed up.</i>

189
00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:31.360
But what do you mean?

190
00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:36.720
<i>The packages went to the wrong places.
I don't know, something wrong with labels.</i>

191
00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:39.280
<i>Yours too, with the present for...</i>

192
00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:41.256
Kama, Kama,
you're on a speaker right now, you know?

193
00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:43.920
<i>Your most important package.</i>

194
00:19:55.480 --> 00:19:56.800
Oh, fuck!

195
00:19:56.880 --> 00:19:59.320
- Mom, come on!
- How did this happen?

196
00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:01.800
<i>Christmas is a time of miracles.</i>

197
00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:03.840
So, where could Maks' present be?

198
00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:06.280
<i>At one of these addresses?</i>

199
00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:10.240
<i>Good thing you only had four deliveries.</i>

200
00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:13.400
<i>But take it easy, do it after Christmas.</i>

201
00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:15.520
I'll deal with it. Take care.

202
00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:17.600
<i>Marysia? What are you up to?</i>

203
00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:20.800
Next item on the list.

204
00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:23.600
Maksiu...

205
00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:25.120
CHRISTMAS EVE MAP MAKING GINGERBREAD

206
00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:46.080
- Finally.
- Excuse me?

207
00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:48.800
- Excuses accepted. We can go.
- "We"?

208
00:20:50.760 --> 00:20:53.280
Please deliver this to the right person
and retrieve my package.

209
00:20:56.720 --> 00:20:57.920
Why have you crossed me out?

210
00:20:58.000 --> 00:20:59.640
This is your address. This is my address.

211
00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:01.976
I've already got those two packages.
I've got three addresses left.

212
00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:04.720
But I need my package as soon as possible.

213
00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:06.280
I figured.

214
00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:11.320
Someone tampered with it.

215
00:21:14.760 --> 00:21:15.880
Okay.

216
00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:20.320
I can manage on my own.

217
00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:22.200
I doubt that.

218
00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:25.160
- Please leave.
- You can go, friend.

219
00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:27.720
So, we're friends now?

220
00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:30.400
Krzysztof.

221
00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:43.640
Shouldn't a courier's route
be closer to home?

222
00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:45.520
This isn't my route. I'm substituting.

223
00:21:54.680 --> 00:21:55.760
Gas.

224
00:21:57.720 --> 00:22:01.040
- Diesel.
- But it's running out, yeah?

225
00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:04.440
That? That's the indicator. It's broken.

226
00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:08.320
So, how do you know...
how much fuel is left?

227
00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:13.680
Uh, today is Friday...
I got a refill on Wednesday...

228
00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:16.040
No, uh, no. On Monday.

229
00:22:16.120 --> 00:22:20.200
- I think, we shouldn't run out.
- We shouldn't run out?

230
00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:21.800
How can you be sure?

231
00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:25.880
It's like soft-boiling eggs, yeah?
You just know when to take them out.

232
00:22:25.960 --> 00:22:27.360
No.

233
00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:30.560
That's not how you soft-boil eggs.

234
00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:32.760
Fine. I trust my intuition, okay?

235
00:22:32.840 --> 00:22:34.000
Your intuition.

236
00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:36.920
'Cause of your intuition,
we'll be... stuck in a field

237
00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:40.120
or I'll have to run
with a bucket to get some gas.

238
00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:43.440
- Diesel.
- Country dogs will bark at us.

239
00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:46.680
- So? Are you afraid of dogs?
- That's not the point!

240
00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:49.400
One must have a plan.

241
00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:52.560
One must be prepared,
think things through.

242
00:22:52.640 --> 00:22:56.520
I've got a plan.
I'm prepared for anything.

243
00:22:57.960 --> 00:22:59.600
I can see that.

244
00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:05.960
Did you turn on
some kind of seat heating or what?

245
00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:08.320
Oh, uh, you're sitting on my dryer.

246
00:23:12.560 --> 00:23:14.120
This is your plan?

247
00:23:14.840 --> 00:23:18.600
Y... you've got a
bathroom in... in your car.

248
00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:23.440
That's how I spice up my life, y'know?
So I don't become a bore.

249
00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:27.840
I got the hint.

250
00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:31.640
Where are we going?

251
00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:35.720
A FEW HOURS EARLIER

252
00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:53.840
Michał! Could you get that?

253
00:23:57.360 --> 00:24:01.600
- Uh, hello. I've got a package for Mirek.
- That's my son. I can take it.

254
00:24:02.680 --> 00:24:05.160
Merry Christmas! All the best.

255
00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:09.840
From some Milena. Maybe it's a gift?

256
00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:13.600
Definitely a gift.

257
00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:23.440
I'll open it and put it under the tree!

258
00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:35.400
He's a grown boy...

259
00:24:36.760 --> 00:24:39.160
and you're inspecting his stuff?

260
00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:40.920
Honey?

261
00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:43.160
Am I seeing things?

262
00:24:54.840 --> 00:24:57.480
No, your eyes are fine, Mario la.

263
00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:03.720
There you go. A gas station.

264
00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:08.280
But you'd rather risk it, huh?

265
00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:11.520
I'll do it for you. Here you go.

266
00:25:12.560 --> 00:25:17.200
GAS STATION

267
00:25:21.120 --> 00:25:22.320
Fill it up.

268
00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:27.640
- Fill what up?
- You wanted to fuel up, so go ahead.

269
00:25:53.800 --> 00:25:55.840
- Merry Christmas!
- Yeah, yeah.

270
00:25:55.920 --> 00:25:57.520
I can help.

271
00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:02.280
No, hold it. I'll pull.

272
00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:12.200
- The hose is too short.
- We can manage.

273
00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:19.320
If you could pass it under the car,

274
00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:22.720
- I'll grab it on the other side.
- Under where?

275
00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:27.960
It's Christmas.
It pays to be nice to people.

276
00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:32.160
Can you move the car?

277
00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:34.840
Move the car.

278
00:26:34.920 --> 00:26:36.480
- What a nuisance.
- What?

279
00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:38.840
Who's a nuisance?

280
00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:41.840
She can't park properly
and I'm supposed to...

281
00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:43.960
drag the hose under the car?

282
00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:48.280
Here. You fill it up.

283
00:26:48.360 --> 00:26:49.920
Do it yourself.

284
00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:19.280
- Hello.
- Hello.

285
00:27:19.880 --> 00:27:21.720
Our uncle got a hold of this reindeer

286
00:27:21.800 --> 00:27:25.000
and it's for my nephew, Jaś. He's four.

287
00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:27.360
How do we erase this?

288
00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:31.920
<i>Auntie Krysia is an old cow!
Kiss my hairy ass!</i>

289
00:27:32.840 --> 00:27:35.760
All right.
Uh, no point in struggling with this.

290
00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:43.440
- This one should be fine.
- Thank you.

291
00:27:43.520 --> 00:27:45.240
- You're welcome. Merry Christmas!
- Thanks.

292
00:27:45.280 --> 00:27:46.760
- Come again.
- Thanks.

293
00:27:46.840 --> 00:27:48.360
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

294
00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:50.160
Hi, Dad.

295
00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:52.240
What are you doing here?

296
00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:54.840
We've been calling you,
but you're not picking up.

297
00:27:54.920 --> 00:27:56.360
Well, I'm at work.

298
00:27:57.240 --> 00:27:59.240
Has anything happened or...?

299
00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:01.720
No.

300
00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:06.000
Who's Milena?

301
00:28:07.560 --> 00:28:09.640
A friend from work. Why?

302
00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:13.200
Well... You got a package...

303
00:28:13.960 --> 00:28:15.600
From that...

304
00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:17.680
that girl,

305
00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:19.720
Milena.

306
00:28:20.320 --> 00:28:21.640
HI DADDY!

307
00:28:23.800 --> 00:28:26.600
- Dad, this is some kind of joke.
- M-m-mirek...

308
00:28:26.680 --> 00:28:29.080
This looks like a serious matter to me.

309
00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:31.200
But Dad, this is impossible.

310
00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:41.640
Take it. Take one, 'cause
your sugar level will be dropping now.

311
00:28:41.720 --> 00:28:44.800
- Take it.
- I, I, I'll ask.

312
00:28:46.240 --> 00:28:49.640
- Wa... wait here, I'll ask.
- But Mirek, there's nothing to ask about!

313
00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:53.120
Oh, it's you.

314
00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:56.640
- You're smoking?
- Yeah.

315
00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:01.440
Why are you so spooked?

316
00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:07.960
- I got...
- Fucking Christmas!

317
00:29:08.040 --> 00:29:11.720
I tried moving a unicorn
on a shelf and some kid bit me.

318
00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:15.000
I got that surprise gift from you.

319
00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:16.280
- Ohhhhhh...
- Can I have one?

320
00:29:16.360 --> 00:29:18.480
And? Did you like it?

321
00:29:19.640 --> 00:29:21.680
I was kind of at a loss for words.

322
00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:24.920
Was it that Halloween party?

323
00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:26.720
What if the kid was rabid?

324
00:29:27.320 --> 00:29:31.000
I'm off in a moment, but maybe...
you wanna talk about it?

325
00:29:35.560 --> 00:29:37.360
Drop by my house.

326
00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:39.280
It's kind of necessary now.

327
00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:40.880
Fuck, I hate kids.

328
00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:43.200
You'll heal in no time!

329
00:29:45.680 --> 00:29:47.520
THE COUNTER SHOULD SHOW ZERO

330
00:29:54.680 --> 00:29:58.560
- All right, I'll go pay. How much?
- You wanted to fill it up...

331
00:30:01.280 --> 00:30:03.040
Sixty liters.

332
00:30:03.640 --> 00:30:06.240
Diesel.
You were supposed to fill it with diesel.

333
00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:31.680
- Merry Christmas! To you, miss.
- Goodbye.

334
00:30:42.320 --> 00:30:44.160
Not much of a reserve.

335
00:31:16.840 --> 00:31:18.840
You'll have to start cleaning on your own.

336
00:31:22.280 --> 00:31:24.240
Your pants are crumpled.

337
00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:38.320
The Grandparents are waiting.

338
00:31:42.560 --> 00:31:46.640
What a beautiful tree.
Did you decorate it yourself, Mirek?

339
00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:50.640
With Mom, like every year, Grandma.

340
00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:55.480
So, my darlings?
I think it's time... to exchange wishes.

341
00:31:59.320 --> 00:32:02.000
When will she be here?

342
00:32:02.920 --> 00:32:04.280
Who?

343
00:32:05.640 --> 00:32:07.080
Mirek's lady friend.

344
00:32:07.160 --> 00:32:09.440
What friend?

345
00:32:09.520 --> 00:32:12.800
From work, Grandma. She got the address,
but I don't know if she comes.

346
00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:17.000
Then tell us about her. Come on!

347
00:32:17.080 --> 00:32:21.000
Well, we... don't know
each other very well.

348
00:32:21.080 --> 00:32:24.240
- We've... only spoken a few times.
- Yes?

349
00:32:24.320 --> 00:32:26.360
I don't really know
how this even happened.

350
00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:29.360
You've got a kid
and you don't know how it happened?

351
00:32:30.320 --> 00:32:32.080
He made a baby?!

352
00:32:32.160 --> 00:32:34.080
Mirek has a baby?

353
00:32:34.920 --> 00:32:36.800
- What will it be?
- No, uh...

354
00:32:36.880 --> 00:32:39.360
I mean, I don't remember everything.

355
00:32:41.760 --> 00:32:43.640
Maybe I can still get out of this somehow.

356
00:32:44.400 --> 00:32:45.600
Excuse me?

357
00:32:46.240 --> 00:32:47.640
What do you mean "get out of this"?

358
00:33:08.040 --> 00:33:09.720
Excuse me.

359
00:33:39.720 --> 00:33:42.600
Well... Mirek, go.

360
00:33:42.680 --> 00:33:44.400
But what am I to tell her?

361
00:33:44.480 --> 00:33:46.640
Tell her...

362
00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:48.000
Well?

363
00:33:49.360 --> 00:33:51.160
What do you usually say?

364
00:33:51.240 --> 00:33:52.640
You just babbled like a loon.

365
00:33:52.720 --> 00:33:53.840
Jesus Christ...

366
00:33:55.600 --> 00:33:56.600
But from the heart.

367
00:33:58.360 --> 00:34:00.640
Tell her... it will be all right.

368
00:34:01.640 --> 00:34:05.480
That you'll always be at her side
and that you'll think of everything.

369
00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:09.640
After all, you work in a toy store,
so you'll bring the kid...

370
00:34:10.680 --> 00:34:12.920
- stuffed toys.
- Yeah.

371
00:34:14.040 --> 00:34:16.159
And since you
still live with us, we'll help out too.

372
00:34:25.840 --> 00:34:29.120
Hello, sir. I'm very sorry, but
I delivered a package here this morning.

373
00:34:29.199 --> 00:34:31.960
But there was
a problem at the sorting office

374
00:34:32.040 --> 00:34:35.040
and there was a mistake.
This is your package.

375
00:34:36.719 --> 00:34:39.320
You do have that package
from this morning, right?

376
00:34:41.480 --> 00:34:45.000
- That one wasn't for me?
- No, no. I apologize.

377
00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:48.480
Just a second, okay?

378
00:34:55.560 --> 00:34:57.080
Yes...

379
00:34:58.120 --> 00:34:59.840
Oh, great. Thank you very much.

380
00:34:59.920 --> 00:35:03.600
- No, thank you. Uh...
- All the best. Goodbye.

381
00:35:04.120 --> 00:35:05.640
Merry Christmas.

382
00:35:06.520 --> 00:35:07.760
Goodbye.

383
00:35:35.720 --> 00:35:37.320
There is no baby.

384
00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:41.200
So, where is it?

385
00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:44.200
The courier made a mistake.
You were worried for nothing.

386
00:35:47.480 --> 00:35:49.320
There won't be a baby?

387
00:35:49.920 --> 00:35:51.040
Can you pass the herring?

388
00:35:56.560 --> 00:35:58.240
But... this isn't it.

389
00:36:00.320 --> 00:36:01.400
Seat belt.

390
00:36:05.160 --> 00:36:08.080
A FEW HOURS EARLIER

391
00:36:18.520 --> 00:36:20.880
Hello. Delivery.

392
00:36:21.480 --> 00:36:23.000
A package for me?

393
00:36:23.080 --> 00:36:24.920
- Goodbye!
- Goodbye.

394
00:36:27.680 --> 00:36:28.920
From Estera?

395
00:36:32.560 --> 00:36:35.320
<i>The giraffe loves the juicy pulp</i>

396
00:36:35.400 --> 00:36:38.960
<i>of acacia and commiphora leaves.</i>

397
00:36:41.640 --> 00:36:43.920
<i>While looking for a source of food</i>

398
00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:46.160
<i>the giraffe may cross many kilometers.</i>

399
00:36:49.880 --> 00:36:53.320
<i>It often follows
the smell of distant rain.</i>

400
00:36:55.960 --> 00:36:59.600
<i>Trees are its salvation,
even if the female has to</i>

401
00:36:59.680 --> 00:37:03.280
<i>extend its neck to reach the leaves.</i>

402
00:37:03.360 --> 00:37:05.920
I knew the most beautiful
giraffes were in Botswana.

403
00:37:17.280 --> 00:37:20.040
<i>One would think that
when a giraffe raises its head</i>

404
00:37:20.120 --> 00:37:22.160
<i>the blood quickly drains from the brain</i>

405
00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:24.960
<i>causing a loss of consciousness.</i>

406
00:37:27.600 --> 00:37:29.200
<i>However, it is not so.</i>

407
00:37:30.800 --> 00:37:32.960
Estera, honey, you'll get cold.

408
00:37:33.040 --> 00:37:34.520
Cover yourself.

409
00:37:34.600 --> 00:37:40.240
<i>Specialized blood vessel shunts prevent
the blood from rapid draining.</i>

410
00:37:47.880 --> 00:37:53.040
<i>They owe their survival
to a life strategy developed over</i>

411
00:37:53.120 --> 00:37:55.040
<i>millions of years.</i>

412
00:37:55.760 --> 00:37:57.000
How graceful.

413
00:39:12.440 --> 00:39:15.360
Listen, you're not...
the only one whose package is missing.

414
00:39:17.400 --> 00:39:20.080
Mine is too. A gift for Maks.

415
00:39:20.840 --> 00:39:24.240
A hand-painted sailing ship model.
Very hard to get.

416
00:39:24.320 --> 00:39:26.160
I'm sorry for the kid.

417
00:39:26.240 --> 00:39:28.400
Yeah, it cost me half my pay.

418
00:39:33.160 --> 00:39:36.240
A kid should be loved,
not bought with expensive gifts.

419
00:39:39.720 --> 00:39:42.880
Thanks, you've broadened my horizons.

420
00:39:43.920 --> 00:39:47.400
- You're compensating for something.
- What do you care?

421
00:39:47.480 --> 00:39:49.536
You don't have to say if you
don't want to. I already know.

422
00:39:49.560 --> 00:39:50.600
Know what?

423
00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:56.560
Well, I know... girls like you.

424
00:39:56.640 --> 00:39:58.520
Independent.

425
00:40:00.360 --> 00:40:02.680
Lonely, with emotional baggage.

426
00:40:03.560 --> 00:40:05.640
Yeah? You got any other advice for me?

427
00:40:07.280 --> 00:40:08.960
You should try harder?

428
00:40:20.640 --> 00:40:23.720
- I lost my tailpipe.
- What?

429
00:40:23.800 --> 00:40:27.400
My exhaust pipe is wobbling.
Can you check it?

430
00:40:28.360 --> 00:40:30.080
- Me?
- In the back.

431
00:40:35.520 --> 00:40:37.320
God, what a clunker.

432
00:40:52.160 --> 00:40:53.440
Moron.

433
00:41:27.520 --> 00:41:28.840
New dress?

434
00:41:31.080 --> 00:41:32.080
Do you like it?

435
00:41:33.840 --> 00:41:35.160
It's alright.

436
00:41:35.240 --> 00:41:36.680
That's all?

437
00:41:38.160 --> 00:41:41.280
The tailor said that... it was perfect.

438
00:41:41.960 --> 00:41:45.040
- But I'm not sure.
- You said he's a good tailor.

439
00:41:46.040 --> 00:41:48.840
You even wanted to buy him
a gift or something.

440
00:41:48.920 --> 00:41:50.000
I have.

441
00:41:50.080 --> 00:41:53.400
He makes such beautiful things for others,
but he himself is kind of...

442
00:41:54.440 --> 00:41:55.560
transparent.

443
00:42:00.160 --> 00:42:01.200
Need help?

444
00:42:07.800 --> 00:42:09.160
Your hair.

445
00:42:51.400 --> 00:42:53.760
Thank you.

446
00:42:54.960 --> 00:42:58.040
Are we leaving already? It's still early.

447
00:43:00.160 --> 00:43:02.000
A seam ripped.

448
00:43:02.080 --> 00:43:04.040
Maybe the tailor's still open.

449
00:44:12.240 --> 00:44:13.560
Is it still wobbling?

450
00:44:15.080 --> 00:44:16.680
You abandoned me here.

451
00:44:20.200 --> 00:44:22.080
I spaced out. Are you getting in?

452
00:44:36.680 --> 00:44:39.040
Your phone beeped or something.

453
00:44:45.400 --> 00:44:47.920
Just don't get muck on the upholstery.

454
00:44:54.120 --> 00:44:56.600
Okay. Maybe let's go, 'cause...

455
00:44:57.320 --> 00:45:00.000
- It's 4 p.m.
- Maks. Uh, Maks comes first.

456
00:45:00.080 --> 00:45:03.400
- What?
- I have to pick him up from the aunties.

457
00:45:05.280 --> 00:45:06.800
From w-where?

458
00:45:07.400 --> 00:45:08.976
Our neighbors are taking care of my son.

459
00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:11.480
They're going out for Christmas Eve.
What don't you understand?

460
00:45:11.600 --> 00:45:12.640
Okay.

461
00:45:30.640 --> 00:45:32.000
Mrs. Estera.

462
00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:36.800
I got your gift.

463
00:45:39.680 --> 00:45:41.080
It was surprising.

464
00:45:43.280 --> 00:45:47.800
We've known each other for so many years,
so... maybe it's high time we...

465
00:45:50.520 --> 00:45:53.360
stopped being so official.

466
00:45:55.280 --> 00:45:56.680
Right.

467
00:45:58.760 --> 00:46:00.280
A seam gave out.

468
00:46:58.080 --> 00:46:59.480
I understood the message.

469
00:47:01.320 --> 00:47:03.880
You're a beautiful woman, Estera and...

470
00:47:04.680 --> 00:47:06.880
if you're ready...

471
00:47:10.200 --> 00:47:11.440
then so am I.

472
00:47:17.840 --> 00:47:20.400
I'm just here about the ripped seam.

473
00:48:41.080 --> 00:48:43.080
- Give me a minute.
- Okay.

474
00:48:50.160 --> 00:48:52.680
- Honey...
- <i>Krzysiek, you were supposed to be home.</i>

475
00:48:53.240 --> 00:48:54.240
- Well...
<i>- Well?</i>

476
00:48:54.320 --> 00:48:57.040
I, I, I know, Zuza, but let's not
do this over the phone, okay?

477
00:48:57.120 --> 00:48:58.640
<i>Where exactly are you?</i>

478
00:48:58.720 --> 00:49:01.480
- Yeah. Where am I?
<i>- Where?</i>

479
00:49:02.160 --> 00:49:03.160
- I'm lost.
<i>- Lost.</i>

480
00:49:03.240 --> 00:49:06.000
I mean with my work.

481
00:49:06.080 --> 00:49:07.000
<i>- Everything's ready. You promised me.</i>
- Yeah.

482
00:49:07.080 --> 00:49:09.376
<i>The parents are already here.
You know this is important to me.</i>

483
00:49:09.400 --> 00:49:11.040
<i>When will you be back?</i>

484
00:49:11.120 --> 00:49:13.400
In-in-in half an hour.

485
00:49:13.480 --> 00:49:16.560
Thank you very much. Have fun.

486
00:49:18.440 --> 00:49:21.520
A visit with the family.
Been waiting for this all year.

487
00:49:21.600 --> 00:49:23.560
The cheesecake won't eat itself.

488
00:49:23.640 --> 00:49:25.600
Come on. Bye.

489
00:49:37.960 --> 00:49:39.320
Mom...

490
00:49:39.400 --> 00:49:41.520
- Yes, honey?
- I need to poop.

491
00:49:56.760 --> 00:49:59.320
Fuck it.

492
00:50:41.760 --> 00:50:43.120
Okay.

493
00:50:54.280 --> 00:50:56.720
It's an important day.
And my first time on patrol.

494
00:50:57.480 --> 00:50:58.640
Yeah.

495
00:50:58.720 --> 00:51:02.360
The city's empty, there's no one in the
shops and thieves are having a field day.

496
00:51:06.960 --> 00:51:08.440
But there are no shops here.

497
00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:11.440
There's nothing here.

498
00:51:11.520 --> 00:51:13.840
POLICE

499
00:51:15.360 --> 00:51:18.160
Should I wipe the windshield? I will, eh?

500
00:51:18.760 --> 00:51:20.280
Its' a cool task.

501
00:51:41.720 --> 00:51:43.800
We used to have squad cars...

502
00:51:44.640 --> 00:51:46.280
that didn't even have ventilation.

503
00:51:50.120 --> 00:51:54.320
Models from '95, '96... '98...

504
00:51:54.400 --> 00:51:56.400
That's the year I was born.

505
00:52:07.040 --> 00:52:10.120
Hard to stay focused
on a day like this, huh?

506
00:52:19.760 --> 00:52:21.040
Look!

507
00:53:02.960 --> 00:53:06.160
Officer Bogdan Kolenda, road check.

508
00:53:06.240 --> 00:53:08.280
- Papers, please.
- Sure.

509
00:53:22.520 --> 00:53:25.720
Excuse me, could we get this done
rather quickly? I can pay the ticket.

510
00:53:26.680 --> 00:53:29.120
- Who is the vehicle's owner?
- I am.

511
00:53:29.200 --> 00:53:32.560
- Maria Kwiecień?
- No. I mean yes!

512
00:53:32.640 --> 00:53:36.240
Jan Maria Kwiecień. That's my name.

513
00:53:36.880 --> 00:53:40.120
But it was too long to fit
in the registration papers.

514
00:53:41.600 --> 00:53:42.920
Okay, so...

515
00:53:43.760 --> 00:53:44.840
How much?

516
00:53:47.040 --> 00:53:51.600
- He's trying to make an illegal payment...
- N-no, n-n-not illegal...

517
00:53:51.680 --> 00:53:54.920
Sir, this vehicle's
technical inspection is overdue.

518
00:53:59.160 --> 00:54:02.200
Of course it is.

519
00:54:03.240 --> 00:54:04.920
'Cause formally...

520
00:54:06.440 --> 00:54:07.840
this isn't my car.

521
00:54:07.920 --> 00:54:09.360
- Oh!
- Then whose is it?

522
00:54:10.200 --> 00:54:11.840
My friend's.

523
00:54:11.920 --> 00:54:16.680
I mean a distant friend... actually, really,
she's a complete stranger to me, yeah?

524
00:54:18.880 --> 00:54:20.360
How much?

525
00:54:20.440 --> 00:54:22.360
Sir, this car will be impounded.

526
00:54:22.440 --> 00:54:25.520
Please wait here while we contact the HQ.

527
00:54:32.760 --> 00:54:33.960
"How much?"

528
00:54:35.120 --> 00:54:37.640
POLICE

529
00:54:38.960 --> 00:54:41.040
Hello? Hello?

530
00:54:42.680 --> 00:54:45.440
- I think it's broken.
- You gotta press the button.

531
00:54:47.640 --> 00:54:50.480
Here 314, come in, 200.

532
00:54:59.720 --> 00:55:03.240
The car's definitely stolen.
We have to arrest him.

533
00:55:12.400 --> 00:55:15.160
- He's playing hard to get!
- Jesus.

534
00:55:26.760 --> 00:55:28.720
- I think I see him.
- Yeah, yeah.

535
00:55:29.760 --> 00:55:31.720
- I can't see him.
- Go right!

536
00:55:32.680 --> 00:55:34.960
- Or maybe left?
- No, no, right, right.

537
00:55:45.880 --> 00:55:47.880
- Here?
- What?

538
00:55:47.960 --> 00:55:50.440
- Here.
- That? That's a trash container.

539
00:55:50.520 --> 00:55:52.120
Really?

540
00:56:23.520 --> 00:56:26.176
You blocked someone, so I had to
move the car. He kept honking his horn.

541
00:56:26.200 --> 00:56:28.520
- What is this?
- What?

542
00:56:28.600 --> 00:56:30.240
It was like that this morning.

543
00:56:31.280 --> 00:56:34.040
- It was loose.
- Maksiu, get in, okay? It's warm inside.

544
00:56:36.960 --> 00:56:38.840
You wrecked my car!

545
00:56:40.720 --> 00:56:43.280
Okay, Marysia, I'll call a cab.
There's no time.

546
00:56:43.360 --> 00:56:46.320
You're not getting into
this car again. Goodbye.

547
00:56:46.400 --> 00:56:47.560
Oh, come on!

548
00:56:52.360 --> 00:56:53.840
Leave it!

549
00:56:55.840 --> 00:56:58.280
This is the worst day of my life.

550
00:57:02.120 --> 00:57:06.120
I take the subway to work.
I, I, I can't park!

551
00:57:08.040 --> 00:57:10.320
And I was rude and...

552
00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:18.960
We started off on the wrong foot, Marysia.

553
00:57:27.120 --> 00:57:28.480
I'm sorry.

554
00:57:33.840 --> 00:57:35.280
Is he coming with us?

555
00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:40.880
I don't really know.

556
00:57:40.960 --> 00:57:45.840
I wanted to... propose today,
but nothing is going as it should.

557
00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:49.240
Well, I have to agree with that.

558
00:57:49.320 --> 00:57:52.016
Before she died, Grandma promised me
that if I wanted to get married,

559
00:57:52.040 --> 00:57:54.800
Grandpa would give it to me for luck and...

560
00:57:54.880 --> 00:57:57.080
I really need that luck.

561
00:58:08.520 --> 00:58:09.640
Get in.

562
00:58:17.400 --> 00:58:18.880
Don't make me regret this.

563
00:58:24.960 --> 00:58:27.840
Mom, will there be
a gift when we get back?

564
00:58:29.480 --> 00:58:30.920
Yes, honey.

565
00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:35.760
Because I'm kinda hungry.
Could I have the "emergency" gummies?

566
00:58:36.600 --> 00:58:39.640
Sorry, Maks, but... I ate them.

567
00:58:40.920 --> 00:58:42.040
I have a candy bar.

568
00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:48.960
I don't like raisins.

569
00:58:52.320 --> 00:58:54.840
Then I'll... Cool, I'll eat the raisins.

570
00:58:55.800 --> 00:58:56.800
- Okay?
- Mhm.

571
00:59:18.600 --> 00:59:20.360
- Stop!
- What?

572
00:59:20.440 --> 00:59:22.600
- Stop the car! Turn off the lights.
- What?

573
00:59:22.680 --> 00:59:24.160
Kill the engine.

574
00:59:25.040 --> 00:59:27.480
- What? What's going on?
- Marysia, there's a squad car there.

575
00:59:27.720 --> 00:59:29.040
So what?

576
00:59:29.120 --> 00:59:31.040
Do you know
your technical inspection is overdue?

577
00:59:35.200 --> 00:59:36.680
How do you know that?

578
00:59:36.760 --> 00:59:40.000
I checked, uh,
your glove compartment out of boredom.

579
00:59:40.600 --> 00:59:41.880
Maks, get down.

580
00:59:43.640 --> 00:59:46.080
I'm really sorry, son.

581
00:59:46.160 --> 00:59:49.360
I'll get a chance to...
revise our plans, okay?

582
00:59:49.880 --> 00:59:52.680
Mom, this is better than normal Christmas!

583
00:59:54.440 --> 00:59:56.480
POLICE

584
00:59:57.080 --> 00:59:58.560
They are leaving.

585
00:59:58.640 --> 01:00:01.400
You're sticking out. Lay down.

586
01:00:01.480 --> 01:00:03.160
- What?
- Lay down.

587
01:00:23.360 --> 01:00:25.720
What are you doing there?
They've gone already.

588
01:00:50.680 --> 01:00:55.120
<i>Today in Bethlehem
There is good news</i>

589
01:00:56.200 --> 01:00:58.080
<i>There is good news</i>

590
01:01:14.040 --> 01:01:15.080
Michał?

591
01:01:22.840 --> 01:01:24.240
What are you doing there?

592
01:01:27.640 --> 01:01:28.840
The carburetor?

593
01:01:44.400 --> 01:01:49.080
'Cause sometimes I think...
that you come here to hide from me.

594
01:01:51.720 --> 01:01:52.800
No.

595
01:01:56.840 --> 01:01:59.400
I was actually happy
that there's going to be a baby.

596
01:02:00.200 --> 01:02:01.960
But maybe it's better this way.

597
01:02:02.040 --> 01:02:05.960
The boy has to mature.
It will happen by itself.

598
01:02:10.880 --> 01:02:14.080
The only thing
that happens by itself is rusting.

599
01:02:45.920 --> 01:02:49.480
- It's for your own good, Mirek.
- I know you'll manage.

600
01:02:57.160 --> 01:02:58.280
But today?

601
01:02:58.920 --> 01:03:00.920
There's never a good time.

602
01:03:33.240 --> 01:03:36.440
Maksiu... just this and one more place
and we're done, okay?

603
01:03:36.520 --> 01:03:39.160
- Should I go with you?
- If you want to.

604
01:03:42.400 --> 01:03:43.720
Okay.

605
01:03:44.640 --> 01:03:46.680
Well... it's Christmas Eve.

606
01:03:46.760 --> 01:03:50.320
Hold up. This is where
your or mine parcel is.

607
01:03:51.200 --> 01:03:53.800
There's a light on!

608
01:03:54.520 --> 01:03:56.240
Um, give me a leg up.

609
01:03:57.120 --> 01:03:59.240
- How?
- Normally, just crouch down.

610
01:04:00.440 --> 01:04:03.680
Okay. Let's do this.

611
01:04:09.320 --> 01:04:12.720
- Just stop wiggling around.
- Then get up. Get up now.

612
01:04:15.680 --> 01:04:19.360
- This isn't actually funny!
- Turn around! But I'm ticklish... wrong way!

613
01:04:19.440 --> 01:04:20.440
Where are you ticklish?

614
01:04:20.520 --> 01:04:23.120
- On... on my thighs!
- What?

615
01:04:23.200 --> 01:04:25.920
- Who has ticklish thighs?
- Well, I do!

616
01:04:28.680 --> 01:04:29.920
I am!

617
01:04:32.800 --> 01:04:35.720
- Oh, hello.
- Merry Christmas.

618
01:04:41.320 --> 01:04:43.040
This is the proper package.

619
01:04:43.680 --> 01:04:48.920
And... this package opened
the heart of a wonderful woman to me.

620
01:04:51.800 --> 01:04:54.280
Have you been... together long?

621
01:04:55.120 --> 01:04:57.720
Us? No.

622
01:04:57.800 --> 01:05:00.520
- No...
- No, it's a misunderstanding.

623
01:05:01.200 --> 01:05:05.680
Sometimes misunderstandings
are the start of wonderful things.

624
01:05:15.320 --> 01:05:17.080
I should go.

625
01:05:36.640 --> 01:05:40.040
Just a bit more...
and Zuza will be all yours.

626
01:05:52.960 --> 01:05:57.120
- Wasn't this supposed to be a ship?
- It will be once I find it.

627
01:05:57.200 --> 01:06:00.680
- And what is this?
- Mm... your lucky charm.

628
01:06:01.880 --> 01:06:04.320
- What charm?
- For luck.

629
01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.920
This was supposed to be
Grandma's ring for Zuza.

630
01:06:12.960 --> 01:06:15.720
So, we've... we've
misunderstood each other...

631
01:06:15.800 --> 01:06:18.560
But what... what's there to misunderstand?

632
01:06:19.240 --> 01:06:24.320
I don't know. Maybe Grandpa thought that...
this would do you more good.

633
01:06:26.480 --> 01:06:30.280
- Sorry, it's a dumb joke, I know...
- No, no, no. This has to be a mistake.

634
01:06:30.360 --> 01:06:33.520
There have to be other packages
somewhere that were...

635
01:06:33.600 --> 01:06:35.880
I don't know, misplaced.

636
01:06:35.960 --> 01:06:38.320
I was with Grandpa when he wrapped this.

637
01:06:39.640 --> 01:06:42.401
And you couldn't tell me that
all this time I've been chasing a prick?

638
01:06:42.440 --> 01:06:44.160
How was I to know
you were expecting a ring?

639
01:06:44.240 --> 01:06:46.960
Have you ever seen someone
propose with a cock?

640
01:06:47.560 --> 01:06:51.720
I'm sorry.
It seemed really plausible to me...

641
01:06:58.240 --> 01:06:59.800
No...

642
01:07:01.360 --> 01:07:03.240
This Christmas was supposed to be special.

643
01:07:03.320 --> 01:07:04.840
And it is.

644
01:07:17.640 --> 01:07:19.920
- <i>Santa, Santa!</i>
- Hello?

645
01:07:21.440 --> 01:07:23.600
See? It's not Santa.

646
01:07:23.680 --> 01:07:26.720
Just some chick and a dude.
Maybe they're selling wafers.

647
01:07:29.400 --> 01:07:31.960
Uh, hi. Is there an adult in the house?

648
01:07:32.040 --> 01:07:34.400
Mom's flight was cancelled.

649
01:07:34.480 --> 01:07:36.320
Dad went somewhere on a repair.

650
01:07:36.400 --> 01:07:38.960
I'm the oldest.

651
01:07:39.640 --> 01:07:44.000
I'm from the courier company. There was
a package on your doorstep this morning.

652
01:07:44.080 --> 01:07:46.160
Come in. I'll call Dad.

653
01:07:48.920 --> 01:07:50.080
Okay.

654
01:08:00.320 --> 01:08:02.920
What should I say?

655
01:08:05.320 --> 01:08:06.400
Nothing.

656
01:08:06.480 --> 01:08:08.840
You're in luck. The gift ended up...

657
01:08:08.920 --> 01:08:11.200
in the right hands.
But this package is for you as well.

658
01:08:14.560 --> 01:08:16.200
It's from mommy!

659
01:08:26.040 --> 01:08:27.880
Oh, no. Dammit. Not now, baby.

660
01:08:30.439 --> 01:08:33.600
- Gas?
- Diesel.

661
01:08:40.960 --> 01:08:43.920
Is there, uh, a station nearby?

662
01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.399
That way, but it's quite far from here.

663
01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:49.200
Okay...

664
01:08:51.120 --> 01:08:52.319
<i>Hello?</i>

665
01:08:52.399 --> 01:08:53.640
- Kama?
<i>- Hi.</i>

666
01:08:53.720 --> 01:08:57.359
I'm sorry for bothering you tonight,
darling, but there's a problem.

667
01:08:57.439 --> 01:08:59.439
Could you send me someone with a canister?

668
01:08:59.520 --> 01:09:01.240
<i>- I...</i>
- Hello?

669
01:09:03.560 --> 01:09:04.800
I can't believe it.

670
01:09:05.840 --> 01:09:10.200
Oh. Then maybe I'll use
my phone and call a taxi.

671
01:09:15.240 --> 01:09:17.200
No, it's... there's music playing.

672
01:09:18.920 --> 01:09:20.520
Fine, screw it.

673
01:09:21.120 --> 01:09:22.160
Meaning?

674
01:09:27.960 --> 01:09:29.640
I live there.

675
01:09:33.479 --> 01:09:35.696
I screwed up Maks' Christmas Eve.
I'll at least get him to bed.

676
01:09:35.720 --> 01:09:37.800
Can you lock up the car?
Just press the beeper, yeah?

677
01:09:38.600 --> 01:09:40.840
I'll carry Maks.

678
01:10:00.920 --> 01:10:04.400
Could you take this toy out of my pocket?

679
01:10:04.480 --> 01:10:06.440
Why? Does it hurt you?

680
01:10:23.960 --> 01:10:24.960
Okay.

681
01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:27.336
- Lay down him there.
- His jacket.

682
01:10:27.360 --> 01:10:28.640
Later.

683
01:10:39.520 --> 01:10:42.080
And what about his gift?

684
01:10:42.160 --> 01:10:45.360
I don't know. I'll give him some
knick-knack. I have some stashed away.

685
01:10:45.960 --> 01:10:48.680
I'll tell him the ship
didn't get here, because...

686
01:10:48.760 --> 01:10:52.560
the reindeer got a hernia,
and Santa got delayed.

687
01:10:55.080 --> 01:10:57.680
We don't always get what we want, huh?

688
01:11:02.960 --> 01:11:04.320
Wait a moment.

689
01:11:07.720 --> 01:11:09.040
You know what? 'Cause...

690
01:11:10.280 --> 01:11:12.520
you, you're...
you're probably tired too and... and I...

691
01:11:12.600 --> 01:11:13.800
FOR FOREVER

692
01:11:13.880 --> 01:11:17.240
my feet have been wet for an hour, so...

693
01:11:22.880 --> 01:11:24.080
Give it to Zuza.

694
01:11:32.240 --> 01:11:33.440
No...

695
01:11:34.040 --> 01:11:35.840
Give it to your Zuza.

696
01:11:36.920 --> 01:11:39.600
No, no, I'm sorry. I can't take it.

697
01:11:41.920 --> 01:11:44.920
Well... It might not be
from Grandma, but... it's quite nice.

698
01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:50.520
It's only catching dust here
and I... don't see any prospects for it.

699
01:11:52.320 --> 01:11:54.480
You'll propose... and it'll be great.

700
01:11:55.280 --> 01:12:00.080
Your friends will visit you and say:
"Wow... what a perfect couple".

701
01:12:01.480 --> 01:12:04.160
So sweet... it makes you sick.

702
01:12:07.480 --> 01:12:09.520
Go. You have something to do.

703
01:12:13.360 --> 01:12:14.560
Thank you.

704
01:12:29.160 --> 01:12:34.600
25TH DECEMBER

705
01:12:47.520 --> 01:12:50.080
- Hi.
- Hi, kid. May I?

706
01:13:07.360 --> 01:13:08.920
Is your mom in?

707
01:13:09.640 --> 01:13:10.680
No.

708
01:13:17.520 --> 01:13:19.040
Okay.

709
01:13:23.080 --> 01:13:26.080
SEVERAL HOURS EARLIER

710
01:13:37.560 --> 01:13:40.040
Who did you land yourself there?

711
01:13:41.040 --> 01:13:43.240
We saw him leave.

712
01:13:43.320 --> 01:13:46.160
You didn't brag about him. He's a cutie...

713
01:13:46.240 --> 01:13:49.240
Meh. His hair looked weird...

714
01:13:49.760 --> 01:13:53.520
No, it... That was nobody.

715
01:13:54.440 --> 01:13:58.800
So, you don't have any...
plans for the rest of the evening?

716
01:14:00.120 --> 01:14:02.000
And we... also have cake.

717
01:14:02.080 --> 01:14:04.720
- Come over. Come!
- Go.

718
01:14:07.400 --> 01:14:11.000
So, I tell him that
it doesn't matter what it's called.

719
01:14:11.080 --> 01:14:12.080
I don't know myself.

720
01:14:14.240 --> 01:14:17.560
But since we... started living together,

721
01:14:17.640 --> 01:14:20.160
it's been the most
beautiful time of my life.

722
01:14:23.280 --> 01:14:24.720
Here's to you!

723
01:14:30.840 --> 01:14:32.280
Are we expecting anyone?

724
01:14:38.040 --> 01:14:41.880
Kama? Come in! Come inside.

725
01:14:44.120 --> 01:14:45.960
- You're alive.
- I am.

726
01:14:46.040 --> 01:14:47.480
- Yeah.
- Kamila.

727
01:14:47.560 --> 01:14:49.560
What happened to your phone?

728
01:14:49.640 --> 01:14:53.400
- I was worried sick, girl!
- Sorry! I completely forgot.

729
01:14:53.480 --> 01:14:54.880
A gift.

730
01:14:54.960 --> 01:14:56.480
- What's that?
- Diesel.

731
01:15:08.920 --> 01:15:11.800
This year, I'm doing it. I checked.

732
01:15:11.880 --> 01:15:16.440
A plane to Malawi, then along the
Zambezi... all the way to Botswana.

733
01:15:16.520 --> 01:15:20.240
- Oh! Botswana?
- The wildest place on Earth.

734
01:15:20.320 --> 01:15:23.720
- That's my main New Year's resolution.
- Good luck!

735
01:15:23.800 --> 01:15:26.880
Your husband keeps saying
the same thing ever year and nothing!

736
01:15:27.480 --> 01:15:29.480
What about New Year's Eve?
You got any plans?

737
01:15:30.480 --> 01:15:31.920
Sex all night long.

738
01:15:34.400 --> 01:15:37.680
What are we doing, Ester? I don't recall.

739
01:15:40.240 --> 01:15:41.320
Is it that tailor?

740
01:15:47.680 --> 01:15:50.480
I want to feel that I'm still alive, Eryk.

741
01:16:05.760 --> 01:16:07.240
So, what now?

742
01:16:09.840 --> 01:16:11.480
Our whole life down the drain.

743
01:16:13.800 --> 01:16:15.840
You always wanted to travel.

744
01:16:17.400 --> 01:16:18.880
But you didn't.

745
01:16:20.400 --> 01:16:21.640
Go.

746
01:16:22.680 --> 01:16:27.440
Go to those giraffes,
antelopes, meerkats...

747
01:16:28.800 --> 01:16:32.920
- You think?
- I love you and I want you to be happy.

748
01:16:37.800 --> 01:16:38.920
What about you?

749
01:16:42.760 --> 01:16:44.920
I'll order another dress.

750
01:17:31.560 --> 01:17:33.680
Oh, there you are!

751
01:17:33.760 --> 01:17:38.240
'Cause I got off here and then went there.
But you weren't there and...

752
01:17:39.800 --> 01:17:41.600
- My folks' place is there.
- Okay.

753
01:17:47.160 --> 01:17:50.000
You invited me to your folks' place?

754
01:17:51.160 --> 01:17:52.960
Well, I live...

755
01:17:53.040 --> 01:17:57.040
I mean... I lived with my parents.

756
01:18:01.520 --> 01:18:04.560
Milena, what exactly did you send me, eh?

757
01:18:04.640 --> 01:18:07.840
So... you haven't seen it yet?

758
01:18:27.480 --> 01:18:30.640
Dude, you made a bet with me and I won.

759
01:18:30.720 --> 01:18:32.480
Now it's your turn to do a task.

760
01:18:39.640 --> 01:18:42.800
Marysia!

761
01:18:43.360 --> 01:18:45.560
Marysia!

762
01:19:19.680 --> 01:19:22.960
Hey. Hey. Hey.

763
01:19:23.760 --> 01:19:26.280
- What are you doing here?
- I'm loo-looking for you.

764
01:19:26.360 --> 01:19:28.080
Shouldn't you be home?

765
01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:32.040
I don't have a home.

766
01:19:32.120 --> 01:19:34.000
I live with my parents.

767
01:19:34.840 --> 01:19:36.520
I don't have anyone.

768
01:19:36.600 --> 01:19:39.880
- Easy. Come on, let's sit. Over there.
- Come on, come over there. Easy.

769
01:19:39.960 --> 01:19:42.280
I've lived with them...

770
01:19:43.440 --> 01:19:44.640
- for 38 years.
- Right.

771
01:19:44.720 --> 01:19:46.440
Uh, let's sit and talk.

772
01:19:46.520 --> 01:19:48.040
That's just life. Come on.

773
01:19:48.120 --> 01:19:49.800
- Marysia...
- Sit down.

774
01:19:49.880 --> 01:19:51.640
- Marysia...
- Yeah?

775
01:19:51.720 --> 01:19:53.760
- I need to tell you something.
- What?

776
01:19:55.320 --> 01:19:57.160
- Shoot.
- I changed around those packages.

777
01:20:01.360 --> 01:20:03.080
Why did you do that?

778
01:20:03.160 --> 01:20:04.160
'Cause I...

779
01:20:05.160 --> 01:20:06.840
'Cause I'm a lion.

780
01:20:13.040 --> 01:20:14.880
What you and I had was...

781
01:20:16.640 --> 01:20:17.680
it was fire.

782
01:20:18.280 --> 01:20:21.160
- What are you saying?
- When you left me...

783
01:20:21.240 --> 01:20:23.840
I know you think
I could have tons of women like that.

784
01:20:25.840 --> 01:20:27.120
But I don't.

785
01:20:28.240 --> 01:20:29.400
I'm sorry.

786
01:20:31.640 --> 01:20:35.560
You know what it means
to be... alone in the world.

787
01:20:50.800 --> 01:20:53.400
Uh, I met Santa in the parking lot.

788
01:20:55.400 --> 01:20:59.680
He asked about you and said that...
the reindeer, uh, has...

789
01:21:00.320 --> 01:21:03.480
a hernia. Mom told you, right?

790
01:21:03.560 --> 01:21:05.960
She said he had a bad hoof.

791
01:21:06.880 --> 01:21:09.600
Yeah. Yeah. A bad hoof.

792
01:21:09.680 --> 01:21:12.440
So... he didn't have time to wrap this.

793
01:21:13.440 --> 01:21:14.560
Here.

794
01:21:33.680 --> 01:21:35.680
No "Merry Christmas"?

795
01:21:38.040 --> 01:21:39.600
I didn't propose.

796
01:21:40.280 --> 01:21:41.960
We split up.

797
01:21:43.360 --> 01:21:47.640
Well... good riddance to bad boats.

798
01:21:47.720 --> 01:21:51.000
Just... a bit of compassion?

799
01:21:51.880 --> 01:21:53.160
For once.

800
01:21:53.240 --> 01:21:59.000
Oh... As they say:
The morning's rain and a girl's pain.

801
01:21:59.080 --> 01:22:01.160
Both don't last long.

802
01:22:23.840 --> 01:22:26.720
You had a pretty good childhood, right?

803
01:22:33.760 --> 01:22:35.040
What?

804
01:22:39.720 --> 01:22:43.160
What other kid had a monkey at home?

805
01:22:47.480 --> 01:22:49.320
Some had a monkey at home,

806
01:22:50.640 --> 01:22:53.120
others – a normal grandfather, huh?

807
01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:00.560
You know that...

808
01:23:01.560 --> 01:23:04.000
you can always stay here.

809
01:23:04.080 --> 01:23:06.440
That's still your room.

810
01:23:11.040 --> 01:23:12.240
Thanks.

811
01:24:00.240 --> 01:24:02.360
Where did all this come from?

812
01:24:02.440 --> 01:24:04.040
Krzysiek brought it.

813
01:24:05.200 --> 01:24:10.240
Yesterday, I lied to you and the captain.

814
01:24:10.320 --> 01:24:12.520
What's wrong, honey?

815
01:24:12.600 --> 01:24:17.000
I wanted a ship like this too,
so I took the smallest one.

816
01:24:17.080 --> 01:24:20.240
I didn't know I'd get more today.

817
01:24:20.320 --> 01:24:21.680
- You snatched it, mm?
- Yes.

818
01:24:24.400 --> 01:24:26.480
Come on. We'll escort Zbigniew home.

819
01:24:26.560 --> 01:24:29.440
You'll explain everything to me
on the way and we'll return the ship, hm?

820
01:24:41.680 --> 01:24:43.480
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

821
01:24:43.560 --> 01:24:46.960
We're here on, uh, a special task,

822
01:24:47.920 --> 01:24:50.560
What a beautiful schooner!

823
01:24:50.640 --> 01:24:54.000
I'm sorry. I... snatched it.

824
01:24:54.080 --> 01:24:55.480
Oh, it's mine!

825
01:24:56.200 --> 01:25:00.640
Don't worry about it.
I once stole too – a compass.

826
01:25:00.720 --> 01:25:04.280
But he shouldn't have done that, right?
Maks is very sorry.

827
01:25:04.360 --> 01:25:07.560
Nonsense!
A man has to get through life somehow.

828
01:25:07.640 --> 01:25:11.520
Here! As a gift from me, you sea dog.

829
01:25:12.440 --> 01:25:14.520
I've got tons of such junk.

830
01:25:14.600 --> 01:25:16.880
Come in, I'll show you.

831
01:25:16.960 --> 01:25:18.200
Tea?

832
01:25:20.560 --> 01:25:22.560
Only for a moment.

833
01:25:23.680 --> 01:25:26.640
You're probably busy with Christmas and...

834
01:25:26.720 --> 01:25:28.960
What are you talking about?

835
01:25:30.280 --> 01:25:34.320
My grandson is moving in
with me to guide me in my old age.

836
01:25:34.400 --> 01:25:35.440
Krzysiek?

837
01:25:36.440 --> 01:25:38.240
But... since when?

838
01:25:38.320 --> 01:25:41.600
Well... he's moving
out of his girlfriend's.

839
01:25:42.680 --> 01:25:44.720
He just went to get his stuff.

840
01:25:49.360 --> 01:25:52.720
Maybe a piece of this... cheese.

841
01:26:06.840 --> 01:26:09.160
You'll quickly get promoted.

842
01:26:11.320 --> 01:26:12.520
Yeah.

843
01:26:19.880 --> 01:26:21.480
That's my wish for you.

844
01:26:21.560 --> 01:26:25.320
For Christmas and... your whole life.

845
01:26:40.240 --> 01:26:42.880
- That's him! Bogdan, that's him!
- Okay, let's go.

846
01:26:46.760 --> 01:26:49.200
- Slowly, but surely.
- Mhm.

847
01:26:51.240 --> 01:26:54.640
Come on, switch on!
I got the controller wet.

848
01:27:26.720 --> 01:27:28.960
- Hello?
- Hello, hi. I'm calling, 'cause...

849
01:27:29.040 --> 01:27:31.960
<i>Right! Thanks for
standing in for the reindeer.</i>

850
01:27:32.040 --> 01:27:36.960
No. I'm really sorry, Marysia,
but there's a squad car after you.

851
01:27:38.720 --> 01:27:40.560
What is it with you and squad cars, huh?

852
01:27:40.640 --> 01:27:43.400
I haven't told you everything.
You're in serious trouble.

853
01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:45.760
Why am I in trouble?

854
01:27:47.160 --> 01:27:48.840
I-I'll explain everything in a sec...

855
01:27:50.480 --> 01:27:52.360
- Dammit!
- Hello?

856
01:28:06.360 --> 01:28:07.840
He-hello?

857
01:28:18.600 --> 01:28:19.760
Fuck it.

858
01:28:27.920 --> 01:28:28.920
POLICE

859
01:28:28.960 --> 01:28:30.920
Jan Maria Kwiecień.

860
01:28:34.480 --> 01:28:35.720
Mom!

861
01:28:46.640 --> 01:28:49.920
Officer Barbara Pasterz.
Please step out of the vehicle.

862
01:28:51.480 --> 01:28:53.816
So, Jan Maria Kwiecień
testifies that he did this for you...

863
01:28:53.840 --> 01:28:55.440
Maria Kwiecień!

864
01:28:55.520 --> 01:28:58.040
This lady i-i-is... is unfortunately right.

865
01:28:58.120 --> 01:28:59.456
And maybe I wanted
to help in the beginning,

866
01:28:59.480 --> 01:29:00.600
- but...
- Mom...

867
01:29:01.200 --> 01:29:03.280
Zbyszek is barely moving anymore.

868
01:29:04.400 --> 01:29:06.280
Why doesn't that fish have any water?

869
01:29:06.360 --> 01:29:09.360
It splashed out.
We were just on our way to the river.

870
01:29:10.400 --> 01:29:12.920
Listen, he won't make it much longer.

871
01:29:23.320 --> 01:29:25.840
- Release the animal and return.
- Ouch.

872
01:29:25.920 --> 01:29:27.360
And behave.

873
01:29:29.560 --> 01:29:31.280
You're being watched.

874
01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:33.320
Maks, you coming?

875
01:29:34.760 --> 01:29:36.480
<i>No, I'm staying here.</i>

876
01:29:47.760 --> 01:29:51.120
- What are you doing?
- So he gets used to the temperature.

877
01:29:51.200 --> 01:29:54.720
It's a carp.
He just adapts to new conditions.

878
01:29:54.800 --> 01:29:57.040
Yeah? Just like you.

879
01:30:00.760 --> 01:30:02.480
I've got something for you.

880
01:30:11.200 --> 01:30:12.920
I'll release him.

881
01:30:42.320 --> 01:30:45.120
It's not swimming away.
It's turning around?

882
01:30:45.200 --> 01:30:48.800
Zbyszek, wetness all around.
Reach out. Be happy.

883
01:30:50.800 --> 01:30:52.480
The new life awaits you.

884
01:30:53.880 --> 01:30:55.080
Go for it.

885
01:31:05.680 --> 01:31:06.680
Ouch.

886
01:31:21.560 --> 01:31:25.360
Damn. My fingers got... fat.

887
01:31:29.520 --> 01:31:30.960
You threw the ring away?!

888
01:31:31.040 --> 01:31:33.240
No. It slipped.

889
01:31:33.320 --> 01:31:34.800
Why did you do that?

890
01:31:37.560 --> 01:31:39.760
That was my emotional baggage.

891
01:31:40.640 --> 01:31:42.200
Yours too, kinda.

892
01:31:45.080 --> 01:31:47.400
We've got a <i>carte blanche</i> before us.

893
01:31:49.600 --> 01:31:51.880
<i>Carp blanche.</i>

894
01:33:07.080 --> 01:33:10.280
- It's unpacked yet.
- Hi, Daddy!

895
01:33:11.960 --> 01:33:14.040
Look, we have a Christmas tree!

896
01:33:14.120 --> 01:33:15.320
It comes together...

897
01:33:15.400 --> 01:33:17.320
<i>- Put Daddy on.</i>
- Daddy, it's Mom.

898
01:33:17.400 --> 01:33:18.680
Give me this.

899
01:33:19.280 --> 01:33:21.800
<i>Aren't we too old for this?</i>

900
01:33:21.880 --> 01:33:24.160
This is the most beautiful gift ever!

901
01:33:38.040 --> 01:33:40.480
I think we've gone crazy in our old age.

902
01:33:54.920 --> 01:33:57.520
See? There will be a wedding!

903
01:34:06.480 --> 01:34:07.720
Delicious!

904
01:34:10.560 --> 01:34:12.280
'Cause I've got experience.

905
01:38:19.120 --> 01:38:21.120
