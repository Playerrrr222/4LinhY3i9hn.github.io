00:06.876 --> 00:10.271
Good evening, everyone.
I'm Oprah Winfrey.

00:10.314 --> 00:13.535
Welcome to a spectacular
night here at

00:13.578 --> 00:16.059
the Griffith Observatory
in Los Angeles.

00:16.103 --> 00:20.368
Tonight you have
a front-row seat

00:20.411 --> 00:25.677
to a very special one-night-
only concert with Adele.

00:25.721 --> 00:29.072
She's singing all the songs
I know you want to hear,

00:29.116 --> 00:32.815
and new songs we've all
been waiting six years for.

00:32.858 --> 00:34.817
And throughout the night,

00:34.860 --> 00:38.299
you'll see my conversation
with Adele was so much fun.

00:38.342 --> 00:42.607
She's as real, as down to earth
as we all believe she is.

00:42.651 --> 00:47.612
But right now it is
my great delight to introduce

00:47.656 --> 00:53.575
the 15-time
Grammy-winning icon, Adele!

-Hiya.

it's beautiful.

for coming to join me here.

Well, actually because yes,

my tea house is here.
-Yes.

-Yes.

-And you start with "Hello."
-Yes. Well, I think

06:47.537 --> 06:49.321
I'm always going to have
to start with "Hello."

06:49.365 --> 06:51.323

07:10.995 --> 07:12.954
ADELE:
It does, yeah.

07:12.997 --> 07:15.609
So, what does it represent
to you?

07:15.652 --> 07:18.525
Well, the show is the
first time that I'll, you know,

07:18.568 --> 07:21.615
that I'm singing it
from where I am now.

07:21.658 --> 07:23.399
-Yes.
-Which I think is great.

07:23.443 --> 07:27.925
Um, the song to me
was the beginning of me

07:27.969 --> 07:29.579
trying to find myself
and I haven't figured out yet

07:29.623 --> 07:31.363
what it was that I had
to do for that.

07:31.407 --> 07:33.627
But when I wrote it,
it was a real ode to, like,

07:33.670 --> 07:35.237
little me, older me.

07:35.280 --> 07:37.326
Like, all of these things,
like, you know, so,

07:37.369 --> 07:39.502
it's just a song about, like,

07:39.546 --> 07:41.373
I'm still here.

07:41.417 --> 07:43.637
You know, sort of like, "Hi,
I'm still here. I still exist,

07:43.680 --> 07:45.508
like, you know,
in every aspect of my life."

07:45.552 --> 07:48.424
Well, it feels like that on 30,

07:48.468 --> 07:53.777
you have literally opened up
your soul in a way that

07:53.821 --> 07:56.519
even though we have
heard your pain before,

07:56.563 --> 08:00.088
it feels like pain was almost
like a muse for you for this.

08:00.131 --> 08:01.959
I read something you said--
you said,

08:02.003 --> 08:05.615
"I was singing things
I didn't even realize

08:05.659 --> 08:08.400
-I was feeling or thinking."
-Mm-hmm.

08:08.444 --> 08:10.664
So, is that how
the music comes to you?

08:10.707 --> 08:12.883
-Is that a part of your process?
-Yeah.

08:12.927 --> 08:15.146
Is the music as catharsis?

08:15.190 --> 08:17.975
Yeah, it definitely
channels from somewhere else.

08:18.019 --> 08:20.543
You know, when I'm singing
and when I'm writing, like...

08:20.587 --> 08:22.850
And I was kind of aware
of that on the other albums,

08:22.893 --> 08:24.852
but this one, you know,
a lot more

08:24.895 --> 08:27.158
I-I felt it because everything
was happening in real time.

08:27.202 --> 08:28.682
I was writing my album,
you know, while I was

08:28.725 --> 08:30.553
-going through everything.
-Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

08:30.597 --> 08:34.644
But I don't think as a person
I have what my singing has.

08:34.688 --> 08:36.385
-What do you mean?
-I just think there's-there's

08:36.428 --> 08:38.561
something I'm pulling from
somewhere else.

08:38.605 --> 08:40.563
I don't, I don't have some--
you know, something else

08:40.607 --> 08:42.522
from underneath.
I don't know what it is.

08:42.565 --> 08:44.567
It's coming up through me
but it's not...

08:44.611 --> 08:46.569
I don't know how I access it.
It's wild 'cause

08:46.613 --> 08:49.398
I don't think I'm that deep
in real life. [laughs]

08:49.441 --> 08:51.095
-So it's...
-But then you listen
to the music

08:51.139 --> 08:53.445
-and you think deep, right?
-Yeah. Yeah,

08:53.489 --> 08:55.012
you know,
or I'll just be like,

08:55.056 --> 08:57.406
"I am making progress,"
or like, just...

08:57.449 --> 08:59.408
It's-it's a revelation
to me, the songs.

08:59.451 --> 09:01.758
Well, I read something
that you said--

09:01.802 --> 09:03.978
you said, "I'm not shy
or embarrassed

09:04.021 --> 09:06.415
to be falling apart."

09:06.458 --> 09:09.244
That's one of the reasons why
you feel people are so connected

09:09.287 --> 09:14.597
to your music and I wondered,
what gives you...

09:14.641 --> 09:18.732
the-the freedom actually
and the courage to be able to

09:18.775 --> 09:23.606
fall apart and expose yourself
in a world and a culture now

09:23.650 --> 09:25.739
-that is a "gotcha" culture...
-Yeah, absolutely.

09:25.782 --> 09:27.741
...that if you make the wrong
move, you say the wrong thing...

09:27.784 --> 09:31.092
-Yeah.
-...somebody's got some,
you know, wisecrack about it.

09:31.135 --> 09:33.616
I think the reason
I'm so brave to do it, you know,

09:33.660 --> 09:36.880
in my career so far was because,
again, music helped me

09:36.924 --> 09:38.926
in any situations
and I would like to do,

09:38.969 --> 09:40.623
you know, the same for people

09:40.667 --> 09:42.233
that feel so alone when
they're feeling something.

09:42.277 --> 09:43.800
Mm-hmm.

09:43.844 --> 09:45.759
To be reminded that
they're not alone.

09:45.802 --> 09:48.631
And in terms of now,
you know, there were moments

09:48.675 --> 09:50.067
when I was writing the record or

09:50.111 --> 09:51.721
I would listen back to something
and be like,

09:51.765 --> 09:53.897
"That might be a bit
too private.

09:53.941 --> 09:56.160
"That might be a bit too,
you know,

09:56.204 --> 09:59.468
too about myself and stuff
to put out,"

09:59.511 --> 10:02.166
but nothing is as scary as what
I've been through

10:02.210 --> 10:04.255
over the last two, three years
behind closed doors.

10:04.299 --> 10:06.257
So I'm not frightened about...

10:06.301 --> 10:08.956
about what people may or
might not do now, you know.

comeback thing.

10:40.378 --> 10:42.250
Hang on, I got dry mouth.

of people that I know and love.

and not keeping myself busy.

20:53.948 --> 20:55.428
I used to always--
if a feeling came up,

20:55.471 --> 20:56.777
I'd distract myself
or I'd call a friend,

20:56.820 --> 20:58.039

"Do you wanna go out?

but I would just, I would just

21:05.176 --> 21:07.309
whenever I noticed
how I was feeling, I would

21:07.353 --> 21:08.397
sit down and I would sit in it.

21:08.441 --> 21:10.399
Um, I stopped drinking.

21:10.443 --> 21:14.142
That's one great way of,
um, of really sort of getting

21:14.185 --> 21:16.927

you know,

21:16.971 --> 21:19.016
just drinking water
and being sober as anything.

21:19.060 --> 21:22.193

21:30.811 --> 21:32.595

everything a couple years ago

21:32.639 --> 21:34.380
when I was going through
my divorce, yes.

21:34.423 --> 21:37.121
Um, not at the beginning.
At first I-- whew, no.

21:37.165 --> 21:39.689
I think I probably kept
the alcohol industry alive.

21:39.733 --> 21:41.691
But you know, after--
once I realized that I had

21:41.735 --> 21:43.345
a lot of work to do on myself,

21:43.389 --> 21:44.825
yeah, I stopped drinking and I

21:44.868 --> 21:46.217
started working out lots
and stuff like that

21:46.261 --> 21:48.219
to keep me sort of centered.

21:48.263 --> 21:50.352
Was there a moment
when you knew?

21:50.396 --> 21:52.876
Or was it a series of things
that you said,

21:52.920 --> 21:55.966
"Can't do this anymore"?

21:56.010 --> 21:58.012
With my-my journey or in...?

21:58.055 --> 22:00.231
With the divorce from Simon.
Like,

22:00.275 --> 22:02.059
because I-I, you know,

22:02.103 --> 22:04.801
over the years I've interviewed
so many people who stayed,

22:04.845 --> 22:06.977
were miserable, were miserable,

22:07.021 --> 22:10.807
and years before they
actually made the move...

22:10.851 --> 22:12.461
-Yeah.
-...had started
thinking about it,

22:12.505 --> 22:15.986
so I'm wondering, was there
a single moment or was...

22:17.423 --> 22:19.338
I do remember one of my friends,

22:19.381 --> 22:21.775
we were all-- we were
answering these questions

22:21.818 --> 22:24.386
-in this very bougie magazine.
-Mm-hmm.

22:24.430 --> 22:26.388
And it was,

22:26.432 --> 22:29.565
it was something like,
"What's something that

22:29.609 --> 22:31.393
no one would ever know
about you?"

22:31.437 --> 22:33.134
And I just said it in front of
three of my friends.

22:33.177 --> 22:35.092
I was like,
"I'm really not happy.

22:35.136 --> 22:36.442
"I'm not, I'm not living.

22:36.485 --> 22:38.531
I'm just plodding along."

22:38.574 --> 22:40.010
And I remember there was a lyric

22:40.054 --> 22:42.186
that I wrote that
I put on a song on-on 25,

22:42.230 --> 22:44.711
which was, "I want to live
and not just survive."

22:44.754 --> 22:46.147
-Mm-hmm.
-And, um,

22:46.190 --> 22:48.192
you know, I've definitely
felt like that,

22:48.236 --> 22:50.412
but it was when I, when
I admitted to my own friends,

22:50.456 --> 22:52.196
who thought I was really happy,

22:52.240 --> 22:54.547
that actually I'm really
unhappy, and they all gasped.

22:54.590 --> 22:56.592
Like, you know, I feel like it

22:56.636 --> 22:57.941
was sort of from there
that I was like,

22:57.985 --> 23:00.248
"What am I doing?
What am I doing it for?"

23:00.291 --> 23:03.207
You know?
But I think it was just,

23:03.251 --> 23:04.948
by us getting married,
us having our wedding,

23:04.992 --> 23:07.168
and I-- you know, I take
marriage very seriously.

23:07.211 --> 23:09.300
-Like, it obviously
seems like...
-Yeah, 'cause you have

23:09.344 --> 23:11.215
-all that stuff from the past.
-Yeah, and it seems
like I don't,

23:11.259 --> 23:13.479
you know, now-- like, you know,
almost like I disrespected it

23:13.522 --> 23:16.003
by-by getting married,
and then, you know,

23:16.046 --> 23:17.657
divorced so quickly
and stuff like that.

23:17.700 --> 23:19.876
But I think...

23:19.920 --> 23:22.183
Are embarrassed because it
was so quickly?

23:22.226 --> 23:23.663
I'm just embarrassed that
I didn't make my marriage work.

23:23.706 --> 23:24.968
-Okay.
-You know?

23:25.012 --> 23:26.709
So now that you have perspective

23:26.753 --> 23:28.276
and you've opened up your soul

23:28.319 --> 23:30.974
and shared it with the world
here on 30,

23:31.018 --> 23:32.976

23:33.020 --> 23:35.892
is the real reason Simon came
into your life?

23:35.936 --> 23:37.981
I think Simon probably saved
my life, to be honest with you.

23:38.025 --> 23:39.809
He came at such a moment,

23:39.853 --> 23:44.814
where the stability that
him and Angelo have given me,

23:44.858 --> 23:46.816
no one else would ever have
been able to give me,

23:46.860 --> 23:49.776
like, especially at that time
in my life-- I was so young

23:49.819 --> 23:52.779
and I just, I think I would have
got a bit lost in all of it.

23:52.822 --> 23:54.955
Like, you know,
and I think I probably,

23:54.998 --> 23:57.000
I could have easily gone down
some dodgy paths,

23:57.044 --> 23:58.349
like, you know?

23:58.393 --> 24:00.177
And sort of self-destructed
from-from

24:00.221 --> 24:03.920
sort of like being so
overwhelmed by all of it.

24:03.964 --> 24:07.489
And he-he came in
and was stable.

24:07.533 --> 24:09.491
The most stable person I've ever

24:09.535 --> 24:11.275
had in my life up
until that point.

24:11.319 --> 24:13.364
Even-- you know, even now
I trust him with my life.

24:13.408 --> 24:15.454
-Really?
-Oh, my gosh, like beyond.

24:15.497 --> 24:18.152
Like, yeah, I feel like...

24:18.195 --> 24:20.371
Yeah, him and Angelo,
like, they were

24:20.415 --> 24:23.374
angels sent to me,
that's how I feel.

24:23.418 --> 24:25.202
-So, came into your life...
-Mm-hmm.

24:25.246 --> 24:27.291
...at the right season
and for the right reasons.

24:27.335 --> 24:28.902
-To save you.
-Yes, absolutely, yeah.

24:28.945 --> 24:32.166
And in that moment when
Angelo said to you,

24:32.209 --> 24:35.212
"Why don't
you love Daddy anymore?"

24:35.256 --> 24:37.084
Yeah, that was really hard
as well, and trying to explain

24:37.127 --> 24:40.217
to, like, a six-year-old
at the time, obviously,

24:40.261 --> 24:43.394
um, that I do love him,
I'm just not in love with him.

24:43.438 --> 24:45.484
Makes absolutely no sense
to a six-year-old.

24:45.527 --> 24:46.833
Like, you know?

24:46.876 --> 24:48.704
So there were so many answers
I just

24:48.748 --> 24:51.228
couldn't give him
'cause there aren't any really.

24:51.272 --> 24:53.535
Like, you know,
that he would understand,

24:53.579 --> 24:55.755
but he sees
that I still love his dad.

24:55.798 --> 24:57.583
-Like, you know...
-'Cause you live across
the street from each other.

24:57.626 --> 24:59.541
We live across the street from
each other. Like, we, like,

24:59.585 --> 25:03.066
we're away together sometimes,
like, you know, and, um, and...

25:03.110 --> 25:05.634
Yeah, like, me and Simon also
chat away without Angelo.

25:05.678 --> 25:07.680
Like, Angelo, you know,
could be at school and...

25:07.723 --> 25:08.811
So you're still friends?

25:08.855 --> 25:10.334
-Oh, yes.
-It's all...

25:10.378 --> 25:11.684

25:11.727 --> 25:14.208

I mean, we don't sit around

[cheering]

40:45.138 --> 40:46.792
Thank you very much.

40:51.057 --> 40:53.102
You know, um...

40:53.146 --> 40:55.235
this is the first time--
I got to perch like this

40:55.278 --> 40:57.324
since I can't sit
in this mermaid dress.

40:57.367 --> 40:59.021
[laughter]

40:59.065 --> 41:01.894
I feel like my whole campaign
so far with my outfits

41:01.937 --> 41:04.679
is a bit Death Becomes Her.

41:04.723 --> 41:09.641
Sometimes I'm Hel
and sometimes I'm Mad, you know.

41:09.684 --> 41:11.991
Anyway, this is the first time
that my son

41:12.034 --> 41:13.340
has ever seen me perform.

41:13.383 --> 41:14.994
-[cheering]
-And I got really--

41:15.037 --> 41:16.604
Oh, and he dressed up for me.

41:16.648 --> 41:18.432
It was-- I'm not gonna cry.
Anyway, it's too...

41:18.476 --> 41:21.304
it's too soon to cry and I don't
want anyone to come fix my face.

41:21.348 --> 41:24.090
But, um, it's the absolute
honor of my life, baby,

41:24.133 --> 41:26.005
to have you here tonight.

41:26.048 --> 41:28.181
And you look so beautiful,
and so handsome and smart.

41:28.224 --> 41:29.791
[cheering]

41:29.835 --> 41:33.360
OPRAH:
So many women, Adele,

41:33.403 --> 41:35.014
are going to be liberated,
I think,

41:35.057 --> 41:40.236
by listening to you
because so many

41:40.280 --> 41:43.152
women specifically
choose to stay on

41:43.196 --> 41:45.807
in relationships when

41:45.851 --> 41:48.549
they know it's not working,
and they do it for the kids.

41:48.593 --> 41:54.076
And I've read where you said you
weren't miserablemiserable,

41:54.120 --> 41:56.426
-but you also knew you
weren't happy.
-Yeah.

41:56.470 --> 41:59.734
And so, you wanted to bring
a happy version

41:59.778 --> 42:01.910
-of yourself to your son.
-Mm-hmm.

42:01.954 --> 42:04.086
-Yes.
-Which I think is about

42:04.130 --> 42:06.306
the best gift anybody
can give to their children.

42:06.349 --> 42:08.961
I think, I think
it's the same as,

42:09.004 --> 42:11.354
you know, the same drive
as staying in a relationship

42:11.398 --> 42:13.400
even though you're not happy
and you do it for the kids,

42:13.443 --> 42:14.749
I think it's as loving

42:14.793 --> 42:16.403
as doing that for the kids
by leaving

42:16.446 --> 42:18.710
and-and, you know,
finding your own happiness

42:18.753 --> 42:21.190
so that they really know
who you are.

42:21.234 --> 42:23.715
But I'm still not fully over it,

42:23.758 --> 42:27.545
of me choosing to dismantle
my child's life

42:27.588 --> 42:29.372
-for my own...
-Mm-hmm.

42:29.416 --> 42:31.244
...makes me very uncomfortable.

42:31.287 --> 42:32.593
You still feel guilt?

42:32.637 --> 42:35.727
I don't feel guilt,
I just feel...

42:35.770 --> 42:38.425
somewhat selfish sometimes,
but, like, I-I know that

42:38.468 --> 42:40.906
I'm-I'm nearing my goal
of, like,

42:40.949 --> 42:42.864
finding my happiness,
like, you know.

42:42.908 --> 42:44.779
And it's been--
no one ever makes me

42:44.823 --> 42:46.476
do anything I don't want
and it was just like--

42:46.520 --> 42:48.435
but I was really
ignoring myself.

42:48.478 --> 42:50.611
-Yeah.
-For a long time,
which was wild to me

42:50.655 --> 42:52.004
when I realized it;
and I knew

42:52.047 --> 42:54.615
that as an adult,
Angelo would be livid

42:54.659 --> 42:56.356
-with me for doing that.
-Mm-hmm.

42:56.399 --> 42:58.184
I knew that when
he became an adult,

42:58.227 --> 43:01.579
that he'd be furious at me
and I didn't want that, either.

43:01.622 --> 43:03.015
But it was, it was,
it was hard work.

43:03.058 --> 43:04.712
So, this whole album
is dedicated to him.

43:04.756 --> 43:07.149
Yes. Yeah, and the whole album

43:07.193 --> 43:09.369
is not about him, it's about me.

43:09.412 --> 43:12.198
And I just wanted for him
to hear me

43:12.241 --> 43:14.766
talking mad-- madly deeply,

43:14.809 --> 43:17.551
about who I am and how I feel,
like, you know.

43:17.595 --> 43:19.205
And I don't know if I'd ever be
able to have that conversation

43:19.248 --> 43:21.468
with him in real life,
so therefore he can go

43:21.511 --> 43:23.165
and listen to it.

43:23.209 --> 43:25.385
Well, everything on the album
is certainly a starter

43:25.428 --> 43:26.734
for a great conversation.

43:26.778 --> 43:30.738
So, does Angelo know that
you are Adele?

43:30.782 --> 43:33.393
No, apart from the other day,

43:33.436 --> 43:34.873
he watched
the "Easy on Me" video--

43:34.916 --> 43:36.657
like countdown
to when it premiered.

43:36.701 --> 43:39.312
-Yeah.
-Wherever, whatever.
I didn't watch that.

43:39.355 --> 43:41.227
And, um, he was like,
"There was, like,

43:41.270 --> 43:43.969
150,000 people waiting,"
and, like, blah-blah-blah.

43:44.012 --> 43:46.493
And he was like,
"You had all these likes."

43:46.536 --> 43:48.582
And then he read
the comments and then...

43:48.626 --> 43:50.323
he was like,
"People really like you."

43:50.366 --> 43:52.151
Like, so he's-he's starting...

43:52.194 --> 43:54.719
-Starting to get it?
-...to get it a little bit,

43:54.762 --> 43:56.546
-but not really.
-Didn't you take him

43:56.590 --> 43:58.026
to a Taylor Swift concert
and he was like...

43:58.070 --> 43:59.724
He loved it.

43:59.767 --> 44:01.421
He couldn't believe that
all those people were in there?

44:01.464 --> 44:03.336
Yeah, because he used to come
to my stadium shows

44:03.379 --> 44:05.425
for my rehearsals
and it would be empty.

44:05.468 --> 44:08.210
He was like, "So many people
come to her shows."

44:08.254 --> 44:10.082
[laughs] But I'd make him leave
before they all arrive.

44:10.125 --> 44:13.302
It was so cute and so funny;
he loved it, yeah.

44:13.346 --> 44:15.000
-He's never seen you
perform live?
-No.

44:15.043 --> 44:18.133
-No, this will be
his first time.
-Wow.

44:18.177 --> 44:20.092
-Yeah.
-Yes. Do you
want more children?

44:20.135 --> 44:22.703
I'm-I'm definitely open to it.

44:22.747 --> 44:24.662
I would like more children.
It wouldn't be the end

44:24.705 --> 44:26.620
of the world
if I don't have them,

44:26.664 --> 44:29.362
'cause I have Angelo,
but yeah, I think so.

44:29.405 --> 44:33.279
Every mother and father has
a dream for their children.

44:33.322 --> 44:38.023
And even when you have a big,
accessed life as you do,

44:38.066 --> 44:40.112
and can give your children
any dreams that

44:40.155 --> 44:41.287
-they can imagine...
-Yeah.

44:41.330 --> 44:42.680
...actually I think

44:42.723 --> 44:45.204
it's more challenging
to raise children

44:45.247 --> 44:47.249
who are kind
and have their own ambition...

44:47.293 --> 44:49.730
-Yeah. Absolutely.
-...when they have you.

44:49.774 --> 44:53.125
So, what is the dream
you hold for him?

44:53.168 --> 44:56.128
Just to be a good person,
be a good and happy person.

44:56.171 --> 44:58.957
That's it.
I don't expect anything of him.

44:59.000 --> 45:02.308
I don't care what his career is,
as long as he's passionate about

45:02.351 --> 45:05.572
whatever it is that he does
and that he's happy.

45:10.142 --> 45:12.884
[cheering]

45:12.927 --> 45:15.756
So now this is the big surprise
and I'm very, very excited.

45:15.800 --> 45:17.627
I hope we can pull it off.

45:17.671 --> 45:22.545
So, tonight we've arranged...

45:22.589 --> 45:25.374
I'm a bit nervous in case
it doesn't go well.

45:25.418 --> 45:27.463
It's also a bit ironic
that I'm-- that I'm

45:27.507 --> 45:29.901
letting this happen tonight.
We've arranged a surprise

45:29.944 --> 45:32.120
for a lovely guy called Quentin,

45:32.164 --> 45:36.908
who reached out to a, now,
fake show asking for some help,

45:36.951 --> 45:40.128
so... whew,
make me all nervous.

45:40.172 --> 45:41.651
Quentin has been
with his girlfriend Ashley

45:41.695 --> 45:43.131
for seven years.

45:43.175 --> 45:44.785
Seven years is, like,
normally like, you know,

45:44.829 --> 45:47.135
you either say yes or you say no
to, like, life together.

45:47.179 --> 45:48.484
Seven-year itch.

45:48.528 --> 45:50.225
She's a chef--
she's a vegan chef.

45:50.269 --> 45:52.793
She's always at work,
but tonight Quentin told Ashley

45:52.837 --> 45:55.448
that they were having
a date night and so

45:55.491 --> 45:57.450
we're going to make
that date night really,

45:57.493 --> 46:00.235
really memorable.
So now, earlier today

46:00.279 --> 46:02.455
Ashley and Quentin
were picked up in a car.

46:02.498 --> 46:05.110
And they came to this park,
to Griffith Park,

46:05.153 --> 46:07.199
and at the bottom of the hill
down there they've been

46:07.242 --> 46:09.592
having a beautiful picnic
pretty much all day.

46:09.636 --> 46:11.769
Quentin told Ashley that he's
planned a small surprise to

46:11.812 --> 46:15.511
celebrate the fact that she just
got her first big catering job.

46:15.555 --> 46:17.078
Also, I love a surprise.

46:17.122 --> 46:19.515
Also love dress-up.
Right, so she--

46:19.559 --> 46:21.996
blindfolded her--
bit kinky but you know--

46:22.040 --> 46:24.129
and he's given her
noise-canceling headphones

46:24.172 --> 46:27.349
so that she can't hear what
we've been doing up here,

46:27.393 --> 46:29.003
this concert tonight.

46:29.047 --> 46:30.439
And even though
they're in the area,

46:30.483 --> 46:32.180
she has absolutely no idea
where she is

46:32.224 --> 46:35.357
or where she's going, so...

46:35.401 --> 46:38.099
I need every single person
to be really bloody quiet.

46:38.143 --> 46:39.797
All right?

46:39.840 --> 46:41.276
[mouthing]

46:41.320 --> 46:43.452
Let's turn the lights down.
If you, if you

46:43.496 --> 46:44.845
make a noise,
I'm going to kill you.

46:44.889 --> 46:45.846
[whispering]:
Turn the lights down.

46:45.890 --> 46:47.587
Turn the lights down.

46:56.639 --> 46:59.251
What are we doing, Quentin?

47:13.700 --> 47:16.094
-All right, listen.
-[laughs]: Okay.

47:16.137 --> 47:18.270
Take the blindfold off, okay?

47:18.313 --> 47:19.793
When you squeeze my hand?

47:19.837 --> 47:22.404
-Yes.
-Am I on grass?

47:22.448 --> 47:23.884
-Shh.
-Oh, shoot.

47:23.928 --> 47:25.886
[soft laughter]

47:25.930 --> 47:26.974
Quentin...

47:28.193 --> 47:30.978
Take it off? Take it off?

47:31.022 --> 47:32.762
-Oh...
-Babe, look at me.

47:32.806 --> 47:34.852
Look at me, look at me,
look at me, look at me.

47:34.895 --> 47:35.896
-Look at me.
-Oh, my God.

47:35.940 --> 47:37.376
Look at me.

47:37.419 --> 47:38.986
Listen.
[chuckles]

47:39.030 --> 47:41.162
-First of all... Listen.
-What are you doing?

47:41.206 --> 47:45.558
Listen, I want to
say thank you, okay?

47:45.601 --> 47:46.994
What are you doing?

47:47.038 --> 47:48.387
I want to thank you
for being so patient

47:48.430 --> 47:49.867
-with me.
-Oh, Quentin Brunson...

47:49.910 --> 47:52.913
Listen, thank you
for being patient with me.

47:52.957 --> 47:54.915
-Um...
-[both laugh]

47:54.959 --> 47:58.527
-You're crazy, man.
-I am extremely proud of you.

47:58.571 --> 48:02.009
And, I mean, every day
you blow my mind.

48:02.053 --> 48:04.098
Oh, my God.
Where are we?

48:04.142 --> 48:08.189
There's absolutely nothing
that you cannot do.

48:08.233 --> 48:09.974
And I just know
that you're going to be

48:10.017 --> 48:12.628
an amazing mother
to our kids one day.

48:12.672 --> 48:14.282
[laughs]

48:14.326 --> 48:17.851
And, um...

48:17.895 --> 48:19.722
-And I love you.
-Is this real?

48:19.766 --> 48:22.160
[laughs]
I love you. I love you.

48:22.203 --> 48:25.946
I love you.
And I will continue to love you

53:34.472 --> 53:35.864
certainly is this whole
weight thing.

53:35.908 --> 53:38.040
-Mm-hmm.
-And you lost

53:38.084 --> 53:40.391
-a hundred pounds in two years.
-Around that, yeah.

53:40.434 --> 53:42.262
-Around that?
A hundred pounds in two years.
-Around, yeah.

And then you said it wasn't
even really about the weight.

53:45.004 --> 53:46.484
-No.
-So what was it about?

53:46.527 --> 53:48.660
It was about my anxiety mainly.

53:48.703 --> 53:52.141
I had the most terrifying
anxiety attacks

53:52.185 --> 53:53.621
after I left my marriage.

53:53.665 --> 53:55.710
They'd paralyze me completely

53:55.754 --> 53:57.799
and made me so confused
because I wouldn't be

53:57.843 --> 53:59.497
able to have any control
over my body.

53:59.540 --> 54:02.717
But I knew that I-I was aware
of it all happening.

54:02.761 --> 54:04.850
It was like I was still
very much there

54:04.893 --> 54:07.548
while my whole body was just,
like, on another planet

54:07.592 --> 54:08.810
it felt like, you know?

54:08.854 --> 54:10.290
And I've always
worked out a bit.

54:10.334 --> 54:11.639
You know, a couple times
a week for my back.

54:11.683 --> 54:14.033
-Not very hard. But you know.
-Uh-huh.

54:14.076 --> 54:15.861
'Cause I've had a bad back
since I was a teenager.

54:15.904 --> 54:19.343
And I started to notice
A] how much I trusted

54:19.386 --> 54:22.302
my trainer and his,
like, presence

54:22.346 --> 54:24.870
when I was feeling so lost,
but also that I didn't have

54:24.913 --> 54:26.741
any anxiety when I was
with him at the gym.

54:26.785 --> 54:28.787
So then I-I picked it up
every day and then

54:28.830 --> 54:31.311
I had nothing else to do,
and I think

54:31.355 --> 54:33.270
it was just, it became my time.

54:33.313 --> 54:35.881
Me having a plan every day
when I had no plans.

54:35.924 --> 54:37.535
I had no idea what each day
was going to bring

54:37.578 --> 54:39.232
for me but me knowing that,

54:39.276 --> 54:41.103
okay, at 9:00 a.m.,
I'm gonna go to the gym.

54:41.147 --> 54:42.757
Okay, great. Well,
that gives me some discipline.

54:42.801 --> 54:44.455
Okay, 1:00 p.m. I'm going
to go for a hike.

54:44.498 --> 54:47.371
You know, having these
sort of pins in my day

54:47.414 --> 54:49.329
-helped me keep myself together.
-So you weren't even

54:49.373 --> 54:51.288
starting out
trying to lose weight?

54:51.331 --> 54:52.593
No, not at all.

54:52.637 --> 54:54.682
I wasn't bothered
about that at all but...

54:54.726 --> 54:58.338
in that process of having, you
know, lost all of that weight,

54:58.382 --> 55:00.732
I definitely
really contributed towards

55:00.775 --> 55:02.124
me getting my mind right,
you know.

55:02.168 --> 55:03.865
-It did.
-And giving me the-- absolutely.

55:03.909 --> 55:05.171
It sharpened everything.

55:05.214 --> 55:06.433
Without a shadow of a doubt.

55:06.477 --> 55:08.348
Like, it gave me real purpose.

55:08.392 --> 55:10.698
Interesting, because you know,
I-I've been through this a few

55:10.742 --> 55:13.353
times myself and I remember
the first time I dropped,

55:13.397 --> 55:16.617
you know, a lot of weight--
I think it was like 67 pounds--

55:16.661 --> 55:18.837
people were really upset
and had stuff to say.

55:18.880 --> 55:21.274
And it actually in many ways
felt like I had abandoned them

55:21.318 --> 55:23.494
-or something.
-Mm-hmm. Yeah.

55:23.537 --> 55:26.584
And lots of people
are talking about your weight

55:26.627 --> 55:28.542
and all in your business
about it.

55:28.586 --> 55:30.022
-Yeah.
-And I want to know,

55:30.065 --> 55:31.806
what is the experience
of losing this

55:31.850 --> 55:34.809
been like for you and also
people's reaction to it?

55:34.853 --> 55:38.422
I'm not shocked or even
fazed by it because

55:38.465 --> 55:40.815
my body has been objectified
my entire career.

55:40.859 --> 55:42.817
I'm either too big,
I'm either too small.

55:42.861 --> 55:44.558
Like, you know, I'm either
hot or I'm either not--

55:44.602 --> 55:46.430
like, whatever.
I never looked up to anyone

55:46.473 --> 55:48.040
because of their body.

55:48.083 --> 55:51.173
You know, I never admired
anyone because they had

55:51.217 --> 55:53.828
the same hair color as me
or the same style as me.

55:53.872 --> 55:55.830
-Or, you know, whatever, so...
-Or were the same weight as you.

55:55.874 --> 55:57.832
Never. Never, ever, ever.

55:57.876 --> 55:59.878
And when you were heavier,
you were fine.

55:59.921 --> 56:01.401
I was and I was
body positive then

56:01.445 --> 56:02.881
and I'm body positive now.

56:02.924 --> 56:05.492
But it's not my job to
validate how people feel

56:05.536 --> 56:07.233
-about their bodies.
-Whoo.

56:07.276 --> 56:10.149
And I feel bad that, you know,
it's made anyone feel

56:10.192 --> 56:12.369
horrible about themselves,
but I--

56:12.412 --> 56:15.589
that's not my job
and I-I can't...

56:15.633 --> 56:17.243
I'm trying to sort
my own life out.

56:17.286 --> 56:19.114
-You know, I can't...
-[laughs]

56:19.158 --> 56:21.247
I can't add another worry and
another thing to try and nail.

56:21.290 --> 56:23.380
-I can't, like, you know?
-Okay.

56:23.423 --> 56:24.990
-And...
-I got that, I love that.

56:25.033 --> 56:26.513
-Yeah.
-I love that. I love that.

56:26.557 --> 56:28.341
And, you know, my-my weight
might fluctuate

56:28.385 --> 56:29.777
now that I can't work out as
much and I'm on set all day.

56:29.821 --> 56:31.431
You know, I mean, I'm eating.

56:31.475 --> 56:33.215
But I don't care if
I put on weight.

56:33.259 --> 56:34.739
I don't care if I lose it again.
Like, it's not about that.

56:34.782 --> 56:37.306
As long as, like,
my muscle memory doesn't go

56:37.350 --> 56:39.613
for when I'm lifting my weights,
which is,

56:39.657 --> 56:41.398
like my favorite place to be.

56:41.441 --> 56:43.487
-Lifting weights? Okay.
-I love it.

56:43.530 --> 56:46.446
-I love it. I love it.
-What's the highest
weight you can press now?

56:46.490 --> 56:48.143
Well, at the moment,
my back's been bad,

56:48.187 --> 56:49.841
but last summer when
I was at my--

56:49.884 --> 56:51.886
I was at my peak
of being able to like--

56:51.930 --> 56:53.714
I felt like I could
have been in the Olympics.

56:53.758 --> 56:55.237
I remember saying to my trainers
all the time, "I'm gonna get,

56:55.281 --> 56:57.065
I'm gonna get an Olympic
gold medal next."

56:57.109 --> 56:58.676
-I was like, you know.
-[laughs]

56:58.719 --> 57:00.852
It was-- we were getting to,
like, on a deadlift,

57:00.895 --> 57:04.377
we were getting up to,
like, 160, 170.

57:04.421 --> 57:05.944
Yeah, I love it.

57:05.987 --> 57:08.294
But it started out
at ten pounds.

57:08.337 --> 57:10.731
It started at ten pounds when
I first started lifting.

57:10.775 --> 57:12.472
I am... Wow.

57:12.516 --> 57:14.474
Oh, no, I'm--
I'm an athlete.

57:14.518 --> 57:17.651
I'm actually an athlete.
Like, I'm not even boasting.

57:17.695 --> 57:19.436
Even the proportions of my body.

57:19.479 --> 57:21.481
I should have been an athlete,
if only at school

57:21.525 --> 57:23.178
hadn't discovered boys
and someone had told me

57:23.222 --> 57:25.572
to go and do a bit more P.E.

57:25.616 --> 57:28.314
Wow. 160, wow.

57:28.357 --> 57:30.098
Yeah. I love it.

57:30.142 --> 57:31.317
But I have to eat
quite a lot of food

57:31.360 --> 57:32.666
to lift the weights I lift.

57:32.710 --> 57:34.407
-So you eat?
-I eat.

57:34.451 --> 57:35.669
-Oh, yeah.
-What you want to eat?

57:35.713 --> 57:37.236
-I had Chinese last night.
-Okay.

57:37.279 --> 57:38.759
Yeah, we found the best
McDonald's recently.

57:41.675 --> 57:43.634
No, I do. I love it.

57:43.677 --> 57:45.070
I ain't got much
of a sweet tooth though.

57:45.113 --> 57:46.288
Yeah, I don't either.
Yeah, yeah.

57:46.332 --> 57:47.594

57:49.727 --> 57:51.206
-Yeah.
-She's an athlete.

57:51.250 --> 57:52.686
I'm also a very good boxer.

57:52.730 --> 57:54.340
I've got a left hook that
could kill you.

"The harder that I try,
I regress.

58:17.581 --> 58:20.235
"I am my own worst enemy.

58:20.279 --> 58:22.760
"Right now I truly hate
being me.

58:22.803 --> 58:25.806
"Every day feels like the road
I'm on might just open up

58:25.850 --> 58:27.634
"and swallow me whole.

58:27.678 --> 58:30.376
"How do I feel so mighty small
when I'm struggling

58:30.419 --> 58:32.552

58:35.250 --> 58:36.817
-You can write.
-Thank you.

58:36.861 --> 58:39.777
So what was going on there?
What was happening?

58:39.820 --> 58:43.171
How did you keep the faith when
you were at your lowest point?

58:43.215 --> 58:44.782
-What were you holding on to?
-My friends.

58:44.825 --> 58:46.784
The question is,
what were you holding on to?

58:46.827 --> 58:49.264
Um, my-my friends
always would say,

58:49.308 --> 58:51.179
"hold on" when I would feel like

58:51.223 --> 58:53.007
how I'm-- you know,
the lyrics in the verse.

58:53.051 --> 58:56.576
-Mm-hmm.
-But it was just exhausting,

58:56.620 --> 59:01.450
trying to... to-to,
like, keep going with it.

59:01.494 --> 59:03.583
It's a process, you know;
the process

59:03.627 --> 59:06.934
of-of a divorce;
the process of, you know,

59:06.978 --> 59:09.415
being a single parent;
the process of not

59:09.458 --> 59:10.851
seeing your child
every single day

59:10.895 --> 59:12.374
wasn't really a plan that I had

59:12.418 --> 59:14.594
when I, you know, when I,
when I became a mum;

59:14.638 --> 59:17.554
um, the process of arriving for
yourself every single day,

59:17.597 --> 59:19.556
turning up for yourself
every single day

59:19.599 --> 59:21.296
and still running a home,
running a business.

59:21.340 --> 59:23.211
Like, it's-it's, you know,
so many people

59:23.255 --> 59:25.170
know what I'm talking about
and it can--

59:25.213 --> 59:26.693
you know,
I feel like that as well.

59:26.737 --> 59:28.739
I-I juggle those things as well.

59:28.782 --> 59:32.307
And it just-- I felt like
not doing it anymore,

59:32.351 --> 59:34.658
and also trying to, like,

59:34.701 --> 59:38.487
move forward, like...

59:38.531 --> 59:40.925
but, like, with intention,

59:40.968 --> 59:43.710
not just trying to get out of it
for no reason.

59:43.754 --> 59:46.278
It made my feet hurt, walking
through all of that concrete.

59:46.321 --> 59:49.107
[laughs]

59:49.150 --> 59:51.631
I never, I never questioned
whether I'd made a bad decision.

59:51.675 --> 59:53.633
I never ever did,
which I'm very grateful for,

59:53.677 --> 59:55.635
that I never asked myself
those questions.

59:55.679 --> 59:58.507
But it was just like maybe it
would have been better

59:58.551 --> 1:00:01.336
had I just kept my mouth shut,
you know, and carried on.

1:00:01.380 --> 1:00:03.338
-Mm.
-You know, just in terms

1:00:03.382 --> 1:00:04.992

that whatever the biggest

1:06:25.590 --> 1:06:29.811
from your parents, that you
end up choosing relationships

from the past,
from you as a little girl

My dad's absolute lack
of presence and effort with me.

1:06:47.612 --> 1:06:49.440
But you know, as I got older,

1:06:49.483 --> 1:06:51.442
I definitely understood
that it was the alcohol.

1:06:51.485 --> 1:06:54.053
It wasn't a choice that he was
necessarily making in himself

1:06:54.097 --> 1:06:55.576
that he didn't want to
step up for me.

1:06:55.620 --> 1:06:57.535
But when you're little,
you don't know that.

1:06:57.578 --> 1:06:59.319
-Especially when he's like,
"I'm drinking juice."
-Yes.

1:06:59.363 --> 1:07:01.104
So I'm like,
"Well, I drink juice."

1:07:01.147 --> 1:07:02.931
Like, you know, you don't know
the sort of effects of it.

1:07:02.975 --> 1:07:04.890
But yeah, like,
when someone that you

1:07:04.933 --> 1:07:07.066
love so much, and the more
that you feel like

1:07:07.110 --> 1:07:09.590
they don't love you,
you love them even more...

1:07:09.634 --> 1:07:12.245
Like, I was definitely always
trying to fill that void.

1:07:12.289 --> 1:07:16.684
But at the same time, I would
expect it to hurt at some point.

1:07:16.728 --> 1:07:19.252
So I would hurt them first.

1:07:19.296 --> 1:07:21.602
You know,
not in a malicious way.

1:07:21.646 --> 1:07:23.517
It wasn't malicious,
it was just like I had

1:07:23.561 --> 1:07:25.258
absolutely zero expectations
of anybody.

1:07:25.302 --> 1:07:26.955
Because I never-- I learned not
to have them from my dad.

1:07:26.999 --> 1:07:29.088
Because you'd been let down
so many times.

1:07:29.132 --> 1:07:31.830
Yeah, so by having, you know,
zero expectations,

1:07:31.873 --> 1:07:34.093
I wouldn't
arrive for them either.

1:07:34.137 --> 1:07:36.356
Like, you know,
and I would feed off this energy

1:07:36.400 --> 1:07:39.446
so they'd be like,
well, why would I, like...

1:07:39.490 --> 1:07:42.319
like, make-- go beyond
and make that effort with you

1:07:42.362 --> 1:07:44.451
when A] you don't seem
to want me to;

1:07:44.495 --> 1:07:46.323
and B] you're not doing it.
Like, you know?

1:07:46.366 --> 1:07:49.413
Um, so it was definitely...
definitely that.

1:07:49.456 --> 1:07:51.241
And then during the-the,
you know,

1:07:51.284 --> 1:07:53.417
the sort of the last two,
three years of my life,

1:07:53.460 --> 1:07:55.419
my dad got really sick.

1:07:55.462 --> 1:07:59.640
And it was interesting
that that...

1:07:59.684 --> 1:08:02.382
happened during-- after,
just after having left

1:08:02.426 --> 1:08:04.776
my marriage when I had already
made the conscious decision

1:08:04.819 --> 1:08:07.953
to get to know myself
and figure some things out.

1:08:07.996 --> 1:08:11.913
And... not-not-not
that long ago,

1:08:11.957 --> 1:08:14.960
it was, um, back in April.

1:08:15.003 --> 1:08:16.483
When he-- when my dad died

1:08:16.527 --> 1:08:19.834
and we had our peace together,
I felt that...

1:08:19.878 --> 1:08:22.446
that huge gaping hole fill,
like, you know?

1:08:22.489 --> 1:08:24.970
-Really?
-Just, we-we-we forgave
each other.

1:08:25.013 --> 1:08:26.841
'Cause, you know,
I said hurtful things.

1:08:26.885 --> 1:08:28.930
I did-- I did nothing as bad
as what he did though,

1:08:28.974 --> 1:08:30.497
to be honest with you.
Like, you know, if you add it

1:08:30.541 --> 1:08:32.064
all up throughout my whole life.

1:08:32.108 --> 1:08:33.239
But I definitely, like,
snapped in the press

1:08:33.283 --> 1:08:35.023
and stuff like that at him,

1:08:35.067 --> 1:08:37.156
which definitely hurt
his feelings, of course.

1:08:37.200 --> 1:08:39.941
Um, but we
found our peace together.

1:08:39.985 --> 1:08:41.160
And then...

1:08:41.204 --> 1:08:42.640
You played the album for him.

1:08:42.683 --> 1:08:44.685
Played the album too,
on Zoom, yeah. Yeah.

1:08:44.729 --> 1:08:47.166
Was that healing
for both of you?

1:08:47.210 --> 1:08:48.689
-Yeah.
-What did you learn from that?

1:08:48.733 --> 1:08:51.388
When we met up
and when I heard he was ill,

1:08:51.431 --> 1:08:53.912
um, I went to go
and see him in Wales,

1:08:53.955 --> 1:08:56.262
and I wanted to play him
"To Be Loved."

1:08:56.306 --> 1:09:00.310
My main goal in life is
to be loved and love,

1:09:00.353 --> 1:09:02.050
you know, and so I wanted
to play it to my dad

1:09:02.094 --> 1:09:03.791
being like, "You're the reason
I haven't done that yet."

1:09:03.835 --> 1:09:05.445
'Cause he definitely was
the reason.

1:09:05.489 --> 1:09:07.534
He was the reason I haven't
fully accessed what it is

1:09:07.578 --> 1:09:10.972
to be, like, in a loving, loving
relationship with somebody.

1:09:11.016 --> 1:09:12.670
-Like, 360, like, you know.
-Mm-hmm.

1:09:12.713 --> 1:09:14.280
And he couldn't.

1:09:14.324 --> 1:09:15.977
He was like, "I've only ever
heard 'Hometown Glory.'"

1:09:16.021 --> 1:09:18.023
So I'm like, what? That's
the first song I ever wrote

1:09:18.066 --> 1:09:19.720
when I was, like, 16.

1:09:19.764 --> 1:09:22.549
And he was like, "It's
too painful," like, you know.

1:09:22.593 --> 1:09:24.812
-He's never heard anything other
than "Hometown..."
-He would never listen.

1:09:24.856 --> 1:09:26.336
He would switch it off
and he never ever

1:09:26.379 --> 1:09:28.207
played any of my other music,
he said.

1:09:28.251 --> 1:09:30.470
So I forced him to listen

1:09:30.514 --> 1:09:32.298
and it's like we both cried
and stuff like that,

1:09:32.342 --> 1:09:36.346
and then, um, so that--
him sort of really

1:09:36.389 --> 1:09:38.652
understanding my child wound
through my song

1:09:38.696 --> 1:09:40.437
was amazing for me.

1:09:40.480 --> 1:09:42.265
And again, I think he
could listen to me sing it

1:09:42.308 --> 1:09:44.789
but not say it. Yeah,
we're very similar like that.

1:09:44.832 --> 1:09:47.444
And then when I played him
the album,

1:09:47.487 --> 1:09:50.577
it was just, by then
he'd listened to all of 19,

1:09:50.621 --> 1:09:52.840
all of 21,all of 25,
and my mum was helping to look

1:09:52.884 --> 1:09:54.886
after him
towards the end as well.

1:09:54.929 --> 1:09:58.890
And his favorites were
all of my favorites,

1:09:58.933 --> 1:10:01.458
you know, which I thought
was amazing and...

1:10:01.501 --> 1:10:04.852
he wished that he'd done
what I had been doing.

1:10:04.896 --> 1:10:07.072
For myself, you know?
Like, the journey.

1:10:07.115 --> 1:10:09.030
-Working on himself. Yeah.
The journey.
-Yeah. He wished he'd done it.

1:10:09.074 --> 1:10:12.120
-Yeah.
-Yeah. And he was proud of me
for doing it, so it was,

1:10:12.164 --> 1:10:15.036
it was very, very healing.
But when he died,

1:10:15.080 --> 1:10:17.256
it was just, it was,
it literally, it was...

1:10:17.300 --> 1:10:18.953
it was like the wound closed up.

1:10:18.997 --> 1:10:21.217
And I've been so open, you know.

1:10:21.260 --> 1:10:22.740
Didn't your therapist
at one point

1:10:22.783 --> 1:10:25.264
say you need to sit with
a seven-year-old Adele?

1:10:25.308 --> 1:10:27.135
-Yeah.
-And when you did that, sat with

1:10:27.179 --> 1:10:28.267
the seven-year-old Adele...

1:10:28.311 --> 1:10:30.269
-Yeah.
-What did you find?

1:10:30.313 --> 1:10:32.706
Um...

1:10:33.838 --> 1:10:35.970
A very sad little girl.

1:10:36.014 --> 1:10:37.450
Mm.

1:10:37.494 --> 1:10:40.279
No! You're trying
to make me cry.

1:10:40.323 --> 1:10:41.411
No, I'm not. No, I'm not.

1:10:41.454 --> 1:10:42.673
No, yeah, it was.
It was.

1:10:42.716 --> 1:10:45.719
She was sad but also,
you know,

1:10:45.763 --> 1:10:48.461
she was willing, willing.

1:10:48.505 --> 1:10:51.899
-Willing to get out and run.
-Look at what she did.

1:10:51.943 --> 1:10:53.684
-Look at what she did.
-I said I wouldn't
stay in there.

1:10:53.727 --> 1:10:55.033
-Yeah.
-I said that when I was little.

1:10:55.076 --> 1:10:56.730
-Look at what she did.
-I was like,

1:10:56.774 --> 1:10:59.037
"I'm not staying here. This is
not what-- this life is--

1:10:59.080 --> 1:11:00.821
"I'm in the wrong place.
I've been sent-- I've been,

1:11:00.865 --> 1:11:02.345
you know,
sent to the wrong place."

1:11:02.388 --> 1:11:05.043
I said I wasn't staying there
and I-I left.

1:11:05.086 --> 1:11:07.828
Yeah, that's the thing is
to look back on who you were

1:11:07.872 --> 1:11:11.745
and what you've come through
and all of that is what

1:11:11.789 --> 1:11:13.747
-allowed this to be sitting
in this chair right now.
-Yeah!

1:11:13.791 --> 1:11:15.488
And then you learn to appreciate
all the things that you did

1:11:15.532 --> 1:11:17.185
-have to go through.
-Yeah.

1:11:17.229 --> 1:11:18.752
'Cause it's a part of it.
You might not have gotten to

1:11:18.796 --> 1:11:20.972
where you are, you know.
And I'm sure I've got many

1:11:21.015 --> 1:11:22.495
more mountains to climb,

1:11:22.539 --> 1:11:24.323
that will come my way,
and I'm sure I'll have

1:11:24.367 --> 1:11:27.021
another little, like, you know,
like swerve, you know,

1:11:27.065 --> 1:11:28.327
swerve out of the way
for something

1:11:28.371 --> 1:11:29.981
and stuff like that, but...

1:11:30.024 --> 1:11:31.852
I feel like I'll get better
at it every time

you start dating again?

1:15:50.023 --> 1:15:51.721
I mean, you can't go on
a dating app. Do you, like...

1:15:51.764 --> 1:15:54.419
-No.
-...take advice from friends
or somebody says,

1:15:54.462 --> 1:15:56.073
"Oh, I know somebody"?

1:15:56.116 --> 1:15:57.901
Like, how did you meet
Rich Paul?

1:15:57.944 --> 1:16:00.686
I met him at a birthday party.
We were on the dance floor.

1:16:00.730 --> 1:16:03.297
And I met him and then a
couple of-- couple years later,

1:16:03.341 --> 1:16:05.561
we went out for dinner, which
he says was a business meeting.

1:16:05.604 --> 1:16:07.606
I'm like,
a business meeting about what?

1:16:07.650 --> 1:16:09.608
We wouldn't be having a meeting
about business.

1:16:09.652 --> 1:16:11.610
And then it was just
the first time

1:16:11.654 --> 1:16:13.177
we'd hung out only on our own,

1:16:13.220 --> 1:16:14.613
and not with other friends
and stuff like that.

1:16:14.657 --> 1:16:16.354
So that was a very natural way.

1:16:16.397 --> 1:16:17.703
I think that's how people
would normally meet each other

1:16:17.747 --> 1:16:19.444
-is, like, in real life.
-Mm-hmm.

1:16:19.487 --> 1:16:22.621
Mm-hmm. What was it about him
that drew you to him?

1:16:22.665 --> 1:16:25.015
I mean, we all know
he's the super agent.

1:16:25.058 --> 1:16:26.843
-And he's...
-Yeah, he's just hilarious.

1:16:26.886 --> 1:16:28.888
-He's also hilarious?
-Oh, he's so funny.

1:16:28.932 --> 1:16:30.107
-Okay.
-No, he's hilarious.

1:16:30.150 --> 1:16:32.675
-Yeah, and very smart.
-Okay.

1:16:32.718 --> 1:16:34.590
You know, he's very, very smart.

1:16:34.633 --> 1:16:36.548
It's quite... quite incredible
watching him do what he does.

1:16:36.592 --> 1:16:39.725
And just the easiness of it.
It's just, it's...

1:16:39.769 --> 1:16:42.293
-been very smooth.
-He's making it easy on you.

1:16:42.336 --> 1:16:43.642
He's making it easy on me.
I'm blushing.

1:16:43.686 --> 1:16:45.818

1:16:45.862 --> 1:16:51.345
Okay, so this relationship
with super agent Rich Paul...

1:16:51.389 --> 1:16:53.652
I can't say his name without
saying "super agent" Rich Paul.

1:16:53.696 --> 1:16:56.612
This relationship is the
first time you've actually...

1:16:56.655 --> 1:16:59.092
Loved myself
and been open to loving

1:16:59.136 --> 1:17:00.790
and being loved
by someone else. Yeah.

1:17:00.833 --> 1:17:02.313
So Rich is getting
a different Adele

1:17:02.356 --> 1:17:04.402
than everybody else has gotten.

1:17:04.445 --> 1:17:08.493
Y-Yeah, but I mean,
by arriving and turning up.

1:17:08.536 --> 1:17:10.756
-Yeah.
-You know, maybe I'm
getting a different version

1:17:10.800 --> 1:17:12.671
of him and who knows?
It's just, it's just timing.

1:17:12.715 --> 1:17:16.675
-Mm-hmm.
-It's just timing,
but it'll be interesting to see

1:17:16.719 --> 1:17:19.983
what my reaction is like
in general to anything that

1:17:20.026 --> 1:17:22.376
hurts me now that I feel
so secure in myself.

1:17:22.420 --> 1:17:23.856
-Yeah.
-And I'm talking outside
of romance as well.

1:17:23.900 --> 1:17:25.423
Like, I'm just talking about
any scenario.

1:17:25.466 --> 1:17:27.033
-Yeah.
-It'll be interesting to see

1:17:27.077 --> 1:17:28.382
how close I let it come to me.

1:17:28.426 --> 1:17:29.775
So...

1:17:30.820 --> 1:17:33.605
Do you think you'll be able to
write from a happy space?

1:17:33.649 --> 1:17:35.694
Well, I hope so.

1:17:35.738 --> 1:17:37.696
-I hope so, you know.
-Mm-hmm.

1:17:37.740 --> 1:17:39.002
But the music will change?

1:17:39.045 --> 1:17:41.134
Like...

1:17:41.178 --> 1:17:43.920
Like, "Love Is," like, you know,
the last song on the album?

1:17:43.963 --> 1:17:46.009
-"Love is a Game."
-Yeah, it's about love.

1:17:46.052 --> 1:17:48.141
Here's some of the lyrics.

1:17:48.185 --> 1:17:50.143
"Love is a game
for fools to play

1:17:50.187 --> 1:17:52.537
"and I ain't fooling.
What a cruel thing

1:17:52.580 --> 1:17:54.757
to self-inflict that pain."

1:17:54.800 --> 1:17:57.368
And I wanted to know,
are you, Adele,

1:17:57.411 --> 1:18:02.590
getting better at this game
of love?

1:18:02.634 --> 1:18:04.897
Yeah, I think so because
I don't, I don't, um,

1:18:04.941 --> 1:18:06.682
I don't treat it
like a game anymore.

1:18:06.725 --> 1:18:08.379
You know, that thing of like,
you're gonna hurt me

1:18:08.422 --> 1:18:09.423
so I'm gonna hurt you first.
I certainly,

1:18:09.467 --> 1:18:11.077
I'm not like that anymore.

1:18:11.121 --> 1:18:13.253
You know, one of the things
I think is so valuable

1:18:13.297 --> 1:18:15.734
in knowing how to move forward
in your life

1:18:15.778 --> 1:18:19.477
is having clarity on what
it is you really want.

1:18:19.520 --> 1:18:20.870
Mm-hmm.

1:18:20.913 --> 1:18:22.480
-And when you...
-And what you like.

1:18:22.523 --> 1:18:24.003
Yes, and what you like,
but mostly

1:18:24.047 --> 1:18:26.832
knowing in the spirit and soul
of yourself

1:18:26.876 --> 1:18:28.181
what is it you really want

1:18:28.225 --> 1:18:29.835
because that's how
you start to--

1:18:29.879 --> 1:18:31.707
-drawing that to yourself.
-Yeah.

1:18:31.750 --> 1:18:34.057
And do you know what that is,
ultimately?

1:18:34.100 --> 1:18:37.103
What do you really want?

1:18:37.147 --> 1:18:38.975
-Peace of mind.
-Just peace of mind?

1:18:39.018 --> 1:18:40.193
-Just peace of mind.
-Okay.

1:18:40.237 --> 1:18:42.761
Um, and stability, but I can--

1:18:42.805 --> 1:18:45.155
I don't have to expect someone
else to give me stability.

1:18:45.198 --> 1:18:47.679
I can also be stable for myself.

1:18:47.723 --> 1:18:50.116
Be a solid house that doesn't
blow over in a storm.

1:18:50.160 --> 1:18:52.771
Mm-hmm. Well, the best thing you
said here in this interview,

1:18:52.815 --> 1:18:54.555
as far as I'm concerned, is that

1:18:54.599 --> 1:18:58.255
now you're in a relationship
where, for the first time,

1:18:58.298 --> 1:19:00.866
-your love for yourself
comes first.
-Yeah.

1:19:00.910 --> 1:19:03.564
And all great things come
after that. I know that.

1:19:03.608 --> 1:19:05.915
A quote I heard as well
while on my journey was:

1:19:05.958 --> 1:19:07.220
"If you're not feeling
everything,

1:19:07.264 --> 1:19:08.265
you're missing everything."

1:19:08.308 --> 1:19:10.615
That sort of gave me permission.

1:19:10.658 --> 1:19:12.182
Mm-hmm.

1:19:12.225 --> 1:19:13.661
To really do that
during the process.

1:19:13.705 --> 1:19:15.489
-Yeah. Yeah.
-You know? And not be upset.

1:19:15.533 --> 1:19:18.188
This has been great. Thanks
for coming to the rose garden.

1:19:18.231 --> 1:19:19.711
I can't believe we just
had a chat.

1:19:19.755 --> 1:19:21.191
-It's wild.
-We had a little chat.

1:19:21.234 --> 1:19:23.106
Thanks for letting me come
to the concert.

1:19:23.149 --> 1:19:24.890
Oh, my gosh, I'm so excited.

1:19:24.934 --> 1:19:26.587
-It's gonna be so great.
-I hope you like it. Yeah.

1:19:26.631 --> 1:19:28.938
And I wish you all the things
your heart desires.

1:19:28.981 --> 1:19:31.070

-That's my prayer for you.

1:19:31.114 --> 1:19:33.638
-Thank you.
-All the things
your heart desires.

1:19:33.681 --> 1:19:35.553

from a happy space.
