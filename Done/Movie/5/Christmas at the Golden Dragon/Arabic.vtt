00:02.066 --> 00:02.500
تم تصنيف هذا البرنامج G

00:04.233 --> 00:07.300
ومناسب للجمهور
العام.

00:19.734 --> 00:20.800
بمجرد أن ننتهي من الحشو

00:20.934 --> 00:23.333
بطوننا مليئة بالديك
الرومي والحشوة ،

00:23.467 --> 00:26.600
نحن بالفعل نستعد عقليا
للجاذبية الرئيسية.

00:26.734 --> 00:29.867
نصنع قوائم الرغبات ،
وابدأ في التخطيط
لحفلة العطلة المثالية ،

00:30.000 --> 00:31.867
الغوص في أكوام من
النعناع

00:32.000 --> 00:35.133
ومضايقة أطفالنا حول كونهم
في قائمة المشاغبين أو اللطفاء.

00:35.266 --> 00:37.600
من الصعب تذكر
عيد الميلاد هذا

00:37.734 --> 00:40.133
لا يتعلق بتعقب
أفضل أداة في الموسم ،

00:40.266 --> 00:42.734
أو أحدهم يرفع
زينة جيراننا.

00:42.867 --> 00:47.567
يتعلق الأمر بتكريم جذورنا
والاستمتاع بالحاضر.

00:47.700 --> 00:51.000
كلنا نقضي الكثير من
الوقت في التسرع

00:51.133 --> 00:54.133
إلى الاجتماعات والمواعيد
والمواعيد ،

00:54.266 --> 00:56.700
ومن أجل منشورات انستغرام.

00:56.834 --> 01:01.834
عيد الميلاد هو
السلام وليس الإنتاجية.

01:03.033 --> 01:04.200
يجب أن يكون
الوقت الوحيد من العام

01:04.333 --> 01:07.700
عندما يُسمح لنا بذلك.

01:09.800 --> 01:11.734
وهنا حيث
مفروشات هارلو

01:11.867 --> 01:14.266
يأتي خط إكسسوارات العطلة الجديد .

01:14.400 --> 01:16.133
سنفعل كل العمل من أجلك.

01:16.266 --> 01:20.000
أنت فقط ، لأنه في النهاية ،

01:20.133 --> 01:23.867
الأسرة هي دائمًا
أفضل ديكور لديك.

01:24.000 --> 01:24.867
لقد فعلتها.

01:25.000 --> 01:27.266
الأسرة هي دائمًا
أفضل ديكور لديك.

01:27.400 --> 01:29.033
في مدينة مثل نيويورك.

01:29.166 --> 01:30.266
شجرة روكفلر

01:30.400 --> 01:33.133
تعرض نافذة المتجر الاحتفالي .

01:33.266 --> 01:35.066
أعني قاعة موسيقى راديو سيتي؟

01:35.200 --> 01:37.400
تنفجر المدينة
بهتافات عيد الميلاد.

01:37.533 --> 01:39.767
بالتأكيد ، المدينة تحتفل
بعيد الميلاد بأناقة ،

01:39.900 --> 01:42.400
وأنا متأكد من أنك حظيت أيضًا ببعض
أعياد الميلاد الرائعة أثناء نشأتك.

01:42.533 --> 01:45.133
حسنًا ، عندما لم يكن لديك
عيد ميلاد حقيقي من قبل ،

01:45.266 --> 01:47.200
لديك الكثير من
الوقت بينهما

01:47.333 --> 01:48.800
لملء الفراغات
(ضحكات مكتومة).

01:48.934 --> 01:51.734
عائلتك
لا تفعل عيد الميلاد؟

01:51.867 --> 01:54.133
حسنًا ، عائلتي تمتلك
مطعمًا صينيًا في ويتشيتا.

01:54.266 --> 01:56.300
إنه أحد
المطاعم الوحيدة المفتوحة لعيد الميلاد.

01:56.433 --> 01:59.033
لذا ، فإن العطلات هي أكثر
أوقات السنة ازدحامًا.

02:18.533 --> 02:20.834
الآن ، من
الآن وحتى عيد الميلاد ،

02:20.967 --> 02:22.800
لقد صنعنا الآلاف
من هذا (ضحكات خافتة).

02:22.934 --> 02:25.200
بحلول العام المقبل ، سأكون قد
اكتملت الوصفة (يضحك).

02:25.333 --> 02:28.266
يا.

02:28.400 --> 02:32.400
- شكرًا لك.
- على الرحب والسعة.

02:32.533 --> 02:35.000
شخص ما يتوق إلى
أيام الهندسة المعمارية الخاصة بها.

02:35.133 --> 02:37.100
ربما التصميم ،

02:37.233 --> 02:39.967
لكن المواعيد النهائية
والعملاء العصابيون ، أبدًا.

02:40.100 --> 02:41.200
أوه (ضحكات مكتومة).

02:41.333 --> 02:42.300
أوه ، جين.

02:43.834 --> 02:45.700
مم.

02:45.834 --> 02:47.834
أنا ممتن
لك مو شو الخاص بك.

02:47.967 --> 02:49.367
إنه أمر محبط للطبخ.

02:49.500 --> 02:51.066
أوه.

02:51.200 --> 02:53.867
لا أصدق أن جيري
قد رحل ستة أشهر.

02:54.000 --> 02:56.266
كما تعلم ، مدرب كرة السلة الجديد في جامعة ويتشيتا

02:56.400 --> 02:58.300
هو فقط ، ليس
لديه نفس الطاقة.

02:59.400 --> 03:01.166
كيف
تصمد ابنتك؟

03:01.300 --> 03:03.100
لم أرها
هنا مؤخرًا.

03:04.133 --> 03:04.166
يبدو الأمر وكأن شيئًا لم يحدث.

03:08.333 --> 03:11.900
مجرد قضاء كل
ساعة استيقاظ في العمل.

03:12.033 --> 03:14.467
حسنًا ، لقد حصلت على
وظيفة المدير المالي الفاخرة.

03:14.600 --> 03:16.066
الكثير من المسؤولية.

03:16.200 --> 03:17.033
هذا ما تفعله.

03:19.400 --> 03:21.200
أوه ، أعتقد أنه من الأفضل أن أذهب.

03:21.333 --> 03:22.433
الكثير من المهمات لتشغيلها.

03:23.667 --> 03:26.200
قبل أيام قليلة فقط ...

03:26.333 --> 03:28.300
قبل حفل عطلتي السنوية.

03:29.333 --> 03:31.900
أراك
لاحقًا يا جين.

03:38.066 --> 03:39.333
اعلم اعلم.

03:39.467 --> 03:41.200
أعلم أنه ليس خطأك
أن جميع الرحلات الجوية

03:41.333 --> 03:42.900
من هاواي قد تأخر.

03:43.033 --> 03:45.867
أعرف ما
يعنيه التحذير من البركان النشط.

03:46.000 --> 03:46.867
أجل عزيزتي؟

03:47.000 --> 03:48.800
أعرف ما
يعنيه التحذير من البركان النشط.

03:48.934 --> 03:50.266
ماذا علي
أن أفعل لعيد الميلاد؟

03:50.400 --> 03:51.300
هل الطعام جاهز؟

03:51.433 --> 03:52.934
أنا جائع.

03:53.066 --> 03:53.934
عزيزتي ، أعلم.

03:54.066 --> 03:55.333
فقط أعطني ثانية واحدة من فضلك.

03:55.467 --> 03:57.867
الفتيات ، هل
تريد أن تراني تخمين

03:58.000 --> 03:59.266
ماذا تقول كعكة الحظ؟

03:59.400 --> 04:00.400
- نعم!
- نعم؟

04:00.533 --> 04:01.533
حسنًا ، ها هم.

04:01.667 --> 04:03.867
أي واحد علينا أن نفعل؟

04:04.000 --> 04:05.934
أوه ، هذا صعب.

04:06.066 --> 04:06.934
أستطيع أن أفعل ذلك.

04:07.066 --> 04:11.000
حسنًا (الشخير) ، فهمت.

04:11.133 --> 04:14.066
كعكة الحظ هذه تقول
إنها مفاجأة سارة

04:14.200 --> 04:15.600
قادم في طريقك.

04:15.734 --> 04:17.900
هل نرى؟ حسنا؟

04:19.000 --> 04:19.066
حسنًا ، قرأته
وأخبرني.

04:25.667 --> 04:30.033
تقول ، "
مفاجأة سارة في طريقك."

04:30.967 --> 04:32.333
يحفز.

04:37.734 --> 04:39.600
- مرحبًا ، نيت.
- أوه.

04:39.734 --> 04:41.266
صلصة البط الإضافية لفيفيان ،

04:41.400 --> 04:43.133
لا الفول السوداني للكونغ باو ،

04:43.266 --> 04:46.500
وأنا أعلم حساسية جيسي.

04:46.633 --> 04:50.233
إنه لأمر محزن كيف تعرفنا جيدًا
، لكن بشكل غريب.

04:50.367 --> 04:52.066
إذاً ، أنت
والفتيات فقط؟

04:52.200 --> 04:53.200
نعم.

04:53.333 --> 04:54.467
وما زلت أحاول
معرفة ذلك

04:54.600 --> 04:55.867
كيف تعد وجبة غداء جيدة

04:56.000 --> 04:58.133
أثناء سحب
جديلة فرنسية متوسطة.

04:59.667 --> 05:01.900
أنا آسف نيت (يضحك).

05:02.033 --> 05:03.567
كل شيء جيد.

05:03.700 --> 05:05.400
لقد وعدت الفتيات
بأفضل عطلة على الإطلاق ،

05:05.533 --> 05:07.567
وهذا بالضبط ما
سأقدمه لهم.

05:07.700 --> 05:09.300
مرح بلا توقف ، مرح ، مرح.

05:10.533 --> 05:12.433
تمنى لي الحظ.

05:12.567 --> 05:14.600
العمل بجهد
وليس حتى وقت العشاء.

05:14.734 --> 05:18.000
أكثر انشغالنا على الإطلاق ،
وهذا يقول الكثير.

05:18.133 --> 05:18.900
ها أنت ذا.

05:19.033 --> 05:19.667
أوه.

05:23.800 --> 05:25.266
برينستون؟

05:25.400 --> 05:26.533
وهي سميكة.

05:26.667 --> 05:27.700
أنت تعرف ماذا يعني ذلك؟

05:29.400 --> 05:31.600
هذه رابع
خطاب قبول مبكر تحصل عليه ،

05:31.734 --> 05:34.000
كل ذلك من كليات مذهلة.

05:34.133 --> 05:35.400
لا يمكنني الذهاب على أي حال ،
فما هي الفائدة؟

05:35.533 --> 05:36.533
أوه ، ميغيل.

05:36.667 --> 05:38.200
ستفزع الملوثات العضوية الثابتة الخاصة بي
إذا اكتشف ذلك

05:38.333 --> 05:41.200
تم قبولي في
كل هذه المدارس الفاخرة.

05:41.333 --> 05:44.000
ربما حاول أن تفعل شيئًا
مجنونًا للحصول على المال.

05:44.133 --> 05:46.600
هل تقدمت إلى تلك
المنحة التي أخبرتني جين عنها؟

05:46.734 --> 05:49.200
حصلت على مقابلتي غدا.

05:49.333 --> 05:50.667
أوه ، ميغيل ، هذا رائع.

05:57.333 --> 05:59.166
اعتقدت أن طبيبك
قال لك لم يكن من المفترض

05:59.300 --> 06:02.133
أن تأكل أي شيء
حار أو مالح أو مقلي؟

06:02.266 --> 06:05.734
لقد أصبت بسكتة دماغية ، وليس
إزالة برعم التذوق.

06:05.867 --> 06:07.467
الى جانب ذلك ، أنا بخير.

06:09.200 --> 06:10.600
كيف تسللت خارج
منزلك على أي حال؟

06:10.734 --> 06:13.400
معالجي يعتقد
أنني في الحمام.

06:13.533 --> 06:14.667
فقط أعطني الأرز المقلي بلحم الخنزير.

06:14.800 --> 06:17.600
شكرا سيد باربر.

06:20.133 --> 06:21.667
شكرًا لك.

06:21.800 --> 06:22.967
يا.

06:23.100 --> 06:23.734
شكرًا.

06:23.867 --> 06:25.467
أنت منقذ.

06:25.600 --> 06:27.200
اوه شكرا لك.

06:27.333 --> 06:28.667
أخيرًا ، أنت
آخر توصيل لي ،

06:28.800 --> 06:30.500
لذلك آمل أن أكون
قادرًا على الشعور بأصابعي

06:30.633 --> 06:31.367
قبل ان أخلد إلى النوم.

06:31.500 --> 06:32.333
أوه (ضحكات مكتومة).

06:32.467 --> 06:33.700
- أرك لاحقًا.
- وداعا.

06:39.467 --> 06:41.333
الجرعة اليومية من لو مين.

06:41.467 --> 06:42.633
يا الحمد لله.

06:42.767 --> 06:44.100
لقد تخطيت وجبة الإفطار هذا الصباح

06:44.233 --> 06:46.200
للبدء مبكرا
ولدي وقت متأخر من الليل.

06:46.333 --> 06:48.066
هل لم يكن لديك
وقت متأخر من الليل؟

06:48.200 --> 06:50.100
التكنولوجيا هي عمل 24/7.

06:50.233 --> 06:53.333
الابتكار لا يتوقف فقط
لأنه أواخر ديسمبر ،

06:53.467 --> 06:55.600
لكن فقط لأنني
أحرق زيت منتصف الليل

06:55.734 --> 06:58.000
لا يعني أن
كل شخص يجب أن يكون كذلك.

06:58.133 --> 06:59.266
عد إلى المنزل مبكرًا ، بيث.

06:59.400 --> 07:00.600
ستبدأ إجازتك غدًا.

07:00.734 --> 07:02.333
العطل مع
ثلاثة صغار؟

07:02.467 --> 07:04.133
بالكاد سأسمي ذلك إجازة.

07:04.266 --> 07:07.533
أنت محظوظ جدًا لأنك حصلت
على عيد ميلاد لطيف وبسيط.

07:07.667 --> 07:08.700
لي حظ.

07:08.834 --> 07:09.734
عيد ميلاد مجيد يا بيث.

07:09.867 --> 07:10.600
أنت أيضاً.

07:23.433 --> 07:25.200
تمام.

07:25.333 --> 07:26.433
لقد كتبت مثل عشرات الأوامر

07:26.567 --> 07:28.367
وهم في جميع
أنحاء المدينة ، لذلك ...

07:30.734 --> 07:32.266
من أين لك هذا؟

07:32.400 --> 07:33.734
كانت مخبأة في
الزاوية المظلمة العميقة

07:33.867 --> 07:35.333
من غرفة التجميد.

07:35.467 --> 07:36.800
أوه.

07:36.934 --> 07:38.467
كيف وجدت ذلك؟

07:38.600 --> 07:41.300
رأيتك تطبخها
وتخبئها هناك.

07:41.433 --> 07:43.033
كنت فقط العبث.

07:43.166 --> 07:44.734
والدي هو الشيف.

07:44.867 --> 07:46.100
تعال يا صاح.

07:46.233 --> 07:48.367
والدي هو الشيف.

07:49.333 --> 07:49.367
ما هذا؟ شيء مذهل.

07:55.300 --> 07:56.333
انه لذيذ.

07:56.467 --> 07:57.734
ليس مثل ما يهم.

07:57.867 --> 08:00.467
والدي لا يعرف حتى
أنني أريد أن أصبح طاهياً.

08:00.600 --> 08:02.400
أعني ، قد أكون مخطئا ،

08:02.533 --> 08:04.600
لكن أعتقد أن هناك
مطاعم أخرى.

08:12.900 --> 08:15.600
دعونا نرى أي
عميل مزعج قاطع
استراحة الوحيدة.

08:15.734 --> 08:18.133
سيكون هذا العميل المزعج أنا.

08:18.266 --> 08:19.367
سادي!

08:19.500 --> 08:20.367
أهلاً.

08:20.500 --> 08:21.867
ريك ، مهلا.

08:22.900 --> 08:25.200
لقد مر وقت طويل.

08:25.333 --> 08:26.367
نعم ، لقد فعلته.

08:28.533 --> 08:29.266
هل هذا لي (ضحكة مكتومة)؟

08:29.400 --> 08:31.100
أوه نعم.

08:31.233 --> 08:32.667
هنا تذهب (ضحكة مكتومة).

08:32.800 --> 08:35.200
لا عشاء هانوكا كبير الليلة؟

08:35.333 --> 08:36.734
أبي يحرق دائما اللاتكس

08:36.867 --> 08:39.467
ولحم الصدر جاف جدًا
ويمكننا استخدامه كإشعال ،

08:39.600 --> 08:41.867
لذلك فهذه تعزيزات.

08:42.000 --> 08:44.133
تمامًا مثل الأيام الخوالي ، أليس كذلك؟

08:44.266 --> 08:45.633
أتذكر عندما كنت
تعمل هنا ،

08:45.767 --> 08:47.734
سيكون هناك الكثير من بقايا الطعام
تذهب إلى منزل كوهين.

08:47.867 --> 08:50.100
هذا المكان بالتأكيد
أنقذ شهيتي

08:50.233 --> 08:51.633
وعقلي أكثر من مرة.

08:52.767 --> 08:54.266
هل ما زلت في جامعة كاليفورنيا؟

08:54.400 --> 08:55.233
سنة التخرج.

08:56.000 --> 08:56.734
وماذا عنك؟

08:56.867 --> 08:58.233
متي عدت؟

08:58.367 --> 09:00.467
أوه لا ، أنا فقط
أقشعر لها الأبدان هنا في ويتشيتا.

09:00.600 --> 09:02.433
البقاء مع أهلي.

09:02.567 --> 09:05.533
لم نر
بعضنا البعض بشكل شخصي منذ-

09:05.667 --> 09:07.433
لقد تخلت عني
قبل الحفلة الراقصة.

09:08.400 --> 09:11.333
أوه ، أنا آسف جدا ، سادي.

09:11.467 --> 09:12.567
كنت بالفعل في الكلية.

09:12.700 --> 09:15.867
أخبرني إخواني أن
الأمر مثير للشفقة

09:16.000 --> 09:17.934
أن أرقص ببطء في
صالة الألعاب الرياضية في مدرستي الثانوية (ضحكات مكتومة).

09:18.066 --> 09:19.834
يمكن أن أشارك هذا
معي قبل أن أشتري

09:19.967 --> 09:21.934
فستان لم أستطع إعادته

09:22.066 --> 09:24.967
لأنها كانت ملطخة بالدموع
وبصمات أصابع شيتو.

09:26.400 --> 09:27.567
اعتقدت أنك سألتني فقط

09:27.700 --> 09:30.600
لأنك أردت
أن تكون رقصتك الأولى باردة.

09:30.734 --> 09:32.633
اذهب مع صديق ، بدون ضغط.

09:33.934 --> 09:35.934
ليس تماما.

09:36.066 --> 09:42.433
مهلا ، هل يمكننا اللحاق
ربما الليلة أو غدا؟

09:42.567 --> 09:44.667
أنا مشغول جدًا
بأشياء العائلة قبل أن أعود.

09:44.800 --> 09:47.333
عليك أن تدعني أعوض
عن كونك أحمق.

09:47.467 --> 09:48.567
يمكننا إعادة تقديمك

09:48.700 --> 09:51.934
إلى خدع
عطلة الغرب الأوسط القديمة الجيدة.

09:52.066 --> 09:53.467
لا يبدو ذلك مغريًا.

09:59.867 --> 10:01.934
أنا أحب
الأجواء الرومانسية ، لكنك فعلت الكثير.

10:02.066 --> 10:04.533
لا أريد أن أشعل
كاشف الدخان الخاص بك.

10:04.667 --> 10:06.734
إنها ليلتنا الأخيرة
معًا قبل العطلة.

10:06.867 --> 10:09.800
أردت أن أفعل
شيئًا مميزًا.

10:09.934 --> 10:11.600
أنت تعرف ، تذوق
لها هذه القطعة الأخيرة

10:11.734 --> 10:14.600
من الهتاف قبل
عبودية صلصة الصويا (ضحكة مكتومة).

10:14.734 --> 10:19.700
حسنًا ، قد يكون هذا جنونًا ،
لكن تعال معي إلى فيرمونت.

10:21.433 --> 10:23.300
تريدني أن أقضي
عيد الميلاد مع عائلتك؟

10:23.433 --> 10:26.266
أعلم أنها خطوة كبيرة
وهي اللحظة الأخيرة تمامًا ،

10:26.400 --> 10:27.700
لكنني استأجرت سيارة بالفعل

10:27.834 --> 10:30.767
وعائلتي كانت ترغب
في مقابلتك منذ زمن طويل.

10:32.066 --> 10:35.467
هذا يبدو مذهلاً للغاية.

10:35.600 --> 10:37.567
إنه فقط
الأسبوع الأكثر ازدحامًا

10:37.700 --> 10:38.934
العام للمطعم ،

10:39.066 --> 10:42.300
وسيقتلني والداي
بسبب الكفالة.

10:42.433 --> 10:43.867
بالإضافة إلى أنني سأشعر
بالفزع حيال وجود

10:44.000 --> 10:46.567
الكثير من المرح بينما كانوا
في أعماق الركبة في الزلابية.

10:46.700 --> 10:47.500
أحصل عليه.

10:48.867 --> 10:56.400
ربما العام المقبل ، حسنًا؟

10:56.533 --> 11:00.333
هل تتذكر العام الذي
أراد فيه رومي منزل أحلام باربي؟

11:00.467 --> 11:02.834
تلك ذات السيارة
القابلة للتحويل الوردي (ضحكة مكتومة).

11:04.000 --> 11:06.633
لم نصل إلى
المركز التجاري حتى العام الجديد

11:06.767 --> 11:07.667
وتم بيعها كلها.

11:07.800 --> 11:09.533
بكت طوال اليوم.

11:09.667 --> 11:10.667
نعم.

11:11.734 --> 11:13.000
انظر ، هذا من السيدة ويلسون.

11:13.133 --> 11:13.967
أوه.

11:14.100 --> 11:16.767
انظر ، هذا من السيدة ويلسون.

11:18.000 --> 11:19.934
جميع عملائنا الكرام.

11:20.066 --> 11:21.533
لا أصدق
مقدار ما أضافوه

11:21.667 --> 11:22.934
لهذه الشجرة على مر السنين.

11:23.066 --> 11:24.867
نعم ، حتى لو لم يكن لدينا
شجرة في المنزل ،

11:25.000 --> 11:26.600
نحن دائما نحصل على هذا.

11:31.667 --> 11:34.233
أتمنى أن تكون هناك طريقة
لتعويض الأطفال.

11:34.367 --> 11:36.467
دعهم يحظون
بعيد الميلاد المناسب.

11:36.600 --> 11:38.000
استمتع بالموسم
دون تفكير

11:38.133 --> 11:41.934
حول طاولات الحافلات
أو تفريغ الإمدادات.

11:45.600 --> 11:46.400
آه.

11:46.533 --> 11:47.533
إنها رومي.

11:47.667 --> 11:50.867
أوه ، الصنبور الجديد هنا.

11:51.000 --> 11:51.900
هلا حبيبتي.

11:52.033 --> 11:53.533
كيف حالك؟

11:53.667 --> 11:55.867
سحقت عرضي التقديمي
واحتفلت مع بليك.

11:56.000 --> 11:57.100
آه!

11:57.233 --> 12:00.333
سحقت عرضي التقديمي
واحتفلت مع بليك.

12:00.467 --> 12:01.800
طلب مني الانضمام.

12:01.934 --> 12:03.900
أوه ، هذه
خطوة كبيرة (ضحكات خافتة).

12:05.467 --> 12:07.800
كان سيكون ساحرًا للغاية ،
ليس فقط لمقابلة عائلته ،

12:07.934 --> 12:10.867
ولكن لتجربة
عيد الميلاد الحقيقي.

12:13.600 --> 12:15.100
ربما يجب أن تذهب ، عزيزي.

12:16.834 --> 12:19.066
أعتقد أن واي فاي الخاص بي خلل

12:19.200 --> 12:23.433
لأنني اعتقدت أنني سمعتك
تقول أنني يجب أن أذهب مع بليك.

12:23.567 --> 12:24.700
لدينا التنين مغطى ،

12:24.834 --> 12:27.333
لذا استمتع
بعيد الميلاد الرائع مع بليك.

12:27.467 --> 12:28.066
آه (الصئيل)!

12:30.867 --> 12:31.600
هل حقا؟

12:46.467 --> 12:47.867
مرحبًا ، دكتور كوهين.

12:49.934 --> 12:52.066
أسعد
العطل لك أيضا.

12:52.200 --> 12:54.033
لقد افتقدناك في
حفل الكوكتيل الخاص بنا.

12:55.867 --> 12:57.867
حسنا كيف نفعل؟

12:58.000 --> 12:59.667
لسوء الحظ ،
أيا من الأجنة

12:59.800 --> 13:01.033
جعلها من خلال الانفجار.

13:02.633 --> 13:02.667
لكن كان لدينا أربعة
منهم هذه المرة.

13:06.066 --> 13:08.700
الأرقام فقط
لم تكن في صالحنا.

13:08.834 --> 13:11.867
أنا آسف جدا.

13:13.166 --> 13:16.600
أتمنى حقًا أن
يكون لدي أخبار أفضل لك.

13:20.767 --> 13:21.934
تبدو جديدة حقا اليوم.

13:22.066 --> 13:23.900
لقد حالفني الحظ في
السوق هذا الصباح.

13:26.600 --> 13:28.467
هل سمعت من
أختك حتى الآن؟

13:28.600 --> 13:30.467
مجرد وضع علامة على الهاتف.

13:30.600 --> 13:31.600
حسنًا ، هذا هو الرجل الأول

13:31.734 --> 13:33.600
كانت
جادة بشأنه حقًا.

13:33.734 --> 13:35.600
نعم ، يبدو أنه بخير.

13:35.734 --> 13:37.600
في كل مرة نتحدث فيها
يزعجني

13:37.734 --> 13:40.400
لبدء الجيش الجمهوري الايرلندي أو
شراء صناديق الاستثمار المشترك

13:40.533 --> 13:42.133
أو شيء ممل بشكل لا يصدق.

13:42.266 --> 13:43.734
He has a good career,

13:43.867 --> 13:45.667
and he's only a few
years older than you-

13:45.800 --> 13:46.867
Dad.

13:47.000 --> 13:49.667
and he's only a few
years older than you-

13:49.800 --> 13:52.967
I have had a job,
at the restaurant.

13:54.867 --> 13:57.533
Have you considered
that I actually like cooking?

13:57.667 --> 13:59.133
What would you
do with your life

13:59.266 --> 14:01.066
if the restaurant isn't around?

14:01.200 --> 14:03.000
Yeah, right.

14:03.133 --> 14:04.800
Like the two biggest
workaholics I know

14:04.934 --> 14:07.600
are gonna decide to
close up and relax?

14:07.734 --> 14:09.166
Nice.

14:30.266 --> 14:32.200
I think you dropped this.

14:32.333 --> 14:33.867
Oh, thanks Jack.

14:34.000 --> 14:36.600
Spec, Zuma and Spector?

14:36.734 --> 14:37.467
You actually read this?

14:37.600 --> 14:38.800
Just keep it, okay?

14:51.934 --> 14:52.767
Thank you for staying late.

14:58.133 --> 15:01.633
When Sue and I first
arrived in Kansas,

15:01.767 --> 15:04.133
we were petrified and we knew

15:04.266 --> 15:07.066
the bonds that the
food can create.

15:07.200 --> 15:08.633
And over time,

15:08.767 --> 15:13.166
Wichita became home and
you became our family,

15:15.266 --> 15:17.767
which makes it even harder to...

15:17.900 --> 15:20.266
We're closing the
restaurant for good.

15:20.400 --> 15:21.934
The last day will
be Christmas Eve.

15:28.200 --> 15:29.734
We know this is
tough news to hear.

15:29.867 --> 15:32.867
You know, we are
old, we are tired,

15:33.000 --> 15:35.900
and we move slower
and we hurt more.

15:36.033 --> 15:37.800
We'd love to keep
the restaurant open,

15:37.934 --> 15:41.533
but you just know when
a chapter is ending.

15:41.667 --> 15:44.000
Your envelopes include
a month of severance.

15:44.133 --> 15:45.934
Why close the day
before Christmas?

15:46.066 --> 15:47.600
It's our busiest day.

15:47.734 --> 15:50.133
We want you to spend
Christmas with your loved ones.

15:50.266 --> 15:52.200
It's something you haven't
done for a long time.

15:52.333 --> 15:54.266
But some of us need this job.

15:54.400 --> 15:56.734
We'll help you
find other jobs,

15:56.867 --> 15:59.033
give you glowing recommendations.

15:59.166 --> 16:00.367
What are you gonna do?

16:01.367 --> 16:01.400
This restaurant is your life.

16:05.266 --> 16:09.800
to some developers and we've
bought a house in Flagstaff.

16:09.934 --> 16:10.834
On a golf course.

16:14.233 --> 16:15.333
Seriously, guys?

16:15.467 --> 16:18.066
You sold the Dragon and
we're moving to Arizona

16:18.200 --> 16:19.667
and you didn't
think it'd be nice

16:19.800 --> 16:21.734
to tell me before you
drop that bomb in public?

16:21.867 --> 16:23.266
Sometimes it's hard for people

16:23.400 --> 16:24.967
to move on without momentum.

16:26.934 --> 16:26.967
What's that supposed to mean?

16:32.367 --> 16:35.567
and ended up in Wichita
because I had a third cousin

16:35.700 --> 16:36.967
who owned a restaurant here.

16:38.200 --> 16:40.066
We didn't know
anything about cooking

16:40.200 --> 16:42.600
or have passion for food really.

16:42.734 --> 16:45.100
But we learned our way
around the kitchen very quickly

16:45.233 --> 16:47.266
because we had to make a living

16:47.400 --> 16:50.100
and provide a good
future for our kids.

16:50.233 --> 16:52.333
Thinking back, we
shouldn't have let the Dragon

16:52.467 --> 16:56.600
take over yours and
Romy's childhood.

16:56.734 --> 16:58.700
We wanted to keep
you guys close to us.

16:58.834 --> 17:00.934
We didn't want you to end
up toiling your lives away

17:01.066 --> 17:03.266
in a greasy kitchen like we did.

17:03.400 --> 17:05.400
But I like working here.

17:05.533 --> 17:09.800
You've used a restaurant
as a crutch for too long.

17:09.934 --> 17:11.700
You need to create
your own path.

17:14.467 --> 17:14.500
Who's gonna tell Romy?

17:19.066 --> 17:20.133
in stupid Vermont?

17:20.266 --> 17:22.133
We'll tell her
after the holiday.

17:23.133 --> 17:27.066
No, I get it more than anyone,

17:27.200 --> 17:30.133
but she would want to be
here for a real Christmas

17:30.266 --> 17:31.367
with her real family.

17:31.500 --> 17:35.867
but she would want to be
here for a real Christmas

17:36.000 --> 17:37.800
It's done, it's done.

17:56.967 --> 17:59.333
I can't believe
you grew up here.

17:59.467 --> 18:03.533
Your Christmases must
have been so wonderful.

18:03.667 --> 18:06.433
Carols around the piano,
snowball fights in the yard,

18:06.567 --> 18:09.166
presents under a
freshly picked tree

18:09.300 --> 18:12.000
with just the right ratio
of tinsel and ornaments.

18:12.133 --> 18:14.800
Somebody's watched too
many Christmas movies.

18:14.934 --> 18:17.133
All my life I've wanted
to anticipate Christmas

18:17.266 --> 18:18.467
instead of dreading it.

18:18.600 --> 18:21.166
Other kids got to spend
Christmas baking cookies

18:21.300 --> 18:24.200
and building snowmen
and opening presents.

18:24.333 --> 18:26.433
We spent Christmas
slinging egg foo young

18:26.567 --> 18:28.300
and refilling jasmine tea.

18:30.033 --> 18:30.934
My parents were too busy

18:34.200 --> 18:39.033
So, this will be my
first real Christmas,

18:39.166 --> 18:40.433
like ever (laughs).

18:44.133 --> 18:48.166
Oh!
- Mom, Dad, this is Romy.

18:48.300 --> 18:49.033
Nice to meet you.

18:49.166 --> 18:50.200
Welcome to our home.

18:50.333 --> 18:52.033
We have heard such
wonderful things.

18:52.166 --> 18:53.000
Oh!

18:55.300 --> 18:55.333
So nice to meet you.

18:58.200 --> 19:01.500
Wow, that is so
thoughtful, Romy.

19:01.633 --> 19:05.000
Would you mind if I keep
this outside on the porch?

19:07.633 --> 19:09.400
Our Moxie gets into everything

19:09.533 --> 19:12.100
and poinsettias can
be toxic to animals.

19:15.266 --> 19:17.500
Yeah, no worries

19:17.633 --> 19:18.934
I totally get it.

19:19.066 --> 19:20.467
- Well, let's get inside.
- Yeah!

19:20.600 --> 19:21.333
Great.

19:38.533 --> 19:41.467
You have such a lovely
home, Mrs. Bennett.

19:41.600 --> 19:44.066
Thank you, but
please, call me Tinsley.

19:45.400 --> 19:45.433
Oh my, and what
a beautiful tree.

19:51.400 --> 19:54.066
Oh, but it looks so real.

19:54.200 --> 19:55.233
Where is everybody?

19:56.367 --> 19:56.400
Outback building a snowman.

20:01.600 --> 20:02.467
- Always look for-
- Uncle Blake!

20:02.600 --> 20:05.400
Hey! Oh!

20:05.533 --> 20:07.100
Hi, you must be Bridgett!

20:07.233 --> 20:08.967
- And who are you?
- Bridgett.

20:09.100 --> 20:10.200
I am so sorry.

20:10.333 --> 20:13.066
- And who are you?
- Bridgett.

20:13.200 --> 20:14.467
I'm Dylan, Blake's brother.

20:15.533 --> 20:16.367
- I'm Jen, the sister-in-law.
- Oh!

20:16.500 --> 20:17.200
- Hey.
- So nice

20:17.333 --> 20:18.233
to meet you in person.

20:18.367 --> 20:20.133
- Oh.
- Nice to meet you.

20:20.266 --> 20:22.133
Yeah, we were startin' to
think you were like Pearl.

20:22.266 --> 20:23.066
Pearl?

20:23.200 --> 20:24.533
Blake's imaginary friend.

20:24.667 --> 20:26.400
Oh, from when he was little?

20:26.533 --> 20:27.266
Try 12.

20:27.400 --> 20:28.633
Hey, let's zip it.

20:30.066 --> 20:31.133
You know what?

20:31.266 --> 20:33.200
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

20:33.333 --> 20:34.200
Oh!

20:34.333 --> 20:36.133
This is what you get!

20:36.266 --> 20:37.066
Oh!

20:37.200 --> 20:38.500
Oh, oh, oh.

20:38.633 --> 20:39.767
Are you okay?

20:39.900 --> 20:43.900
Oh, oh, oh.

20:45.333 --> 20:46.467
I'm (chuckles)...

20:46.600 --> 20:47.600
Sorry.
- It's all right.

20:47.734 --> 20:50.934
It's okay (chuckles).

20:51.066 --> 20:52.000
Yes, please, thank you.

20:52.133 --> 20:53.533
I'm gonna need those.

20:53.667 --> 20:55.266
Hey (speaking faintly).

20:55.400 --> 20:56.367
Let's go.

20:56.500 --> 20:57.600
- Oh my gosh!
- Oh my God.

20:57.734 --> 20:59.600
- I'm so sorry, Nate.
- Oh no, I'm so sorry.

20:59.734 --> 21:01.533
I didn't see you there.

21:03.300 --> 21:04.133
Oh...

21:04.266 --> 21:05.333
Oh, thank you (chuckles).

21:05.467 --> 21:08.900
Oh...

21:09.033 --> 21:10.333
I thought you were
taking the week off

21:10.467 --> 21:12.200
for some family fun time.

21:12.333 --> 21:13.133
Yeah-

21:13.266 --> 21:14.667
Daddy, can I have the markers?

21:14.800 --> 21:16.000
Yes, you can.

21:16.133 --> 21:17.200
Yes, here honey.

21:17.333 --> 21:19.000
Here. There you go.

21:19.133 --> 21:20.000
Hi, Veronica.

21:20.133 --> 21:21.567
- Hi.
- I like your shoes.

21:21.700 --> 21:23.233
Oh, these old things?

21:24.400 --> 21:26.400
They feel just like
butter on my feet.

21:26.533 --> 21:27.266
I'm kidding.

21:27.400 --> 21:28.433
They're awful.

21:28.567 --> 21:29.667
Don't ever throw
away your sneakers.

21:32.800 --> 21:34.333
So what are you guys doing here?

21:34.467 --> 21:35.333
We were just-

21:35.467 --> 21:37.400
So what are you guys doing here?

21:37.533 --> 21:40.066
Now dad wants to take us
to some boring museum.

21:40.200 --> 21:44.033
The
Children's Museum.

21:44.166 --> 21:45.467
So, hosting an event

21:45.600 --> 21:47.133
where they celebrate
Christmas traditions

21:47.266 --> 21:48.600
from around the world.

21:48.734 --> 21:51.400
It's gonna be nonstop
food and drink.

21:51.533 --> 21:52.934
Plenty of fun.

21:53.066 --> 21:55.066
Just the opposite
of boring, Jessa.

21:55.200 --> 21:58.266
And they have a make your
own wreath competition,

21:58.400 --> 22:01.667
which is why we are gathering
some supplies from reception.

22:01.800 --> 22:03.500
I hope that's not
an HR violation.

22:04.767 --> 22:07.100
Well, last week I may
or may not have taken

22:07.233 --> 22:08.533
some paper towels
from the break room

22:08.667 --> 22:11.100
because I was too tired to
go to the grocery store,

22:11.233 --> 22:12.400
so your secret's safe with me.

22:12.533 --> 22:14.500
- Okay.
- Dad, I'm hungry.

22:14.633 --> 22:16.400
- Huh?
- I'm hungry.

22:16.533 --> 22:18.400
Right. Yes, yes, of course.

22:18.533 --> 22:21.233
Well, how about we
get some takeout

22:21.367 --> 22:22.467
from the Dragon on the way home?

22:22.600 --> 22:25.233
You better
savor those dishes.

22:25.367 --> 22:26.200
I know, right?

22:26.333 --> 22:27.333
Jim and Sue are like family.

22:27.467 --> 22:29.633
It's been like my second home.

22:29.767 --> 22:31.333
I thought this place
was your second home.

22:31.467 --> 22:32.734
Ha ha (chuckles).

22:32.867 --> 22:34.400
Sometimes it feels that way.

22:34.533 --> 22:36.367
Well, that's how
you became CFO,

22:36.500 --> 22:37.400
which is awesome, by the way.

22:37.533 --> 22:38.266
Congratulations.

22:38.400 --> 22:39.200
Not like me.

22:39.333 --> 22:40.467
I'm just a lowly engineer.

22:40.600 --> 22:42.333
Lowly engineer? No way.

22:42.467 --> 22:44.066
Nate, you're brilliant.

22:44.200 --> 22:46.533
You're one of the most talented
designers in the company.

22:46.667 --> 22:49.133
Oh, thank you for saying that.

22:49.266 --> 22:50.367
Daddy, look.

22:52.667 --> 22:54.400
No, no, sweetheart.

22:54.533 --> 22:55.467
No, no, no, no, no.

22:55.600 --> 22:56.467
Do not do that.

22:56.600 --> 22:58.066
Those are...

22:58.200 --> 23:00.467
I'm sorry.

23:00.600 --> 23:02.200
It's okay.

23:02.333 --> 23:03.333
It's beautiful.

23:15.800 --> 23:17.667
Golden Dragon.

23:17.800 --> 23:19.266
Hi, Sue.

23:19.400 --> 23:21.367
I wanted to order
something for my mom.

23:23.934 --> 23:26.400
Oh, I know your
interview is at three,

23:26.533 --> 23:28.200
but is there time
for you to squeeze

23:28.333 --> 23:29.800
in one more delivery
on your way?

23:38.867 --> 23:39.600
What are you doing here?

23:39.734 --> 23:40.533
I didn't order anything.

23:40.667 --> 23:41.834
This is for you.

23:42.867 --> 23:42.900
This note came with it.

23:43.300 --> 23:45.734
"Send

23:47.667 --> 23:50.400
before the Dragon
closes this week."

23:50.533 --> 23:51.367
Closes?

23:52.600 --> 23:53.800
Sue never said a peep.

23:53.934 --> 23:55.533
Yeah, it was a
shock to all of us.

23:57.467 --> 23:58.834
Okay, I'll see you later.

24:01.400 --> 24:03.200
That's really unsafe.

24:03.333 --> 24:06.367
I know, Jerry used to take
care of all those kinda things.

24:09.734 --> 24:10.867
Let me fix that for you.

24:11.000 --> 24:12.266
- Really?
- Yeah, yeah.

24:12.400 --> 24:13.367
Aw.

24:16.233 --> 24:17.233
Okay, all set.

24:18.333 --> 24:19.533
Thank you. Looks great.

24:19.667 --> 24:20.600
Now, if you'll excuse me,

24:20.734 --> 24:21.533
I'm running late for like

24:21.667 --> 24:23.633
Now, if you'll excuse me,

24:26.333 --> 24:27.467
Oh no!

24:27.600 --> 24:29.600
Miguel, are you okay?

24:44.734 --> 24:47.233
Ms. Roberts, I am so sorry.

24:54.867 --> 24:57.467
It is now 3:18.

24:57.600 --> 24:59.467
- I was working and I-
- That's okay.

24:59.600 --> 25:01.233
Let's just get on with it.

25:01.367 --> 25:02.633
Cool?
- Yeah.

25:05.600 --> 25:07.934
Good grades,
great test scores.

25:08.066 --> 25:09.400
Thank you, Ma'am.

25:09.533 --> 25:11.900
But your extracurriculars,
where are they?

25:13.400 --> 25:15.367
I work 30 hours a week,
plus all AP classes.

25:15.500 --> 25:17.533
I don't exactly have time
for the debate team, so-

25:17.667 --> 25:19.867
What about your
community service?

25:20.000 --> 25:21.033
Volunteer positions?

25:22.667 --> 25:25.233
Does playing bingo
with some feisty ladies

25:25.367 --> 25:27.000
at the nursing home
count (chuckles)?

25:33.867 --> 25:35.734
This scholarship is
given by my company

25:35.867 --> 25:38.000
to someone who is involved
with their community

25:38.133 --> 25:39.834
in a deep and meaningful way.

25:41.867 --> 25:43.033
You're a nice young man, Miguel,

25:51.934 --> 25:54.700
Thanks.

25:56.934 --> 25:59.467
Hi, Mom.
- Thank you for the moo shu.

25:59.600 --> 26:00.934
I know how much you love it.

26:01.066 --> 26:02.834
We had those lovely
Sunday night dinners

26:02.967 --> 26:04.934
there with your dad.

26:05.066 --> 26:07.500
On the rare occasions
when he would show up.

26:09.066 --> 26:11.400
Well, the portions are so big,

26:11.533 --> 26:13.700
wanna come over and
share it with me tonight?

26:14.800 --> 26:16.066
How 'bout tomorrow?

26:16.200 --> 26:18.333
I could help you
prep for the party.

26:18.467 --> 26:19.667
Be there in the afternoon.

26:34.200 --> 26:37.066
Oh my gosh, I am so excited
for these roasts chestnuts.

26:37.200 --> 26:39.000
They only have them
this time of year, Dad.

26:39.133 --> 26:40.567
Like only once.

26:40.700 --> 26:41.533
I know.

26:41.667 --> 26:43.467
Like only once.

26:43.600 --> 26:45.967
in cinnamon and sugar
or the spicy ones

26:46.100 --> 26:47.533
that burn your tongue.

26:47.667 --> 26:48.533
Which are your favorite?

26:48.667 --> 26:51.667
that burn your tongue.

26:51.800 --> 26:53.567
Oh, how very
traditional of you.

26:53.700 --> 26:55.066
I'm a traditional girl, Daddy.

26:55.200 --> 26:56.667
You are, are ya?

26:56.800 --> 26:57.867
Mom usually brings
us first thing

26:58.000 --> 27:00.066
in the morning 'cause
they sell out fast.

27:00.200 --> 27:01.934
Yeah, it'll be fine.
They're just chestnuts.

27:02.066 --> 27:05.000
Um...

27:05.133 --> 27:06.467
You've gotta be...

27:06.600 --> 27:07.633
It's not even noon.

27:08.667 --> 27:11.533
Told you, Dad.

27:11.667 --> 27:12.600
Okay, a little less attitude
would be great, Jessa.

27:15.500 --> 27:17.667
Having a fun vacation
would be great.

27:17.800 --> 27:18.667
Are you?

27:18.800 --> 27:20.066
All we've done is have fun.

27:20.200 --> 27:22.000
Just because you take
us to lots of places

27:22.133 --> 27:24.533
and spend lots of money on
us does not make it fun.

27:29.600 --> 27:29.633
Okay, fine.

27:33.467 --> 27:36.400
I wanna practice my lines
for the Christmas pageant,

27:36.533 --> 27:37.500
and just go home.

27:39.934 --> 27:42.934
Okay.

27:43.066 --> 27:43.800
Come on.

27:53.934 --> 27:57.000
Sure this is your
childhood bedroom?

27:57.133 --> 27:58.200
Pretty sure, yeah.

27:58.333 --> 28:00.934
Sure this is your
childhood bedroom?

28:01.066 --> 28:03.967
and they fit right back into
their teenage environment.

28:04.100 --> 28:09.033
You know, like walls plastered
with posters of muscle cars,

28:10.600 --> 28:13.467
shelves lined with trophies,
beds with Star War sheets.

28:13.600 --> 28:14.734
I wasn't really
a Star Wars fan.

28:14.867 --> 28:16.133
And we're supposed to
look at your yearbooks

28:16.266 --> 28:17.734
and make fun of your haircuts.

28:17.867 --> 28:18.667
You do that already.

28:18.800 --> 28:21.066
Oh, and where is your desk?

28:21.200 --> 28:23.867
I just use my
laptop on my bed.

28:24.000 --> 28:24.834
Oh.

28:26.934 --> 28:26.967
I always wanted a desk so bad,

28:33.333 --> 28:36.000
because we were always at
the Dragon after school.

28:36.133 --> 28:37.867
So they gave us the table
to do our homework at,

28:38.000 --> 28:39.834
and not the good corner table,

28:39.967 --> 28:42.066
but the bad one near
the men's bathroom.

28:42.200 --> 28:44.133
I'm sorry, babe.

28:44.266 --> 28:47.200
It's where I did my homework
every day after school.

28:47.333 --> 28:49.100
It's where I studied
for the SATs.

28:49.233 --> 28:52.633
It's where I found out I
got into NYU (chuckles).

28:53.934 --> 28:56.600
It's where my first
boyfriend broke up with me.

28:56.734 --> 28:58.200
Sounds like The
Golden Dragon means more

28:58.333 --> 29:00.533
to you than you'd like to admit.

29:04.066 --> 29:07.066
You are not going to
get me that easy, Blake.

29:07.200 --> 29:08.667
No tears this holiday.

29:08.800 --> 29:13.266
I am a ball of light and
love and holiday cheer.

29:15.734 --> 29:15.767
Come here.

29:20.800 --> 29:22.133
Yeah!

29:22.266 --> 29:23.266
Yes!

29:23.400 --> 29:24.734
That's what I'm talking about.

29:24.867 --> 29:25.667
Woo!

29:25.800 --> 29:27.066
Let's go!
- Yes.

29:27.200 --> 29:30.934
I think this room needs
some Christmas sparkle.

29:31.066 --> 29:33.800
But babe, there's nothing
more Christmas than football.

29:33.934 --> 29:35.533
Oh, I just thought
it would be fun

29:35.667 --> 29:37.633
if we all built a
gingerbread house together.

29:37.767 --> 29:40.166
But we're already
together watching football.

29:40.300 --> 29:42.000
That's a great idea, Romy.

29:42.133 --> 29:45.166
Let's all take a
break from the game.

29:55.300 --> 29:57.800
Maybe you didn't
add enough frosting.

29:57.934 --> 30:00.300
I don't know, I've
never built one before.

30:03.000 --> 30:04.200
Oh, oh!

30:10.033 --> 30:11.000
Oh, oh!

30:16.400 --> 30:18.300
Yeah.

30:18.433 --> 30:21.166
My first gingerbread house
was a complete disaster.

30:22.767 --> 30:23.433
It wasn't a disaster, it
was just not up to code.

30:30.066 --> 30:31.033
Oh, it's Rick.

30:31.166 --> 30:31.934
- I'm gonna go in.
- Yeah.

30:33.333 --> 30:35.266
Hey.
- It is insanity over here.

30:35.400 --> 30:37.800
I've only got a sec, but
I thought you should know,

30:37.934 --> 30:40.800
even though Mom and Dad
don't want me to tell you.

30:40.934 --> 30:43.633
This is sounding
pretty ominous.

30:43.767 --> 30:45.300
Mom and Dad sold
the restaurant.

30:47.734 --> 30:49.734
What?

30:49.867 --> 30:51.166
Yeah, Christmas
Eve is our last night

30:51.300 --> 30:52.600
and then we're closed forever.

30:54.867 --> 30:56.133
Hey, someone just
dropped a whole tray

30:56.266 --> 30:57.133
of steamed pork buns.

30:57.266 --> 30:58.600
I gotta go.
- Oh...

31:05.467 --> 31:06.333
How's Rick?

31:08.800 --> 31:11.567
My parents sold
the restaurant.

31:11.700 --> 31:13.734
What?

31:13.867 --> 31:15.734
Romy, I am so sorry.

31:15.867 --> 31:18.867
Why didn't they tell me
sooner so that I could be there?

31:19.000 --> 31:19.967
Are you okay?

31:29.333 --> 31:30.066
Romy?

31:37.867 --> 31:39.066
I said no tears.

31:40.100 --> 31:41.133
Oh no.

31:41.266 --> 31:42.166
No way.

31:51.400 --> 31:53.033
- Hey.
- You finally got it fixed.

31:53.166 --> 31:54.266
Yeah.

31:54.400 --> 31:56.867
Go Mom, finding
your inner handyman.

31:57.000 --> 31:59.166
No (chuckles), it was
actually the delivery driver

31:59.300 --> 32:00.867
from The Golden Dragon.

32:01.000 --> 32:02.934
He's such a nice young man.

32:03.066 --> 32:04.467
He was even running
late for an interview

32:04.600 --> 32:06.834
and he still volunteered
to fix it for me.

32:06.967 --> 32:08.800
And then the poor kid
ripped his jacket.

32:08.934 --> 32:10.500
Had to loan him one
of Daddy's suits.

32:25.400 --> 32:27.734
When are you getting
rid of Dad's old chair?

32:27.867 --> 32:30.066
Your Dad
sat in that chair

32:30.200 --> 32:32.333
every night reviewing
his playbook.

32:32.467 --> 32:34.800
Well, you can redecorate now.

32:34.934 --> 32:36.767
Make the house more you.

32:39.467 --> 32:42.066
Maybe take down
some of Dad's stuff.

32:42.200 --> 32:44.767
No, I'm proud of
his accomplishments.

32:45.867 --> 32:48.100
You were a
brilliant architect.

32:48.233 --> 32:51.066
The only woman on track
for partner at your firm.

32:51.200 --> 32:52.734
You coulda kept working,

32:52.867 --> 32:54.967
actually done something
that made you happy.

32:56.600 --> 32:59.467
I wanna get your idea on
party decorations, please.

32:59.600 --> 33:01.133
Used to be quite the crafter.

33:01.266 --> 33:03.300
When I had a life
outside of work.

33:04.900 --> 33:08.200
I remember staying up all
night with you before the party,

33:08.333 --> 33:11.266
making hundreds of origami
snowflakes, you remember?

33:11.400 --> 33:13.000
You were so relentless.

33:13.133 --> 33:16.300
Had to make sure that every
fold was perfect and precise.

33:16.433 --> 33:18.834
Where do you think I
learned that from, huh?

33:20.333 --> 33:22.467
You should just relax this year.

33:22.600 --> 33:23.767
Maybe even cancel.

33:23.900 --> 33:24.867
People will understand.

33:25.000 --> 33:26.133
I'm not canceling!

33:27.200 --> 33:33.767
This party has
happened for 30 years.

33:33.900 --> 33:36.033
Did you have your
appointment with Dr. Cohen?

33:37.000 --> 33:37.533
Yep.

33:37.667 --> 33:38.900
And?

33:40.000 --> 33:42.467
And nothing.

33:42.600 --> 33:43.834
It didn't take.

33:44.934 --> 33:46.133
Can you do another
round of IVF?

33:46.266 --> 33:48.300
I've already done four.

33:48.433 --> 33:52.066
The hormones are really messing
with my body and the cost,

33:52.200 --> 33:54.200
well, I'd have to
get another promotion

33:54.333 --> 33:55.200
in order to afford it,

33:55.333 --> 33:56.867
but then I'll be
working too much

33:57.000 --> 33:58.300
to even hang out with my kid.

33:59.467 --> 33:59.500
I know what that's
like, all too well.

34:03.767 --> 34:08.567
I'm sorry, Mom, I'm just...

34:12.333 --> 34:14.000
It's been a hard day.

34:14.133 --> 34:15.300
Yeah, I know.

34:34.266 --> 34:35.533
Time to write your
note to Santa.

34:35.667 --> 34:36.567
No thanks.

34:37.500 --> 34:39.367
We do this every year, Jessa.

34:39.500 --> 34:41.500
Do you think Santa
knows about the time

34:41.633 --> 34:44.900
I hid my brussel sprouts
in the bushes outside?

34:46.133 --> 34:47.867
Or should I tell him about that?

34:48.000 --> 34:49.934
I definitely wanna
be on the nice list.

34:50.066 --> 34:51.467
It's not gonna happen.

34:51.600 --> 34:53.133
You're naughty all the way.

34:53.266 --> 34:55.834
Jessa, don't get your
tinsel in a tangle.

34:55.967 --> 34:57.066
Gimme that tablet.

34:57.200 --> 34:59.433
I'm almost at level 33.

34:59.567 --> 35:03.133
Why don't we run your
lines for the pageant, hm?

35:03.266 --> 35:05.200
- Really?
- Absolutely.

35:05.333 --> 35:07.333
You said you were
getting nervous.

35:07.467 --> 35:08.333
Okay.

35:08.467 --> 35:10.000
You said you were
getting nervous.

35:10.133 --> 35:11.934
We're standing up
because we always

35:12.066 --> 35:14.934
must practice as we perform.

35:15.066 --> 35:16.100
- Okay.
- Go for it.

35:19.033 --> 35:19.066
"Let us...

35:26.800 --> 35:27.633
Sweetheart?

35:29.200 --> 35:30.400
It's okay.

35:34.467 --> 35:35.934
You don't.

35:36.066 --> 35:36.600
I?

35:36.734 --> 35:37.934
Are you kidding me?

35:38.066 --> 35:39.834
I don't?

35:39.967 --> 35:44.066
You are looking at someone
who once took four semesters

35:44.200 --> 35:48.266
of French to get out of one
semester of public speaking.

35:48.400 --> 35:50.266
I couldn't even barely watch
somebody else speak publicly.

35:50.400 --> 35:51.166
Really?

35:51.300 --> 35:52.667
Yeah.

35:52.800 --> 35:55.133
Then I got a job at this company

35:55.266 --> 35:58.166
and I had to give a
lot of presentations,

36:01.066 --> 36:05.433
You wanna know my secret?

36:08.500 --> 36:11.467
Hey Romy, if you ever
wondered how much I love you,

36:11.600 --> 36:12.700
this is proof.

36:14.467 --> 36:15.734
I feel ridiculous.

36:15.867 --> 36:17.533
You feel ridiculous?

36:17.667 --> 36:18.533
So, how does this work?

36:18.667 --> 36:20.367
Do I just go knock on the door?

36:21.633 --> 36:23.333
I don't know.

36:23.467 --> 36:27.600
- I guess.
- We've never done it before.

36:27.734 --> 36:29.567
Okay, I'll go do it.

36:30.467 --> 36:31.333
All right.

36:39.700 --> 36:41.533
We're here to sing carols.

36:43.200 --> 36:44.367
Why?

36:44.500 --> 36:46.266
To spread holiday cheer.

36:46.400 --> 36:48.767
Nope.

36:50.133 --> 36:53.600
♪ Good tidings we bring
to you and your kin ♪

36:58.400 --> 37:02.567
♪ Oh, Christmas tree,
oh, Christmas tree ♪

37:02.700 --> 37:06.800
♪ How lovely are thy branches ♪

37:06.934 --> 37:10.800
♪ Oh, Christmas tree,
oh, Christmas tree ♪

37:10.934 --> 37:14.767
♪ How lovely are thy branches ♪

37:22.467 --> 37:25.133
Sorry the caroling
was such a disaster.

37:25.266 --> 37:30.233
I mean, I knew it would
be, but I'm still sorry.

37:32.467 --> 37:35.266
What's the point of living
in this winter wonderland

37:35.400 --> 37:37.700
if you're not swept up
in Christmas spirit?

37:39.800 --> 37:40.800
Could this angst
have something

37:40.934 --> 37:42.700
to do with The Golden
Dragon closing?

37:44.333 --> 37:44.367
Of course not.

37:56.667 --> 37:57.500
Thank you.

38:01.033 --> 38:03.266
I forget how beautiful
it can be here.

38:04.433 --> 38:06.867
You can always move
back after graduation.

38:07.000 --> 38:09.367
I already have a job lined up.

38:09.500 --> 38:10.867
Huh, really?

38:11.000 --> 38:12.600
Yeah, I interned
with this really

38:12.734 --> 38:14.867
great political action
coalition over the summer,

38:15.000 --> 38:16.967
so I'm going to start
as a coordinator,

38:17.100 --> 38:19.500
get some experience
in a nonprofit space,

38:19.633 --> 38:22.367
and then go to law school
and clerk for a judge

38:22.500 --> 38:23.667
and then run for office.

38:25.867 --> 38:28.500
Well, sounds like you've
got everything figured out.

38:28.633 --> 38:30.567
I guess college just
caught up to me.

38:30.700 --> 38:32.867
Soon I'll be
homeless and jobless.

38:33.000 --> 38:34.967
Really nailing that life thing.

38:35.100 --> 38:36.967
Maybe it's for the best.

38:37.100 --> 38:38.900
I know, my parents
have worked hard.

38:39.033 --> 38:40.734
They deserve a break.

38:40.867 --> 38:43.934
Well, sure, but I meant
for the best for you.

38:46.600 --> 38:48.300
Yeah?

38:48.433 --> 38:50.300
I mean, you don't have
the best track record

38:50.433 --> 38:52.200
for taking charge
of your future.

38:52.333 --> 38:53.367
I can take charge.

38:57.033 --> 38:58.967
There's actually
something I've been dying

38:59.100 --> 39:01.533
to do since I got back home.

39:01.667 --> 39:02.767
If you're game?

39:06.767 --> 39:09.633
You know, you are
gonna have to let go

39:09.767 --> 39:12.667
of those presents at some point.

39:12.800 --> 39:14.400
I'm fine just watching.

39:15.800 --> 39:17.033
You know, my cousin told me

39:17.166 --> 39:19.367
that you missed all of
your classes sophomore year

39:19.500 --> 39:20.900
and that's why you flunked out.

39:22.633 --> 39:22.667
I had everything
in high school,

39:28.767 --> 39:33.367
Better schools, better jobs.

39:35.667 --> 39:36.767
If you're not
happy with your life,

39:40.533 --> 39:44.367
Change what you can
and work on the rest.

39:46.066 --> 39:51.900
Take action.

39:52.033 --> 39:52.867
Oh, oh (laughs)!

40:05.100 --> 40:06.967
When you promised
me a midnight snack,

40:07.100 --> 40:09.834
this isn't quite
what I was thinking.

40:09.967 --> 40:11.767
I need to
decompress after that.

40:13.567 --> 40:14.000
And cooking is my meditation.

40:19.433 --> 40:24.500
So there's this kid's
Christmas event happening

40:27.033 --> 40:27.867
at the church tomorrow,

40:30.834 --> 40:34.300
Kids in foster care will
create this wish registry

40:34.433 --> 40:36.633
like a bridal or
a baby shower one,

40:36.767 --> 40:39.633
and people will buy
the gifts anonymously

40:39.767 --> 40:42.033
and then we wrap
them and have Santa

40:42.166 --> 40:43.900
and his elves pass them out.

40:45.033 --> 40:46.367
Sounds really nice.

40:46.500 --> 40:48.700
Well, my cousin was
supposed to go with me,

40:48.834 --> 40:50.633
but she's got the flu.

40:50.767 --> 40:54.600
So, do you wanna be my plus one?

40:56.033 --> 40:57.500
You'd have to dress up as a elf,

40:57.633 --> 40:59.734
but I promise you the tights
are super comfortable.

41:01.700 --> 41:02.700
Sounds like fun.

41:02.834 --> 41:04.700
Minus the tights part.

41:06.100 --> 41:06.133
Really?

41:08.200 --> 41:10.433
I'd love to spend as much time

41:12.000 --> 41:13.700
with you as I can
while you're home.

41:23.767 --> 41:25.000
Nice job.

41:25.133 --> 41:27.367
I see you're makin' progress.

41:27.500 --> 41:30.834
Jack, I don't know how you
talk me into these things.

41:30.967 --> 41:33.133
Well, you know, I usually
have my pal help me.

41:34.834 --> 41:35.767
Pal, huh?

41:35.900 --> 41:36.967
Mm hm.

41:37.100 --> 41:38.633
Is there a lady friend
I should know about?

41:38.767 --> 41:40.433
It would take a
very special lady

41:40.567 --> 41:42.500
to live up to my Margaret,

41:42.633 --> 41:44.867
and I haven't met one yet
and I probably never will.

41:45.000 --> 41:47.834
So, is this helper your
secret Santa gift or something?

41:47.967 --> 41:49.433
It's Miguel.

41:49.567 --> 41:50.367
Miguel?

41:50.500 --> 41:51.600
From The Golden Dragon.

41:52.967 --> 41:54.700
- He shovels your snow?
- Yes.

41:54.834 --> 41:58.633
He cuts my grass, cleans my
ceiling fans, bears my gutters.

41:58.767 --> 42:00.633
Oh, you
know, actually,

42:00.767 --> 42:03.967
I gotta ask him about fixing
the screen on my back door.

42:04.100 --> 42:07.934
Maybe power wash the back patio,
dust off the top cabinets.

42:08.066 --> 42:09.400
Saw someone used
the grill last night

42:09.533 --> 42:10.767
and didn't clean it again.

42:10.900 --> 42:11.700
Sorry, dude.

42:11.834 --> 42:13.533
I had Sadie over last night

42:13.667 --> 42:15.667
and I totally
forgot to clean up.

42:15.800 --> 42:18.066
Sadie? Nice, man.

42:18.200 --> 42:19.767
When are you gonna
see her again?

42:21.200 --> 42:22.633
Tonight.

42:22.767 --> 42:24.700
I'm helping her hand out
gifts at this toy drive.

42:24.834 --> 42:25.567
Tonight?

42:25.700 --> 42:26.500
Are you crazy?

42:26.633 --> 42:27.433
Your dad is gonna kill you.

42:27.567 --> 42:28.367
Oh, no, no, no.

42:28.500 --> 42:29.600
Your dad is gonna kill you.

42:29.734 --> 42:31.500
I already already double
or large table reservations, es

42:31.633 --> 42:33.166
so should be able to sneak out

42:33.300 --> 42:35.533
for a couple hours
without anyone noticing.

42:39.166 --> 42:41.100
You know, maybe it
wouldn't be the worst thing

42:41.233 --> 42:44.433
your dad saw the mess,
found out that you cook.

42:44.567 --> 42:45.667
Just like it wouldn't
be the worst thing

42:45.800 --> 42:47.066
if your dad found out
you've been hiding

42:47.200 --> 42:48.867
your college acceptance letters?

42:58.033 --> 42:58.967
- Veronica.
- Hey.

42:59.100 --> 43:00.133
Hey, how are ya?

43:00.266 --> 43:01.767
Good.

43:01.900 --> 43:03.500
I don't think I've ever
seen you dress so casually.

43:03.633 --> 43:04.633
You're always in a power suit.

43:06.133 --> 43:08.033
What are you doin' here, Nate?

43:08.166 --> 43:10.133
Well, I was just
dropping off the girls

43:10.266 --> 43:12.867
at pageant practice and I
thought I'd surprise them

43:13.000 --> 43:15.767
with their mom's famous
roast chicken, but-

43:15.900 --> 43:17.600
I'm guessing that
didn't go so well?

43:17.734 --> 43:19.767
No, no it didn't at all.

43:19.900 --> 43:21.166
Let's just say
that a smoke alarm

43:21.300 --> 43:23.567
may have been sacrificed
in the mayhem.

43:25.233 --> 43:26.900
So.

43:27.033 --> 43:29.500
Don't try too hard
to be the fun parent.

43:29.633 --> 43:31.934
Sometimes just being
there to listen is enough.

43:33.633 --> 43:34.767
Wise words.

43:34.900 --> 43:35.867
I know.

43:36.000 --> 43:36.767
Here you go.

43:36.900 --> 43:38.100
- Oh, thank you.
- Thanks.

43:41.166 --> 43:43.767
Actually, you know, I
don't have to pick them up

43:43.900 --> 43:45.834
for at least another hour.

43:45.967 --> 43:47.734
Is there anywhere
you needed to be?

43:49.100 --> 43:51.500
Are Jessa and Vivi
excited about the pageant?

43:51.633 --> 43:53.900
Oh, Vivi's a total ham.

43:54.033 --> 43:56.233
She cannot wait to be
the center of attention

43:56.367 --> 43:58.033
and be right up on that stage.

43:58.166 --> 44:00.100
Jessa on the other hand,

44:00.233 --> 44:02.667
she suffers from
terrible stage fright.

44:02.800 --> 44:04.967
So, any production she's ever
been a part of growing up

44:05.100 --> 44:07.033
has always ended up
in complete disaster.

44:07.166 --> 44:09.033
Yikes.

44:09.166 --> 44:13.967
Speaking of which, what
are you doing tomorrow night?

44:14.100 --> 44:15.934
There's an extra special
pageant happening

44:16.066 --> 44:17.200
that you may know about.

44:18.367 --> 44:19.967
The girls would be
psyched to see you.

44:20.100 --> 44:22.066
You wanna come?

44:22.200 --> 44:26.700
Oh Nate, I would love to,
but tomorrow's my mom's party.

44:26.834 --> 44:29.700
I'm not really looking
forward to socializing

44:29.834 --> 44:31.934
with a hundred of her
and my dad's friends,

44:33.066 --> 44:35.066
but I need to be there for her.

44:35.200 --> 44:36.033
And for you.

44:46.166 --> 44:46.900
Oh, there you are.

44:47.033 --> 44:48.033
Are you going someplace?

44:48.166 --> 44:49.166
Just a quick errand.

44:49.300 --> 44:50.567
I'll be back before
the dinner rush.

44:50.700 --> 44:51.700
No, no, no, I need
you in the kitchen.

44:51.834 --> 44:52.834
Just 30 minutes.

44:52.967 --> 44:53.800
I have to tell
Sadie that I can't-

44:53.934 --> 44:56.633
Just 30 minutes.

44:58.767 --> 44:58.800
Let me text her.

45:02.100 --> 45:04.967
I'll promise you, you'll
get a break later, okay?

45:18.900 --> 45:19.734
Hey, it's Rick.

45:19.867 --> 45:20.900
I probably won't listen to this.

45:41.367 --> 45:44.166
Hey man, everything okay?

45:44.300 --> 45:47.166
She won't
return my calls.

45:48.567 --> 45:49.934
I was supposed to meet her
at the church last night,

45:50.066 --> 45:51.467
but I was stuck helping my dad.

45:52.834 --> 46:01.166
I've blown my chance
with her, again.

46:01.300 --> 46:03.867
Okay,
time to open presents.

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
Oh, aren't we supposed
to open presents

46:06.133 --> 46:10.433
on Christmas morning, not
10 a.m. on Christmas Eve?

46:10.567 --> 46:13.233
The kids were always so
impatient with their presents

46:13.367 --> 46:15.133
that they couldn't wait
till Christmas morning.

46:15.266 --> 46:16.367
So, one year we decided

46:16.500 --> 46:18.767
to let them open
presents a day early.

46:18.900 --> 46:21.433
But then the
tradition just stuck.

46:21.567 --> 46:24.033
Besides, we like to spend
our Christmas Eve night

46:24.166 --> 46:25.166
at our favorite restaurant.

46:25.300 --> 46:26.500
We've been going
there for years.

46:26.633 --> 46:29.834
- The Swan House.
- Oh, sounds very elegant.

46:30.967 --> 46:32.834
Oh, thank you.

46:39.233 --> 46:39.266
Oh, it's beautiful.

46:44.100 --> 46:47.133
- Thank you.
- You're welcome, kiddo.

46:48.266 --> 46:51.100
All right, all right,
time for my gift.

46:51.233 --> 46:54.500
Oh, saving the best for last.

46:54.633 --> 46:56.767
I can't wait to
see what's inside.

47:08.233 --> 47:09.467
Do you like it?

47:11.200 --> 47:11.400
Blake,

47:39.467 --> 47:39.500
Mom, where are you?

47:43.900 --> 47:48.300
What happened to the party?

47:51.367 --> 47:53.567
Couldn't do it.

47:53.700 --> 47:54.533
Not alone.

47:56.433 --> 48:00.300
I emailed out a
cancellation to everyone.

48:00.433 --> 48:01.967
Except me?

48:02.100 --> 48:03.233
We both not
would've been buried

48:03.367 --> 48:05.600
in your inbox until
St. Patrick's Day.

48:06.700 --> 48:06.734
I'll give you that one.

48:11.533 --> 48:13.433
It's okay, it's just a party.

48:13.567 --> 48:16.066
It's not just a
party, it is my life.

48:17.233 --> 48:18.166
I can't do this alone.

48:26.500 --> 48:26.533
but we both know the truth.

48:31.400 --> 48:32.300
Players needed him.

48:32.433 --> 48:33.967
We needed him, too.

48:34.100 --> 48:36.500
Your father was very
important to this community,

48:37.567 --> 48:37.600
and I had to be supportive.

48:42.233 --> 48:44.367
before you gave it
all up to become

48:44.500 --> 48:46.033
some Division One coach's wife?

48:46.166 --> 48:47.300
Veronica, raising a family

48:47.433 --> 48:49.233
was the greatest joy in my life.

48:49.367 --> 48:51.100
And your father was not perfect,

48:51.233 --> 48:53.300
but he was my
partner for 30 years

48:53.433 --> 48:57.467
and I can't just erase
all traces of him
the moment he dies.

49:00.500 --> 49:01.700
Why don't we do something?

49:01.834 --> 49:03.100
Go out?

49:03.233 --> 49:04.133
I just...

49:06.233 --> 49:09.567
I'd just like to be
alone tonight, please.

49:22.767 --> 49:24.166
Oh.

49:24.300 --> 49:27.500
Do I want you or microwave
popcorn for dinner?

49:32.333 --> 49:32.367
Mom, I knew...

49:34.667 --> 49:37.033
Do you need something?

49:38.300 --> 49:39.967
I saw your lights were on.

49:40.100 --> 49:42.633
How come you're not at your
mother's fancy shindig?

49:42.767 --> 49:43.967
She canceled.

49:44.100 --> 49:49.066
Oh, missin' your dad?

49:52.834 --> 49:54.066
but my niece hid everything.

49:56.834 --> 49:59.300
Oh, don't Scrooge out on me.

49:59.433 --> 50:01.000
It's Christmas.

50:03.567 --> 50:07.700
You did not tell
your physical therapist that.

50:07.834 --> 50:09.100
I did.

50:09.233 --> 50:11.233
The little dictator
deserved it, too.

50:13.367 --> 50:17.233
Wow, somebody's getting
cozy with Mr. Claus.

50:17.367 --> 50:19.500
I bought them all last
month in a fit of excitement

50:19.633 --> 50:21.400
when I thought I might be...

50:22.767 --> 50:22.800
Might be?

50:28.100 --> 50:29.100
Oh.

50:29.233 --> 50:30.500
But I'm not.

50:30.633 --> 50:33.200
I just, I couldn't bear to
send them back just yet.

50:36.300 --> 50:39.233
You know, Margaret and I
couldn't have children either.

50:39.367 --> 50:41.967
I didn't know that, I
thought it was by choice.

50:42.100 --> 50:45.633
Oh, we both come
from big families,

50:45.767 --> 50:48.533
but wasn't in the cards.

50:50.233 --> 50:51.300
How did you deal with it?

50:51.433 --> 50:53.967
The disappointment?

50:54.100 --> 50:56.166
14 nieces and nephews.

50:56.300 --> 50:57.233
14?

50:57.367 --> 50:59.633
That's crazy.

50:59.767 --> 51:01.700
And we had time to volunteer,

51:01.834 --> 51:03.400
be parental figures
to those kids

51:03.533 --> 51:05.533
who might not have anyone else.

51:05.667 --> 51:06.600
Still.

51:08.300 --> 51:11.166
Choosing to make
meaning out of a loss

51:11.300 --> 51:13.734
is both empowering and healing.

51:15.433 --> 51:16.767
Make this unexpected,

51:16.900 --> 51:21.066
unplanned life meaningful
and fulfilling anyways.

51:39.767 --> 51:41.367
Scooch over.

51:41.500 --> 51:42.467
- Hey.
- Hi.

51:45.433 --> 51:47.367
I figured this was more
exciting than passing out

51:47.500 --> 51:50.500
in a bag of eggnog ice cream
to some holiday movie marathon.

51:52.433 --> 51:53.667
Yeah.

51:53.800 --> 51:55.467
You're just in time.

51:57.900 --> 51:59.400
You got this, Jessa.

52:08.700 --> 52:09.467
Oh no.

52:11.333 --> 52:17.433
Excuse me a second.

52:17.567 --> 52:19.166
Sweetheart, Jessa?

52:19.300 --> 52:20.700
Dad, what are you doing?

52:20.834 --> 52:22.500
Remember what I taught you?

52:37.767 --> 52:40.500
"Let us now go unto Bethlehem

52:40.633 --> 52:42.633
to see this thing
which has come to pass,

52:42.767 --> 52:45.300
which the Lord have
made known unto to us.

52:45.433 --> 52:47.367
Make haste in this
glorious night."

53:00.834 --> 53:03.700
Yes, just right there
in the center banquet.

53:03.834 --> 53:05.433
Enjoy your meal.

53:05.567 --> 53:06.934
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

53:16.934 --> 53:19.700
All right, here's
the credit card slips.

53:19.834 --> 53:20.700
I've gotta head off to church.

53:20.834 --> 53:21.900
Okay.

53:22.033 --> 53:23.400
Oh, what happened
with the interview?

53:23.533 --> 53:25.233
You never told me how it went.

53:25.367 --> 53:26.633
Total bust.

53:26.767 --> 53:28.400
Maybe it's just not meant to be.

53:32.367 --> 53:34.166
Hey, Sadie, I just
want to explain why-

53:34.300 --> 53:35.400
Save it.

53:35.533 --> 53:38.800
Hey, Sadie, I just
want to explain why-

53:38.934 --> 53:41.400
And I'm the dumb one
who cares about you.

53:42.633 --> 53:42.667
I've cared about you for years

53:46.667 --> 53:49.633
because I'm 3,000 miles
away and it's easy.

53:49.767 --> 53:51.767
You don't do hard, ever.

54:08.433 --> 54:10.333
- Oh, hey, Jessa.
- Not now, Dad.

54:18.734 --> 54:20.400
Hey, Jessa, please.

54:21.700 --> 54:22.834
What's wrong?

54:22.967 --> 54:24.900
Could you be
more embarrassing?

54:25.033 --> 54:25.834
What?

54:25.967 --> 54:27.000
I thought it was helping.

54:35.433 --> 54:37.333
I can't seem to
do anything right.

54:38.900 --> 54:40.900
Sometimes I feel like I'm
just not cut out for this.

54:41.033 --> 54:42.834
Nate.

54:42.967 --> 54:43.700
Miguel.

54:43.834 --> 54:45.500
We're late already.

54:45.633 --> 54:47.867
Ms. Roberts, good
to see you again.

54:48.000 --> 54:48.967
Merry Christmas.

54:49.100 --> 54:50.433
You too, Miguel.

54:50.567 --> 54:52.300
Merry Christmas.

54:52.433 --> 54:53.600
You must be Luis.

54:54.567 --> 54:55.900
I'm Nate.

54:56.033 --> 54:57.600
Pleasure to finally meet you.

54:57.734 --> 54:58.567
Hello, Nate.

55:00.433 --> 55:01.767
How do you know my son?

55:01.900 --> 55:03.900
One too many orders of
sesame chicken (chuckles).

55:04.033 --> 55:05.667
I see.

55:06.900 --> 55:06.934
The Chens have been
wonderful to Miguel.

55:14.433 --> 55:15.700
where he can flourish.

55:15.834 --> 55:16.900
Okay, Papa, let's
go get a seat.

55:17.033 --> 55:18.900
Luis, you should
be incredibly proud

55:19.033 --> 55:20.700
of the man you raised.

55:20.834 --> 55:23.400
He goes above and
beyond every single day.

55:23.533 --> 55:25.767
Even looked after my kids once
when I was late coming home

55:25.900 --> 55:26.967
from the airport
at the restaurant.

55:27.100 --> 55:28.266
You remember that, Miguel?
- Yeah.

55:28.400 --> 55:29.667
Thank you.

55:29.800 --> 55:31.033
I still lawyer you for that.

55:31.166 --> 55:32.033
Anytime.

55:32.166 --> 55:35.700
I still lawyer you for that.

55:35.834 --> 55:36.734
Yeah, sure.

55:40.567 --> 55:42.367
So, you may not
have a resume full

55:42.500 --> 55:46.934
of sports and debate team
and co-op internships,

55:47.066 --> 55:50.900
but that doesn't mean you don't
care about your community.

55:51.033 --> 55:53.367
You've helped my
mom, Mr. Barber.

55:54.433 --> 55:56.500
Surely countless other people.

55:57.967 --> 55:59.633
I may have made
the wrong judgment

55:59.767 --> 56:01.567
about you on our
first interview.

56:01.700 --> 56:03.433
First? Does does that mean-

56:03.567 --> 56:05.834
This means you get
another interview.

56:05.967 --> 56:08.900
A do over, But you better
not be late this time.

56:09.033 --> 56:10.033
Okay, I promise.

56:10.166 --> 56:11.000
Okay.

56:13.900 --> 56:17.433
I was expecting
holiday ham, not Peking duck.

56:17.567 --> 56:19.767
We always eat
Chinese food on Christmas Eve.

56:19.900 --> 56:20.633
Evening folks.

56:20.767 --> 56:21.867
Have we decided?

56:22.000 --> 56:24.333
Evening folks.

56:24.467 --> 56:26.700
So let's do the orange chicken,

56:26.834 --> 56:29.834
the crab rangoon, pot stickers,

56:29.967 --> 56:31.867
chopped suey, egg foo young,

56:32.000 --> 56:34.500
oh, and the Mongolian beef.

56:34.633 --> 56:35.600
Great choices.

56:57.700 --> 56:59.367
Romy, Blake told us all about

56:59.500 --> 57:00.834
your family's
restaurant closing.

57:00.967 --> 57:03.266
I know that must be hard.

57:03.400 --> 57:05.934
Now, Jade Palace may not
live up to The Golden Dragon,

57:06.066 --> 57:07.500
but we wanted to
share it with you.

57:07.633 --> 57:09.900
What was your family
restaurant like growing up?

57:10.033 --> 57:11.800
Is Christmas as
crazy as it is here?

57:11.934 --> 57:13.033
Oh, definitely (chuckles).

57:13.166 --> 57:14.934
There were so many people,

57:15.066 --> 57:18.500
nurses and doctors,
international students,

57:18.633 --> 57:20.900
people who couldn't afford
to fly home for the holidays.

57:21.033 --> 57:22.100
And because of the Dragon,

57:22.233 --> 57:24.900
they had some place
to spend Christmas

57:25.033 --> 57:27.433
along with all the other
holiday orphans in town.

57:27.567 --> 57:31.967
We made a family, and
made new traditions.

57:32.100 --> 57:34.567
That
sounds lovely, Romy.

57:34.700 --> 57:36.967
Yeah, actually it was.

57:42.166 --> 57:45.967
This Nate, he sure
thinks highly of you.

57:46.100 --> 57:48.033
Yeah, he's a great guy, so.

57:48.166 --> 57:49.567
Mm hm.

57:49.700 --> 57:51.000
And the woman he was with,

57:52.834 --> 57:55.433
what did you two sneak
off to talk about?

57:55.567 --> 57:56.500
She's the administrator

57:56.633 --> 57:58.066
of the scholarship I applied to.

57:59.667 --> 58:06.166
I actually think I might have
a chance of getting it, so.

58:06.300 --> 58:07.033
Papa?

58:22.700 --> 58:24.567
How long have you had these?

58:24.700 --> 58:29.667
A few weeks.

58:36.700 --> 58:38.233
It's a terrible feeling

58:38.367 --> 58:43.033
to see a child's dreams sleep
away because I'm a failure.

58:43.166 --> 58:44.233
Are you serious?

58:44.367 --> 58:45.567
You're not a failure.

58:46.767 --> 58:48.233
You're the kind of
man I want to be,

58:48.367 --> 58:51.567
the kind of man who sacrifices
everything for his family.

58:51.700 --> 58:54.867
Yeah, sometimes it's
better to be selfish.

58:58.033 --> 58:59.200
Now are we going to
look at these at schools

59:02.166 --> 59:03.667
and burning our marshmallows?

59:06.667 --> 59:11.633
Wow.

59:11.767 --> 59:12.967
Oh, excuse me.

59:13.100 --> 59:15.100
The paramedic that's
waiting for her food,

59:15.233 --> 59:18.233
would you please put
her order on our bill,

59:18.367 --> 59:21.667
and tell her that it's a thank
you from her secret Santa.

59:23.834 --> 59:26.233
Wow, that's very nice.

59:26.367 --> 59:27.633
Not everyone gets to be near

59:27.767 --> 59:29.734
their loved ones
during the holidays.

59:38.100 --> 59:43.066
You all are amazing and I'm
so sorry, but I have to go.

59:47.100 --> 59:47.934
Home.

59:49.367 --> 59:50.100
To Kansas.

59:56.200 --> 59:57.100
I'll book your flight.

59:57.233 --> 59:58.967
I'll drive you to the airport.

59:59.100 --> 1:00:00.100
I'll make snacks for the road.

1:00:00.233 --> 1:00:01.667
I'll help you pack.

1:00:01.800 --> 1:00:03.667
I'll lend you my new
noise canceling headphones

1:00:03.800 --> 1:00:04.600
for the plane.

1:00:07.033 --> 1:00:08.200
And I'll go with you.

1:00:08.333 --> 1:00:09.667
Really?

1:00:09.800 --> 1:00:10.834
Yes!

1:00:22.200 --> 1:00:25.667
enjoying Christmas morning.

1:00:52.100 --> 1:00:53.734
Rick, right here.

1:00:54.967 --> 1:00:56.100
Romy, what are you doing?

1:00:56.233 --> 1:00:58.767
Shh, I don't want
Mom and Dad to see.

1:00:58.900 --> 1:01:00.633
Why?

1:01:00.767 --> 1:01:02.367
Because we're opening
the restaurant today.

1:01:03.767 --> 1:01:04.867
We're what now?

1:01:05.000 --> 1:01:06.767
Mom and Dad don't
realize how important

1:01:06.900 --> 1:01:10.367
the Dragon is to
this town, and to me.

1:01:11.967 --> 1:01:14.233
All those people who depend on
us for their Christmas meals,

1:01:14.367 --> 1:01:18.100
the ones who are alone
or lost or abandoned,

1:01:18.233 --> 1:01:21.834
or just want a nice meal
that they don't have to cook,

1:01:21.967 --> 1:01:23.200
where will they go today?

1:01:24.166 --> 1:01:26.000
Who will feed them?

1:01:26.133 --> 1:01:27.900
We already gave the
staff the day off.

1:01:28.033 --> 1:01:29.700
So we'll find temporary staff.

1:01:34.100 --> 1:01:35.233
I'll be the chef.

1:01:35.367 --> 1:01:36.200
Yes!

1:01:37.367 --> 1:01:38.300
Good.

1:01:40.834 --> 1:01:41.867
You already knew about that?

1:01:42.000 --> 1:01:43.667
I have spies all
over the Dragon.

1:01:44.367 --> 1:01:45.967
Oh.

1:01:46.100 --> 1:01:47.100
You must be Blake.

1:01:47.233 --> 1:01:48.700
Hey, nice to finally
meet you, man.

1:01:48.834 --> 1:01:49.700
You too, Rick.

1:01:49.834 --> 1:01:51.767
Hey, nice to finally
meet you, man.

1:01:51.900 --> 1:01:53.633
Romy's a little
tired of the one dish

1:01:53.767 --> 1:01:55.367
I know how to make and I hear

1:01:55.500 --> 1:01:57.967
you have insane cooking skills.

1:01:58.100 --> 1:02:00.200
I'd be totally down for that.

1:02:00.333 --> 1:02:01.800
Let me grab a jacket.
- Go.

1:02:03.166 --> 1:02:04.066
We're gonna do it.

1:02:04.200 --> 1:02:05.033
Okay.

1:02:07.433 --> 1:02:09.233
Can't believe you got me this.

1:02:09.367 --> 1:02:11.800
Yeah, well, you
mentioned it awhile ago.

1:02:11.934 --> 1:02:13.100
Probably totally uncool by now,

1:02:13.233 --> 1:02:16.433
but I think it's pretty awesome.

1:02:16.567 --> 1:02:17.667
You were talking
about how you wanted

1:02:17.800 --> 1:02:19.834
to try to make some jewelry, so.

1:02:19.967 --> 1:02:23.233
I didn't think you'd remember,
or that you were listening.

1:02:23.367 --> 1:02:24.934
I'm always listening, kiddo.

1:02:34.166 --> 1:02:38.166
I'm sorry, Dad, for yelling
at you after the pageant

1:02:38.300 --> 1:02:40.934
and just being a
really big brat lately.

1:02:41.066 --> 1:02:43.367
I've just been kinda
sad since Mom left.

1:02:43.500 --> 1:02:45.166
Your mom will be home soon.

1:02:45.300 --> 1:02:47.767
I know, but then
we'll live in two houses

1:02:47.900 --> 1:02:49.166
and have two birthdays and have

1:02:49.300 --> 1:02:50.700
to pick between
you guys for stuff.

1:02:50.834 --> 1:02:52.767
You never have
to pick between us.

1:02:52.900 --> 1:02:54.900
Me and your mom may not
be together anymore,

1:02:55.033 --> 1:02:56.867
but we'll still
always be a family.

1:02:59.300 --> 1:03:01.367
I'll tell you what,

1:03:01.500 --> 1:03:04.400
why don't we try to make Mom's
famous cinnamon buns, hm?

1:03:05.300 --> 1:03:06.100
Yeah.

1:03:10.633 --> 1:03:10.667
Get your own bowl
of cereal, stealer.

1:03:16.166 --> 1:03:18.900
Where did I put the...

1:03:19.033 --> 1:03:19.867
No. Oh!

1:03:23.166 --> 1:03:23.200
Ah ha.

1:03:28.266 --> 1:03:29.834
make cinnamon rolls
like your mom,

1:03:29.967 --> 1:03:33.367
so I think it's time we
start a new tradition.

1:03:38.400 --> 1:03:42.367
Oo.

1:04:10.166 --> 1:04:14.100
Romy, why aren't
you in Vermont?

1:04:14.233 --> 1:04:16.200
Slight change of plans.

1:04:16.333 --> 1:04:18.300
We're opening up
the Dragon today.

1:04:18.433 --> 1:04:19.467
We need your help.

1:04:19.600 --> 1:04:23.200
I'd love to, but
it's Christmas.

1:04:24.367 --> 1:04:26.166
He will be there.

1:04:26.300 --> 1:04:28.900
You're okay with me leaving
the family on Christmas?

1:04:29.033 --> 1:04:32.033
The Chen's have treated
you like a son for years.

1:04:32.166 --> 1:04:34.433
That makes them
part of our family,

1:04:34.567 --> 1:04:36.233
and we don't let family down.

1:04:49.433 --> 1:04:50.800
Merry Christmas.

1:04:50.934 --> 1:04:51.967
Mom.

1:04:52.100 --> 1:04:54.066
Hi, what are you doing here?

1:04:57.033 --> 1:04:57.066
I mean, Merry Christmas.

1:05:11.033 --> 1:05:13.533
So, how's your morning been?

1:05:16.367 --> 1:05:19.367
I've definitely lost the
touch over the past few years.

1:05:19.500 --> 1:05:21.967
Oh, honey, you have
so many other talents.

1:05:22.100 --> 1:05:24.467
Don't focus on the one
thing you're not perfect at.

1:05:26.300 --> 1:05:26.333
Thanks, Mom.

1:05:28.734 --> 1:05:32.633
Of course I did.

1:05:38.767 --> 1:05:40.367
I want you to have this.

1:05:40.500 --> 1:05:42.166
You didn't have
to do this, Mom.

1:05:42.300 --> 1:05:43.467
Just open it.

1:05:52.000 --> 1:05:54.367
I want you to know who I was

1:05:54.500 --> 1:05:57.066
before I became a wife or a mom.

1:05:58.533 --> 1:05:59.967
You were a partner?

1:06:00.166 --> 1:06:02.500
Well, technically I
didn't accept the promotion.

1:06:02.633 --> 1:06:04.700
I would've had to live
in Copenhagen for a year,

1:06:04.834 --> 1:06:07.200
and that was right when your dad

1:06:07.333 --> 1:06:09.066
was offered the
head coaching job.

1:06:15.000 --> 1:06:19.367
I didn't call him back.

1:06:22.166 --> 1:06:24.066
Call who back?

1:06:25.300 --> 1:06:27.967
Dad.

1:06:28.100 --> 1:06:29.367
Two days before
his heart attack,

1:06:29.500 --> 1:06:32.367
he dropped off a brochure,
some cruise in Europe.

1:06:32.500 --> 1:06:35.033
I was focused on a
project and I figured

1:06:35.166 --> 1:06:36.667
it was just the
same old routine,

1:06:37.834 --> 1:06:40.033
making promises he
would never keep.

1:06:40.166 --> 1:06:41.200
No.

1:06:41.333 --> 1:06:43.734
He wanted me to
finally see Copenhagen,

1:06:45.333 --> 1:06:49.233
and Paris and Prague
and all those places

1:06:49.367 --> 1:06:51.066
that I always
dreamed of visiting.

1:06:53.734 --> 1:06:53.767
He felt guilty, but
he didn't need to.

1:06:59.367 --> 1:07:03.834
I knew what I was giving up,

1:07:06.367 --> 1:07:09.266
but I also knew
what I was getting.

1:07:11.633 --> 1:07:13.500
He left me a voice message.

1:07:13.633 --> 1:07:14.467
Yeah?

1:07:17.166 --> 1:07:22.133
He sounded really sad and
he really wanted to meet up.

1:07:23.500 --> 1:07:25.066
But I, well, I was angry
and I didn't call him back.

1:07:25.200 --> 1:07:29.467
And then he was gone,

1:07:33.300 --> 1:07:35.433
and now I'm just gonna be a
disappointment to you too.

1:07:35.567 --> 1:07:36.567
- Oh, no!
- I'll never make

1:07:36.700 --> 1:07:37.700
you a grandmother.

1:07:37.834 --> 1:07:40.467
Honey, I am so proud of you.

1:07:42.367 --> 1:07:44.433
And you'll get through
this and I will be there

1:07:44.567 --> 1:07:46.633
every step of the
way right with you.

1:07:48.567 --> 1:07:48.600
Okay?

1:07:56.900 --> 1:07:57.767
Oh.

1:08:01.767 --> 1:08:01.800
Okay.

1:08:04.900 --> 1:08:06.500
Merry Christmas.

1:08:06.633 --> 1:08:09.867
Right now?

1:08:10.000 --> 1:08:12.266
Sure, I could do that.

1:08:12.400 --> 1:08:15.266
Can I bring a plus one?

1:08:15.400 --> 1:08:18.133
This is good.

1:08:19.367 --> 1:08:20.700
Mm.

1:08:20.834 --> 1:08:23.734
I think I even like this
better than sour gummies.

1:08:25.633 --> 1:08:29.433
How about tomorrow we'll go
get doughnuts and go sledding?

1:08:29.567 --> 1:08:30.767
I call the biggest hill first.

1:08:35.233 --> 1:08:36.734
Hello, this is...

1:08:36.867 --> 1:08:37.867
Oh, hey Miguel.

1:08:39.500 --> 1:08:40.834
Yeah, sure, no problem.

1:08:40.967 --> 1:08:42.233
We're on our way.

1:08:42.367 --> 1:08:44.433
You guys, get your coats on.

1:08:44.567 --> 1:08:45.533
Our friends need us.

1:08:46.567 --> 1:08:54.300
Let's go.

1:08:54.433 --> 1:08:55.700
Thank you all so
much for dropping

1:08:55.834 --> 1:08:57.567
your Christmas
plans to come here.

1:08:57.700 --> 1:09:00.600
It's going to be out of
all of our comfort zones,

1:09:00.734 --> 1:09:03.967
but I think we owe the
Dragon one last hurrah.

1:09:04.100 --> 1:09:05.300
We're gonna be busy.

1:09:05.433 --> 1:09:06.700
Insane is more like it.

1:09:06.834 --> 1:09:09.300
We already have dozens of
reservations for dinner.

1:09:09.433 --> 1:09:11.467
Our usual vendors are closed,

1:09:11.600 --> 1:09:12.433
so we're gonna have to make do

1:09:12.567 --> 1:09:14.233
with grocery meat and produce.

1:09:14.367 --> 1:09:16.567
Romy and Blake, they're gonna
be on kitchen duty with me.

1:09:16.700 --> 1:09:18.567
Nate, I'm gonna need
you to grab the sauce bins

1:09:18.700 --> 1:09:20.367
from the fridge and fill
up all the dispensers.

1:09:20.500 --> 1:09:21.433
Right.

1:09:21.567 --> 1:09:22.834
from the fridge and fill
up all the dispensers.

1:09:22.967 --> 1:09:25.333
so I'm gonna put you on dicing.

1:09:25.467 --> 1:09:26.500
Hm.

1:09:26.633 --> 1:09:27.867
Jess and Vivi,
I'm gonna teach you

1:09:28.000 --> 1:09:30.700
how to make the best hand
rolled dumplings ever.

1:09:31.967 --> 1:09:34.900
Luis, I'm going to
need you to be mingling

1:09:35.033 --> 1:09:37.900
in the dining room
entertaining our guests.

1:09:38.033 --> 1:09:39.000
And what about me?

1:09:40.333 --> 1:09:41.633
Host stand.

1:09:41.767 --> 1:09:43.767
You wanna waste all this
pizazz on the host stand?

1:09:45.133 --> 1:09:47.467
You wanna waste all this
pizazz on the host stand?

1:09:47.600 --> 1:09:50.300
so our novice kitchen staff
doesn't get overwhelmed.

1:09:50.433 --> 1:09:52.700
Oh, so I get to tell
people what to do.

1:09:52.834 --> 1:09:56.700
Yes, but only
if you wear this.

1:09:56.834 --> 1:10:00.500
Oh!

1:10:00.633 --> 1:10:03.867
May, I (throat clears)?

1:10:05.867 --> 1:10:05.900
- Wow.
- That's perfect.

1:10:11.900 --> 1:10:12.700
Let's get started.

1:10:12.834 --> 1:10:13.700
Ready.

1:10:13.834 --> 1:10:14.900
- Let's go.
- Come on.

1:10:15.033 --> 1:10:16.900
Here you are, a
fish fileting guru,

1:10:17.033 --> 1:10:18.567
and yet for our first dinner,

1:10:18.700 --> 1:10:20.734
you made me microwave popcorn?

1:10:22.500 --> 1:10:24.500
Maybe I just
forgot how fun it is

1:10:24.633 --> 1:10:25.934
to cook for people you love.

1:10:27.100 --> 1:10:28.900
We have to break
them off like this

1:10:29.033 --> 1:10:29.900
and throw them in here?

1:10:30.033 --> 1:10:31.767
- Okay.
- Like it's a big tree

1:10:31.900 --> 1:10:33.734
and you're taking
the branches off.

1:10:33.867 --> 1:10:34.800
You're a natural.

1:10:40.433 --> 1:10:45.400
Oh!

1:10:54.033 --> 1:10:55.300
- All right.
- You watching?

1:10:55.433 --> 1:10:56.467
I'm watching.

1:10:57.767 --> 1:10:58.500
All right, you get a bundle.

1:10:58.633 --> 1:10:59.500
Okay.

1:10:59.633 --> 1:11:01.033
- And stir it.
- That's it?

1:11:01.166 --> 1:11:01.900
That's all I have to do?

1:11:02.033 --> 1:11:03.033
That's it,

1:11:03.166 --> 1:11:04.367
and just wait a minute.
- I can do that.

1:11:04.500 --> 1:11:06.367
- Oh, oh!
- Jeez, all right.

1:11:06.500 --> 1:11:07.800
Hey, guys, guys, hey, hey,

1:11:07.934 --> 1:11:09.900
break it up, break it up,
break it up, break it up.

1:11:11.500 --> 1:11:11.533
Dude, you're leaving?

1:11:14.767 --> 1:11:16.033
There's just a stop
I have to make.

1:11:16.166 --> 1:11:18.633
Well, what's more
important than this?

1:11:18.767 --> 1:11:19.800
My life.

1:11:20.934 --> 1:11:20.967
What?

1:11:24.633 --> 1:11:27.300
I don't think I can
live with regret.

1:11:39.800 --> 1:11:40.633
Rick?

1:11:42.767 --> 1:11:44.800
What are you doing here?

1:11:44.934 --> 1:11:48.000
And why are you dressed
like a 1980s wedding singer?

1:11:49.900 --> 1:11:49.934
This was the last tie
they had at the shop.

1:11:53.533 --> 1:11:56.000
Will you please go

1:11:57.500 --> 1:12:01.433
to the Dragon tonight
at eight wearing this?

1:12:03.633 --> 1:12:04.567
And that dress I never
got to see you in?

1:12:04.700 --> 1:12:08.800
Sadie Cohen,

1:12:08.934 --> 1:12:13.433
will you go to prom with me?

1:12:30.500 --> 1:12:34.100
You know, you can't
just do one big gesture

1:12:34.233 --> 1:12:35.900
and then expect
everything to be forgiven.

1:12:36.033 --> 1:12:36.867
I know that,

1:12:38.133 --> 1:12:39.834
which is why I just
want this to be

1:12:39.967 --> 1:12:44.867
the first teensy eensy littlest
possible step towards that.

1:12:48.767 --> 1:12:49.500
That's it.

1:13:09.066 --> 1:13:10.033
Ta da.

1:13:10.166 --> 1:13:12.100
My table.

1:13:12.233 --> 1:13:14.033
So this is where
all the magic happens?

1:13:14.166 --> 1:13:16.800
All the major milestones
in my life happened here.

1:13:18.166 --> 1:13:18.200
Care to add one more?

1:13:24.066 --> 1:13:26.767
Are you asking me what
I think you're asking me?

1:13:26.900 --> 1:13:29.667
Because I am going
to be so mad at you

1:13:29.800 --> 1:13:30.934
that my engagement
selfie is of me

1:13:31.066 --> 1:13:33.433
in a sesame oil stained shirt.

1:13:33.567 --> 1:13:35.533
Life isn't perfect.

1:13:35.667 --> 1:13:40.500
Christmas isn't perfect,
couples aren't perfect.

1:13:42.667 --> 1:13:44.900
But sometimes it's
the imperfections

1:13:45.033 --> 1:13:47.934
that make something
so worthwhile.

1:13:51.100 --> 1:13:51.133
You're right.

1:13:56.066 --> 1:14:00.867
I want all the messy and
difficult and awkward things.

1:14:02.367 --> 1:14:04.800
I wanna learn and grow and
remember and be grateful.

1:14:04.934 --> 1:14:09.700
I wanna do all of that with you.

1:14:09.834 --> 1:14:14.233
Romy Chen, will you marry me?

1:14:28.734 --> 1:14:33.300
You may say there are
no perfect Christmases,

1:14:35.900 --> 1:14:38.700
but I beg to differ.

1:14:45.166 --> 1:14:46.767
I love it.
- You do? Good.

1:14:46.900 --> 1:14:51.867
I love it.

1:14:53.233 --> 1:14:56.033
I can't believe
that kid sneaking out

1:14:56.166 --> 1:14:59.166
on Christmas and making me
come out in the cold like this.

1:14:59.300 --> 1:15:00.200
He's lost, Jim.

1:15:00.333 --> 1:15:02.033
He's still searching for his...

1:15:21.834 --> 1:15:22.734
What's going on?

1:15:23.700 --> 1:15:25.900
Your last dinner service.

1:15:26.033 --> 1:15:29.200
Mom, Dad, I'll take
you to your table.

1:15:33.233 --> 1:15:34.066
This way.

1:15:35.767 --> 1:15:37.100
How did you pull this off?

1:15:37.233 --> 1:15:39.900
It was mostly Romy's idea.

1:15:40.033 --> 1:15:41.300
Romy?

1:15:41.433 --> 1:15:44.633
I may be jet lagged and
I definitely need a shower,

1:15:44.767 --> 1:15:47.166
but I would never miss
our last Christmas here!

1:15:47.300 --> 1:15:49.200
Oh, Romy!

1:15:52.100 --> 1:15:54.700
I invited some regulars.

1:15:54.834 --> 1:15:56.100
Plus I texted every phone number

1:15:56.233 --> 1:15:58.100
from last year's
Christmas reservations.

1:15:58.233 --> 1:15:59.233
I might have carpal tunnel,

1:15:59.367 --> 1:16:02.000
but it got us a
pretty decent crowd.

1:16:02.133 --> 1:16:04.033
Oh, you didn't have
to do this for us.

1:16:04.166 --> 1:16:07.266
You've served all of
us all of these years,

1:16:07.400 --> 1:16:09.233
now it's time for
you to be served.

1:16:12.100 --> 1:16:15.033
Ah, Ma, this is Blake.

1:16:15.166 --> 1:16:17.834
Blake, meet my
wonderful parents.

1:16:17.967 --> 1:16:18.834
Blake!

1:16:18.967 --> 1:16:19.800
Hi (laughs).

1:16:21.967 --> 1:16:24.033
Why aren't you
with your family?

1:16:24.166 --> 1:16:27.667
Well, Romy is family now.

1:16:29.100 --> 1:16:30.600
We're engaged!

1:16:30.734 --> 1:16:33.133
Oh, Romy! That's wonderful.

1:16:34.367 --> 1:16:35.333
Don't worry, the
real ring's coming

1:16:38.500 --> 1:16:40.900
Welcome to the family, son.

1:16:45.033 --> 1:16:45.300
Come, come.
- All right, all right.

1:17:06.200 --> 1:17:07.033
Wow.

1:17:08.567 --> 1:17:11.367
I can't believe I almost missed
seeing you in this dress.

1:17:11.500 --> 1:17:13.900
I can't believe this dress
still actually fits me.

1:17:16.367 --> 1:17:19.000
Don't leave me alone on
the dance floor, Rick Chen.

1:17:19.900 --> 1:17:20.967
No, Ma'am.

1:17:43.166 --> 1:17:44.467
Oh, what is this?

1:17:46.233 --> 1:17:47.667
Can I please have this dance?

and see if I can find a job
as a sous chef somewhere.

1:18:07.367 --> 1:18:07.400
Do you know anyone with a couch
that I could crash on maybe?

1:18:17.900 --> 1:18:19.333
I want you in my life, Sadie.

1:18:20.300 --> 1:18:22.734
And if that means friendship,

1:18:22.867 --> 1:18:25.500
and nothing romantic would
ever happen, that's fine.

1:18:25.633 --> 1:18:28.033

1:18:50.500 --> 1:18:52.834

"What I did for my
Christmas vacation"

1:18:54.166 --> 1:18:55.300
portion of the

Hm.

1:19:23.300 --> 1:19:23.333
Pretty impressive.

1:19:28.433 --> 1:19:31.900
Creativity
is important,

1:19:32.033 --> 1:19:35.367
but you have got to get
the basics down too.

1:19:35.500 --> 1:19:37.900
You can show me
some tricks sometime.

1:19:38.033 --> 1:19:39.467
I'd like nothing better, Son.

1:19:40.500 --> 1:19:40.533
Thanks, Dad.

1:19:46.700 --> 1:19:49.433
We understand that this tree

1:19:49.567 --> 1:19:53.300
has ornaments from all
your customers and friends.

1:19:55.066 --> 1:19:59.333
Before you turn that
sign to close for good,

1:19:59.467 --> 1:20:01.333
we would like to
give you something.

1:20:03.700 --> 1:20:06.567
Me abuelito, my
grandfather gave me this

1:20:06.700 --> 1:20:08.166
when I was just a boy.

1:20:09.700 --> 1:20:11.567
We were leaving Guadalajara

1:20:11.700 --> 1:20:15.567
on Christmas Eve
to come to America,

1:20:15.700 --> 1:20:18.033
and he knew then
that we probably

1:20:18.166 --> 1:20:20.266
would not see each other again.

1:20:23.233 --> 1:20:23.834
Saint Christopher

1:20:31.033 --> 1:20:32.333
I remember that feeling

1:20:33.500 --> 1:20:37.367
when we left our homes
to come to the U.S.

1:20:37.500 --> 1:20:42.266
It was pure hope and pure
fear at the same time.

1:20:43.433 --> 1:20:46.333
I was so anxious
that I accidentally

1:20:46.467 --> 1:20:49.166
wore two different
shoes on the flight.

1:20:51.600 --> 1:20:55.266
I remember that (laughs).

1:20:56.700 --> 1:20:56.734
I made this in preschool
when I was two or three.

1:21:08.233 --> 1:21:09.600
I made this special for you.

1:21:11.400 --> 1:21:16.133
Thank you.

1:21:16.266 --> 1:21:19.967
This is symbolic
so that I remember

1:21:20.100 --> 1:21:23.667
to love myself as much
as I love anyone else.

1:21:29.100 --> 1:21:31.300
My mom got this from
me after my dad won

1:21:31.433 --> 1:21:33.500
his first NCAA tournament game.

1:21:34.700 --> 1:21:36.633
She was so proud of him,

1:21:36.767 --> 1:21:39.333
but of course I never even
took it out of the box.

1:21:43.100 --> 1:21:43.133
My dad loved it here,

1:21:46.567 --> 1:21:50.633
Even though I didn't show it.

1:22:00.100 --> 1:22:00.967
Oh, honey.

1:22:06.367 --> 1:22:06.400
We'll remember
that wherever we are,

1:22:12.767 --> 1:22:14.467
this family with us.

1:22:35.700 --> 1:22:37.467
Here's the thing,

1:22:37.600 --> 1:22:40.300
Christmas looks
different for everyone.

1:22:40.433 --> 1:22:41.967
Maybe it's embracing the change

1:22:42.100 --> 1:22:43.433
to create new traditions,
- So impressive

1:22:43.567 --> 1:22:44.400
you're bilingual.

1:22:44.533 --> 1:22:46.233
to create new traditions,
- So impressive

1:22:46.367 --> 1:22:48.967
a part of achieving our dreams.

1:22:49.100 --> 1:22:50.600
It could be letting
go of expectations

1:22:50.734 --> 1:22:53.633
around what you think
the holidays should be.

1:22:53.767 --> 1:22:55.500
Pushing forward with
resilience and hope

1:22:55.633 --> 1:22:57.233
to create a new normal,

1:22:57.367 --> 1:23:01.767
and understanding that our
challenges don't define us.

1:23:01.900 --> 1:23:06.000
Christmas makes us realize we
may actually find everything

1:23:06.133 --> 1:23:09.233
we want if we adjust
our perspective.

1:23:09.367 --> 1:23:12.033
And it doesn't matter if
we throw festive parties,

1:23:12.166 --> 1:23:15.767
or watch football, or
even roll dumplings.

1:23:15.900 --> 1:23:16.800
It's Mom.

1:23:16.934 --> 1:23:18.100
or watch football, or
even roll dumplings.

1:23:18.233 --> 1:23:20.367
if you spend it with family,

1:23:20.500 --> 1:23:23.667
because the greatest gifts
can't be traveled to,

1:23:23.800 --> 1:23:27.300
owned, earned,
worn, or consumed.

1:23:27.433 --> 1:23:30.367
The greatest gift we can
give ourselves and others

1:23:30.500 --> 1:23:32.433
is living in the present,

1:23:32.567 --> 1:23:34.300
and being grateful
for the lessons

1:23:34.433 --> 1:23:36.400
we've learned
throughout the year.

1:23:36.533 --> 1:23:39.200
And maybe fry a few egg
rolls while you're at it.
