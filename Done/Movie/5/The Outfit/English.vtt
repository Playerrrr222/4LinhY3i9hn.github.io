537

Some new gizmo
the Feds came up with.

538
00:30:38.338 --> 00:30:41.442
Records sound, like a Victrola.

539
00:30:41.475 --> 00:30:45.112

it's only the size of a...

540

Oh, you get it.

541
00:30:46.781 --> 00:30:52.052
The Hoover boys planted
their bug in one of our spots.

542
00:30:52.085 --> 00:30:53.353
But what they don't know

543
00:30:53.387 --> 00:30:55.522
is that we have friends
in high places.

544
00:30:55.556 --> 00:31:00.127
Friends who could do things like
smuggle us a copy of the tape.

545
00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:02.029
But before I could listen to it,

546
00:31:02.062 --> 00:31:03.598
La Fontaine's crew
rolls up on us.

547
00:31:03.631 --> 00:31:06.333
See, we're making moves on them,
and if they get the tape,

548
00:31:06.366 --> 00:31:07.769
then they'll know
how to hit back.

549
00:31:07.802 --> 00:31:09.203
Everybody wants this thing.

550
00:31:09.236 --> 00:31:12.105
So throw it away.

551
00:31:12.139 --> 00:31:14.308
Somebody's been ratting us out
to La Fontaine.

552
00:31:14.341 --> 00:31:16.510
Now, somebody...

553
00:31:16.543 --> 00:31:20.047
helped the Feds get a bug on us.

554
00:31:20.080 --> 00:31:21.482
If we can listen to this thing,

555
00:31:21.515 --> 00:31:24.151
then we'll know
where it was planted. Boom.

556

If I can find a machine
to play this tape tonight,

will be here in three hours.

touches this.

"There's a new tailor in town."

he taught me how to tie a tie

when I was four.

in life, kid."

1064
00:58:52.666 --> 00:58:56.837
They're all I brought with me
when I came to Chicago.

1065
00:58:59.173 --> 00:59:00.141
- Please.
- No, no, no, no.

1066
00:59:00.174 --> 00:59:02.710
Oh, no, please. Please.

1067
00:59:05.880 --> 00:59:07.181
(sighs)

1068
00:59:14.822 --> 00:59:17.758
You never told me
why you left England.

1069
00:59:17.791 --> 00:59:19.460
It was under attack.

1070
00:59:19.493 --> 00:59:21.128
Ah, Nazis?

1071
00:59:21.162 --> 00:59:22.763
Worse.

1072
00:59:22.796 --> 00:59:24.465
They're called blue jeans.

1073
00:59:24.498 --> 00:59:27.001
(laughing)

1074
00:59:30.237 --> 00:59:31.939
I know what it's like

1075
00:59:31.972 --> 00:59:34.175
to try to make something
of yourself.

1076
00:59:34.208 --> 00:59:35.976
Yes.

1077
00:59:36.010 --> 00:59:38.045
Just you and your trusted tools.

1078
00:59:39.313 --> 00:59:41.115
For example...

1079
00:59:44.285 --> 00:59:46.320
(Roy sighs)

1080
00:59:46.353 --> 00:59:49.089
I use this thing here to kill.

1081
00:59:50.824 --> 00:59:52.326
I don't even know
how many people.

1082
00:59:52.359 --> 00:59:54.862
All right.

1083
00:59:54.895 --> 00:59:58.065
You got your tools, I got mine.
Here.

1084
00:59:58.098 --> 00:59:59.900
Take a look.

1085
01:00:02.937 --> 01:00:05.206
I read something once

1086
01:00:05.239 --> 01:00:08.075
about how the thing
that separates

1087
01:00:08.108 --> 01:00:10.077
man from monkeys is tools.

1088
01:00:10.110 --> 01:00:11.879
Do you believe all that?

1089
01:00:11.912 --> 01:00:13.714
Evolution?

1090
01:00:14.315 --> 01:00:16.217
I don't know.

1091
01:00:16.250 --> 01:00:19.820
But I do know that a man
has a choice in this world

1092
01:00:19.853 --> 01:00:21.789
about how he uses his tools.

1093
01:00:22.823 --> 01:00:24.959
He can destroy or he can build.

1094
01:00:24.992 --> 01:00:26.227
And you think I destroy.

1095
01:00:26.260 --> 01:00:29.530
But, no, with this,
I've built loyalty.

1096
01:00:29.563 --> 01:00:33.033
I have built a crew.
I've built a neighborhood.

1097
01:00:35.002 --> 01:00:37.304
And the men I've had to kill...

1098
01:00:39.139 --> 01:00:41.976
...well, you have to toss away
a few scraps, don't you,

1099
01:00:42.009 --> 01:00:44.478
when you're cutting
a pair of pants?

1100
01:00:48.382 --> 01:00:51.752
Have you ever heard of
the Outfit?

1101
01:00:52.987 --> 01:00:55.856
Well, I make clothes, so...

1102
01:00:55.889 --> 01:00:57.391
Oh, n-not that kind of outfit.

1103
01:00:57.424 --> 01:00:59.326
It's an organization.

1104
01:00:59.360 --> 01:01:01.962
What, like the Rotary Club?

1105
01:01:03.264 --> 01:01:05.065
Maybe you've heard of Al Capone?

1106
01:01:05.099 --> 01:01:06.300
Him I've heard of.

1107
01:01:06.333 --> 01:01:08.002
Yeah. He started it.

1108
01:01:08.035 --> 01:01:11.005
- The Rotary Club?
- The Outfit.

1109
01:01:11.038 --> 01:01:13.374
Al Capone's dead, isn't he?

1110
01:01:13.407 --> 01:01:15.309
After he died,

1111
01:01:15.342 --> 01:01:19.313
his organization spread out,
became more of a network.

1112
01:01:20.914 --> 01:01:26.020
Every big-time crew from
Santa Monica to Coney Island,

1113
01:01:26.053 --> 01:01:29.089
Italians in the East,
Jews in the West,

1114
01:01:29.123 --> 01:01:32.159
Poles in St. Louis...

1115
01:01:32.192 --> 01:01:36.230
even a few sons of Killarney
here and there.

1116
01:01:36.263 --> 01:01:38.832
The underworld United Nations.

1117
01:01:38.866 --> 01:01:42.369
Anybody messes with anybody,
the Outfit has your back.

1118
01:01:42.403 --> 01:01:44.171
It's like a stamp.

1119
01:01:44.204 --> 01:01:46.907
- "You have arrived."
- And have you arrived?

1120
01:01:46.940 --> 01:01:48.175
Almost.

1121
01:01:48.208 --> 01:01:50.177
They've been
sending us messages,

1122
01:01:50.210 --> 01:01:53.047
saying they like our style.

1123
01:01:53.080 --> 01:01:55.316
They're considering us,

1124
01:01:55.349 --> 01:01:57.251
if we can finish
what we started.

1125
01:01:57.284 --> 01:01:59.386
And what have you started?

1126
01:01:59.420 --> 01:02:02.056
Putting every one of
the La Fontaines in the dirt.

1127
01:02:02.089 --> 01:02:04.925
See, the La Fontaines
aren't builders.

1128
01:02:04.958 --> 01:02:06.628
That family has been running

1129
01:02:06.661 --> 01:02:08.829
the same numbers racket
for decades.

1130
01:02:09.496 --> 01:02:11.932
Their neighborhood, their rules.

1131
01:02:11.965 --> 01:02:15.169
Nobody ever had the balls
to move in on their operation.

1132
01:02:15.202 --> 01:02:16.337
Until me.

1133
01:02:16.370 --> 01:02:20.374
This tape
everyone's looking for,

1134
01:02:20.407 --> 01:02:25.279
Francis said that
some powerful friends

1135
01:02:25.312 --> 01:02:27.314
got you a copy.

1136
01:02:27.348 --> 01:02:29.249
The Outfit, they those friends?

1137
01:02:29.283 --> 01:02:31.118
Yeah, so you understand.

1138
01:02:31.151 --> 01:02:35.356
That tape gets into
the wrong hands,

1139
01:02:35.389 --> 01:02:38.359
then the entire thing
comes crashing down.

1140
01:02:38.392 --> 01:02:41.095
Mr. Boyle, why are you
telling me all this?

1141
01:02:41.128 --> 01:02:42.930
Because that's Richie's coat.

1142
01:02:42.963 --> 01:02:44.998
♪ ♪

1143
01:02:48.001 --> 01:02:49.002
Is it?

1144
01:02:49.036 --> 01:02:51.071
- It is.
- Oh.

1145
01:02:53.273 --> 01:02:56.678
Well, I suppose he must have
left without it.

1146
01:02:56.711 --> 01:02:58.245
In December?

1147
01:02:58.278 --> 01:03:00.080
He was in a bit of a hurry.

1148
01:03:00.114 --> 01:03:03.350
December in Chicago,
and he went out without a coat?

1149
01:03:05.085 --> 01:03:07.121
You're hiding something,
my friend.

1150
01:03:08.422 --> 01:03:11.258
And I'm trying
to help you understand

1151
01:03:11.291 --> 01:03:14.962
that even if I never find out
what it is, the Outfit will.

1152
01:03:14.995 --> 01:03:17.197
So you want
to get clear of this,

1153
01:03:17.231 --> 01:03:20.367
you need to tell me what really
happened in here tonight.

1154
01:03:22.503 --> 01:03:24.071
Now.

1155
01:03:24.104 --> 01:03:27.341
Mr. Boyle,
I'm telling you the truth.

1156
01:03:33.347 --> 01:03:34.915
Monk!

1157
01:03:37.317 --> 01:03:39.052
Who walks out into the cold,

1158
01:03:39.086 --> 01:03:42.456
in December, in Chicago,
without his coat?

1159
01:03:42.489 --> 01:03:44.191
I ain't good at riddles.

1160
01:03:45.225 --> 01:03:48.061
English, where's my goddamn son?

1161
01:03:49.062 --> 01:03:52.032
You got five seconds...

1162
01:03:52.065 --> 01:03:53.367
to tell me what happened.

1163
01:03:53.400 --> 01:03:56.036
Five, four...

1164
01:03:56.069 --> 01:03:57.337
(racks loudly)

1165
01:03:57.371 --> 01:03:59.506
- ...three...
- He made me promise not to tell.

1166
01:03:59.540 --> 01:04:01.508
Who? Who made you promise?

1167
01:04:01.542 --> 01:04:05.212
He said he'd kill me
if I told you.

1168
01:04:05.245 --> 01:04:06.346
Who?

1169
01:04:06.380 --> 01:04:08.348
Francis.

1170
01:04:10.350 --> 01:04:14.321
Mr. Boyle,
what really happened to Richie

1171
01:04:14.354 --> 01:04:16.156
is that Francis shot...

1172
01:04:16.190 --> 01:04:18.325
(door opens, bell jingles)

1173
01:04:18.358 --> 01:04:20.060
(door closes)

1174
01:04:20.093 --> 01:04:21.261
Whoa.

1175
01:04:27.134 --> 01:04:28.368
Full house tonight, huh?

1176
01:04:28.402 --> 01:04:29.970
Mable.

1177
01:04:30.605 --> 01:04:33.974
We got some questions
about Richie?

1178
01:04:34.609 --> 01:04:36.778
Realized I know somebody
who might have some answers.

1179
01:04:36.811 --> 01:04:38.378
ROY: Francis, English was
just about to tell me

1180
01:04:38.412 --> 01:04:40.380
what really happened to Richie.

1181
01:04:41.415 --> 01:04:43.785
English said you shot somebody.

1182
01:04:43.818 --> 01:04:45.552
Oh, yeah?

1183
01:04:47.387 --> 01:04:49.223
ROY:
Hey, don't look at her,

1184
01:04:49.256 --> 01:04:51.492
don't look at him,
you look at me.

1185
01:04:51.525 --> 01:04:53.227
If you tell me the truth,

1186
01:04:53.260 --> 01:04:56.063
there isn't a gun in this town
can hurt you.

1187
01:04:56.096 --> 01:04:59.333
You are protected from him,
you're protected from him.

1188
01:04:59.366 --> 01:05:01.401
You will be warmed
from the elements.

1189
01:05:02.402 --> 01:05:04.338
But you gotta tell me the truth.

1190
01:05:05.339 --> 01:05:07.274
What did Francis do?

1191
01:05:08.643 --> 01:05:10.477
Francis shot...

1192
01:05:10.511 --> 01:05:11.545
(gun cocks)

1193
01:05:16.116 --> 01:05:17.384
Francis shot...

1194
01:05:19.186 --> 01:05:22.389
...four of La Fontaine's men

1195
01:05:22.422 --> 01:05:24.558
earlier this evening.

1196
01:05:26.093 --> 01:05:30.163
But Richie,
he didn't shoot a single one.

1197
01:05:31.164 --> 01:05:34.368
He said he was embarrassed.

1198
01:05:34.401 --> 01:05:36.638
Ashamed.

1199
01:05:36.671 --> 01:05:40.240
He said he had to go and...

1200
01:05:40.274 --> 01:05:42.209
go and kill someone.

1201
01:05:42.242 --> 01:05:43.443
ROY:
Kill who?

1202
01:05:43.477 --> 01:05:45.212
La Fontaine.

1203
01:05:45.245 --> 01:05:49.617
Richie made us promise
not to tell you.

1204
01:05:52.887 --> 01:05:56.156
He knew what he was doing
was dangerous.

1205
01:05:56.189 --> 01:05:59.560
I suppose he didn't want you
to stop him.

1206
01:05:59.594 --> 01:06:02.062
You made Richie a promise,
English.

1207
01:06:03.598 --> 01:06:05.532
- We both did.
- Yes, we did.

1208
01:06:05.566 --> 01:06:07.467
I'm sorry, Mr. Boyle.

1209
01:06:09.469 --> 01:06:10.638
So...

1210
01:06:12.506 --> 01:06:15.175
...where's Richie now?

1211
01:06:15.208 --> 01:06:17.277
- You're the receptionist?
- Yes.

1212
01:06:17.311 --> 01:06:22.115
After Richie left,
on the way to kill La Fontaine,

1213
01:06:22.149 --> 01:06:24.184
I think he stopped by her place.

1214
01:06:24.217 --> 01:06:25.519
No, he didn't.

1215
01:06:25.552 --> 01:06:27.689
Why would he stop by
the receptionist's place?

1216
01:06:27.722 --> 01:06:30.892
- Because she's Richie's girl.
- I'm not Richie's girl.

1217
01:06:30.925 --> 01:06:32.359
- FRANCIS: The hell you're not.
- I'm not. - You're not?

1218
01:06:32.392 --> 01:06:34.361
- I'm not.
- MONK: Yeah, she is.

1219
01:06:35.362 --> 01:06:37.230
Richie likes to brag.

1220
01:06:38.231 --> 01:06:42.169
Mr. Boyle,
all I know about tonight

1221
01:06:42.202 --> 01:06:43.470
is that, at 2:00 in the morning,

1222
01:06:43.503 --> 01:06:45.640
this ham-handed jerk
knocks on my door,

1223
01:06:45.673 --> 01:06:48.508
tells me I gotta come with him,
and when I demur, he s...

1224
01:06:48.542 --> 01:06:50.510
FRANCIS:
When I come into her place,

1225
01:06:50.544 --> 01:06:52.279
there's a bloodstain
on the carpet.

1226
01:06:52.312 --> 01:06:54.281
What?

1227
01:06:54.314 --> 01:06:55.617
That's not true. That's a lie.

1228
01:06:55.650 --> 01:06:57.652
- (gasps, screams)
- Stop! Stop!

1229
01:07:00.955 --> 01:07:03.256
- Come.
- (Mable sniffles)

1230
01:07:06.226 --> 01:07:08.362
You live close?

1231
01:07:10.263 --> 01:07:11.565
Down the street.

1232
01:07:11.599 --> 01:07:13.635
Lived on this block
my whole life.

1233
01:07:13.668 --> 01:07:15.670
- What's your name?
- Mable.

1234
01:07:16.804 --> 01:07:18.405
Sean.

1235
01:07:19.406 --> 01:07:20.540
Shit.

1236
01:07:20.574 --> 01:07:22.644
Your dad was Ryan Sean.

1237
01:07:22.677 --> 01:07:25.178
MABLE:
That's what they tell me.

1238
01:07:25.212 --> 01:07:27.582
Did some work for me

1260
