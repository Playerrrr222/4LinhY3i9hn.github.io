WEBVTT

1
00:00:35.731 --> 00:00:38.560
I'm sorry things are a little
crazy right now, but...

2
00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:40.127
please tell me we're good.

3
00:00:42.259 --> 00:00:43.260
For the show, yeah.

4
00:00:45.958 --> 00:00:47.134
Beyond that, I don't know.

5
00:01:05.935 --> 00:01:07.545
<i>All right, that's a wrap
on season ten</i>

6
00:01:07.632 --> 00:01:10.983
<i>of "Celebrity Dance Off."
Great job, everyone.</i>

7
00:01:11.071 --> 00:01:12.855
<i>Let's hear it for my
amazing co-host, Joanna.</i>

8
00:01:12.985 --> 00:01:14.465
<i>Thank you, everyone.</i>

9
00:01:14.596 --> 00:01:16.396
<i>I'll meet you outside
in just a minute, Billy.</i>

10
00:01:17.903 --> 00:01:20.689
Nice job today, nice job.
Hey, great work, everyone.

11
00:01:20.776 --> 00:01:22.430
Great work. Bravo.

12
00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.867
Fantastic show.
Now get some rest.

13
00:01:24.997 --> 00:01:27.609
All right, Christmas special
rehearsal start on Monday.

14
00:01:27.696 --> 00:01:29.437
Wayne, my man!

15
00:01:29.524 --> 00:01:31.134
Terrific show tonight, huh?

16
00:01:31.221 --> 00:01:34.224
Mr. Holiday,
what else would we expect

17
00:01:34.311 --> 00:01:36.191
from the most talented man
in all of television?

18
00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.795
Not half of television...
All of television.

19
00:01:39.882 --> 00:01:40.989
That's very nice, Wayne,
but you don't

20
00:01:41.013 --> 00:01:42.333
have to say stuff
like that to me.

21
00:01:42.363 --> 00:01:43.581
Actually, I do.

22
00:01:43.712 --> 00:01:46.018
It's an executive mandate
to suck up.

23
00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:48.586
Anyways, um...

24
00:01:48.673 --> 00:01:50.980
the network has been talking,

25
00:01:51.067 --> 00:01:53.852
and I wanted to give you
a little heads up.

26
00:01:53.983 --> 00:01:55.178
Oh, yeah,
I heard the brass might

27
00:01:55.202 --> 00:01:57.291
want to make some changes
next season.

28
00:01:57.421 --> 00:01:59.945
Love it. Great idea.
Keep it fresh.

29
00:02:00.032 --> 00:02:03.384
What if we do all live shows?
Nothing like that energy.

30
00:02:03.471 --> 00:02:06.691
Yeah, well, that's changey
but not change.

31
00:02:06.822 --> 00:02:08.582
And not exactly what
the network has in mind.

32
00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:12.436
Billy, can I be honest with you?

33
00:02:12.567 --> 00:02:14.569
- I certainly hope so.
- Right.

34
00:02:14.656 --> 00:02:15.763
Ever since you and Joanna
broke up,

35
00:02:15.787 --> 00:02:18.268
the two of you
aren't working anymore.

36
00:02:18.355 --> 00:02:19.755
The audience doesn't like
the split,

37
00:02:19.835 --> 00:02:22.098
the chemistry isn't there,
and look at the ratings.

38
00:02:22.185 --> 00:02:24.622
Not as good as when you guys
were America's sweethearts.

39
00:02:29.671 --> 00:02:31.431
I can never get that whistle
into the bomb thing.

40
00:02:31.455 --> 00:02:34.241
Anyway, they want you two
to get back together.

41
00:02:34.328 --> 00:02:35.546
Well, that's not gonna happen.

42
00:02:35.677 --> 00:02:39.507
Yeah, that's what I thought
you'd say.

43
00:02:39.637 --> 00:02:43.511
So what exactly
are you trying to say, Wayne?

44
00:02:43.641 --> 00:02:45.382
What are they gonna do, fire us?

45
00:02:48.298 --> 00:02:50.692
Wait... wait, are they firing us?

46
00:02:50.822 --> 00:02:53.956
No, no, no, no.
They would never fire Joanna.

47
00:02:54.086 --> 00:02:57.046
Just you.
What?

48
00:02:57.177 --> 00:02:58.917
We can't get rid of Joanna
right now!

49
00:02:59.048 --> 00:03:00.528
Individually, she's doing great.

50
00:03:00.615 --> 00:03:02.617
People love them some J-Gar.

51
00:03:02.747 --> 00:03:05.924
And look at her ratings.
Up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up.

52
00:03:06.011 --> 00:03:07.491
And the social media followings.

53
00:03:07.622 --> 00:03:11.408
They're following Billy.
They're really following good.

54
00:03:11.539 --> 00:03:12.646
So you're just
getting rid of me?

55
00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:14.019
Totally.
But not in a bad way.

56
00:03:14.106 --> 00:03:15.499
How not in a bad way?

57
00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:17.719
I don't know why I said that.

58
00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:19.242
I guess I'm just
a people pleaser.

59
00:03:19.373 --> 00:03:20.243
You can't do this.

60
00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:21.636
This is my show!

61
00:03:21.723 --> 00:03:22.463
I created it!

62
00:03:22.593 --> 00:03:23.942
I produce it, I host it!

63
00:03:24.029 --> 00:03:26.728
I'm on all the friggin' posters.

64
00:03:26.815 --> 00:03:28.382
Keep up that fire, Billy.

65
00:03:28.512 --> 00:03:30.592
That's gonna serve you well
in landing your next gig.

66
00:03:30.688 --> 00:03:33.691
Oh, my God.

67
00:03:33.778 --> 00:03:34.910
I can't believe this.

68
00:03:37.608 --> 00:03:38.827
Fine, fine, fine.

69
00:03:38.957 --> 00:03:40.742
I'm just gonna
concentrate and pour all my

70
00:03:40.872 --> 00:03:42.023
energy into
the Christmas special.

71
00:03:42.047 --> 00:03:45.355
Ooh...

72
00:03:45.442 --> 00:03:48.445
that makes this next part
much harder to say.

73
00:03:48.576 --> 00:03:50.969
Now what?

74
00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:52.971
Are you canceling
the Christmas special too?

75
00:03:53.058 --> 00:03:54.495
No, we can't do that.

76
00:03:54.625 --> 00:03:57.149
Well, then what?

77
00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:00.457
Think of it as a re-casting.

78
00:04:00.588 --> 00:04:02.546
Hi.

79
00:04:02.633 --> 00:04:04.983
I guess you heard.

80
00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:08.596
Joanna.
Evidently you heard first.

81
00:04:08.726 --> 00:04:09.945
Shall we?

82
00:04:10.032 --> 00:04:11.294
Billy Holiday.

83
00:04:11.425 --> 00:04:14.645
God bless the child
that's got his own.

84
00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:27.615
Breaking news you will
only see here.

85
00:04:27.745 --> 00:04:29.051
"Access Hollywood" has confirmed

86
00:04:29.181 --> 00:04:30.835
that "Celebrity Dance Off" host

87
00:04:30.966 --> 00:04:33.185
and executive producer
Billy Holiday

88
00:04:33.316 --> 00:04:36.232
is leaving the show
after 10 years.

89
00:04:36.363 --> 00:04:38.669
Sources reveal that the
former dancer will also be

90
00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.281
replaced on the network's
annual Christmas special.

91
00:04:41.411 --> 00:04:42.586
In an exclusive statement,

92
00:04:42.717 --> 00:04:44.414
the network tells
"Access Hollywood,"

93
00:04:44.545 --> 00:04:48.810
"Billy has left to pursue
other exciting opportunities."

94
00:04:48.897 --> 00:04:51.247
<i>Hi, mijo, it's mom.</i>

95
00:04:51.378 --> 00:04:53.728
<i>Just wanted to call and see
if you were doing okay.</i>

96
00:04:53.815 --> 00:04:55.860
<i>I know you're not busy,
so call me back.</i>

97
00:04:55.947 --> 00:04:57.209
<i>Love you.</i>

98
00:05:34.334 --> 00:05:35.987
Yes, of course I can hold.

99
00:05:36.074 --> 00:05:37.859
- Got more tinsel.
- Oh, great.

100
00:05:37.989 --> 00:05:39.077
Hey, did you see the news?

101
00:05:39.208 --> 00:05:40.601
Billy Holiday got fired.

102
00:05:40.688 --> 00:05:42.559
Who?

103
00:05:42.646 --> 00:05:45.693
Pheebs, he's the most famous
person to come out of Garnet.

104
00:05:45.823 --> 00:05:48.870
Mom's best
dance student like, ever?

105
00:05:48.957 --> 00:05:50.195
He was the host of that
"Celebrity Dance Off" show.

106
00:05:50.219 --> 00:05:52.264
Oh, right, right,
with the dimples, yeah.

107
00:05:52.395 --> 00:05:53.875
Yeah. It's a shame.

108
00:05:53.962 --> 00:05:55.398
He was always so sweet.

109
00:05:55.485 --> 00:05:57.966
You know, Mom said he had
that X factor even as a kid.

110
00:05:58.053 --> 00:06:00.403
Well, now he's an ex-host.

111
00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:02.405
Hi, yes.

112
00:06:02.492 --> 00:06:04.842
You will? Oh!

113
00:06:04.973 --> 00:06:07.323
Thank you, Mr. Kelsey. Bye-bye.

114
00:06:07.454 --> 00:06:09.847
Okay, get this...
Until Christmas,

115
00:06:09.934 --> 00:06:11.477
Kelsey's Barbershop
is going to be giving

116
00:06:11.501 --> 00:06:14.548
half price haircuts to every
customer that buys a pair

117
00:06:14.678 --> 00:06:15.918
of tickets to the dance recital.

118
00:06:16.027 --> 00:06:19.074
Same arrangement
at Ramos Brothers Garage.

119
00:06:19.161 --> 00:06:20.684
Well, for oil changes,
not haircuts.

120
00:06:20.815 --> 00:06:22.730
Make sense.
I was worried.

121
00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:24.209
So all the money for the recital

122
00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:25.535
is going towards
that trip, right?

123
00:06:25.559 --> 00:06:26.690
Yeah.

124
00:06:26.821 --> 00:06:28.300
I'm gonna take
the kids to New York.

125
00:06:28.388 --> 00:06:29.650
Broadway, of course.

126
00:06:29.737 --> 00:06:30.912
Of course.

127
00:06:31.042 --> 00:06:32.827
Where are you
with fundraising again?

128
00:06:32.914 --> 00:06:34.829
Uh, not exactly where I thought

129
00:06:34.959 --> 00:06:36.221
I would be at this point, but

130
00:06:36.308 --> 00:06:37.938
there's still two weeks left
and people are

131
00:06:37.962 --> 00:06:39.921
always more giving
at Christmas time, right?

132
00:06:40.008 --> 00:06:44.099
Your optimism is definitely
from a gene that I didn't get.

133
00:06:44.229 --> 00:06:45.685
You know, we can
always call Mom and Dad

134
00:06:45.709 --> 00:06:46.947
and see if they have
any advice...

135
00:06:46.971 --> 00:06:49.060
Don't even suggest it.

136
00:06:49.147 --> 00:06:50.168
Okay, they've been planning
that retirement cruise

137
00:06:50.192 --> 00:06:52.063
for years, plus,

138
00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:53.650
this is my first year
running the studio.

139
00:06:53.674 --> 00:06:55.719
I kinda want to prove
to myself that I can do it.

140
00:06:55.806 --> 00:06:57.634
I'll follow your lead then.

141
00:06:57.765 --> 00:06:59.375
Thanks.
That bake sale, though.

142
00:06:59.506 --> 00:07:03.335
Now that is gonna bring in
a lot of dough.

143
00:07:03.466 --> 00:07:04.902
Pun intended.

144
00:07:04.989 --> 00:07:06.730
How much are you
charging for each cookie?

145
00:07:06.817 --> 00:07:08.340
Uh, $1.

146
00:07:08.471 --> 00:07:10.560
Yeah, that'll do it.

147
00:07:10.691 --> 00:07:13.694
Listen, I will donate
five Christmas berry pies

148
00:07:13.781 --> 00:07:16.436
from the diner
for the bake sale.

149
00:07:16.523 --> 00:07:17.698
Fine, ten pies.

150
00:07:17.828 --> 00:07:18.742
It's almost Christmas.

151
00:07:18.829 --> 00:07:20.918
11?

152
00:07:21.049 --> 00:07:23.138
Don't push it.

153
00:07:23.268 --> 00:07:24.574
Oh, shoot.

154
00:07:24.705 --> 00:07:26.073
I've got Intro to Tap
in five minutes.

155
00:07:26.097 --> 00:07:29.449
Let's get this tree
decorated quickly.

156
00:07:29.579 --> 00:07:32.321
You might need
a little insurance.

157
00:07:32.452 --> 00:07:33.801
Here.
Make a wish on the big guy.

158
00:07:35.585 --> 00:07:37.152
Need all the help I can get.

159
00:07:42.505 --> 00:07:44.725
Okay.

160
00:07:44.855 --> 00:07:47.205
Let's do this, Santa.

161
00:08:12.317 --> 00:08:13.536
Mm-hmm.

162
00:08:19.063 --> 00:08:20.369
Hmm.

163
00:08:31.685 --> 00:08:32.685
Hey, Dallas.

164
00:08:32.729 --> 00:08:34.731
Hello, "Gull-yermo."

165
00:08:34.818 --> 00:08:37.038
Its Guillermo... whatever.

166
00:08:37.168 --> 00:08:38.256
Only my mom calls me that.

167
00:08:38.343 --> 00:08:39.562
Well, good, because I'm feeling

168
00:08:39.693 --> 00:08:41.042
very maternal towards you today.

169
00:08:41.172 --> 00:08:42.652
I don't want you
to wallow in this

170
00:08:42.783 --> 00:08:44.306
pig-pen situation, you hear me?

171
00:08:44.393 --> 00:08:46.003
Put it in storage.

172
00:08:46.090 --> 00:08:47.309
It's not the end of the world.

173
00:08:47.396 --> 00:08:49.572
<i>In fact,
I just got off the phone</i>

174
00:08:49.703 --> 00:08:52.270
with an offer for you
to be the grand marshal

175
00:08:52.401 --> 00:08:53.924
of the Christmas parade.

176
00:08:54.055 --> 00:08:55.665
Yes, that's what
I'm talking about.

177
00:08:55.796 --> 00:08:57.711
I love the Hollywood
Christmas parade.

178
00:08:57.841 --> 00:08:59.147
I can totally use that
right now.

179
00:08:59.234 --> 00:09:01.105
Yeah, it's Pacoima.

180
00:09:01.236 --> 00:09:03.891
I'm sorry, did you say Pacoima?

181
00:09:04.021 --> 00:09:05.980
Yeah, that's where
the parade is.

182
00:09:06.067 --> 00:09:08.896
You know, I always thought
that there was a Y in Pacoima.

183
00:09:09.026 --> 00:09:10.985
How great
of a slogan would that be?

184
00:09:11.115 --> 00:09:15.511
There's no Y in Pacoima,
but there could be a U.

185
00:09:15.598 --> 00:09:17.576
Well, I don't care how you
spell it, it's not gonna be me.

186
00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:20.124
Okay, good.
Then we'll put a pin in it.

187
00:09:20.211 --> 00:09:21.449
Now what you got popping
on your end?

188
00:09:21.473 --> 00:09:23.301
You getting any interest?

189
00:09:23.388 --> 00:09:24.781
Only from my mom.

190
00:09:24.912 --> 00:09:26.367
She wants me to come home
for the holidays.

191
00:09:26.391 --> 00:09:27.751
You know what,
that's a great idea.

192
00:09:27.828 --> 00:09:30.613
That is the perfect place
to lay low.

193
00:09:30.744 --> 00:09:32.397
I didn't see Pacoima
as a fit, either.

194
00:09:32.484 --> 00:09:34.312
I'm glad we're on the same page.

195
00:09:34.399 --> 00:09:35.792
- We are?
- Yeah.

196
00:09:35.923 --> 00:09:38.969
Look, at the end of the day,
we take a break,

197
00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:40.817
<i>we let people miss you,
and then we circle back.</i>

198
00:09:40.841 --> 00:09:42.843
How's that sound?
Until then,

199
00:09:42.930 --> 00:09:44.888
I want you
to keep that chiseled chin up.

200
00:09:45.019 --> 00:09:47.151
You hear me, handsome pants?

201
00:09:47.282 --> 00:09:48.762
Shakira says hi!

202
00:09:59.686 --> 00:10:01.296
There you go, Rae,
the first Winter Mint

203
00:10:01.426 --> 00:10:03.951
Choco Fantasia drink
of the season.

204
00:10:04.038 --> 00:10:06.518
Thank you. My favorite.

205
00:10:06.606 --> 00:10:08.303
Mmm.

206
00:10:08.433 --> 00:10:09.826
Heaven.

207
00:10:09.957 --> 00:10:11.412
How come we only
make these at Christmas time?

208
00:10:11.436 --> 00:10:12.916
Well, because nobody
but you likes it.

209
00:10:15.092 --> 00:10:17.138
- Miss H.
- Hey, Junior.

210
00:10:17.268 --> 00:10:19.270
What's up, buddy?
I got some news.

211
00:10:19.357 --> 00:10:21.446
Uh, uh. Let me guess.

212
00:10:21.577 --> 00:10:23.337
You've been practicing
that shuffle step combination

213
00:10:23.361 --> 00:10:24.667
for the recital, right?

214
00:10:24.754 --> 00:10:27.322
Well, there's
a shuffle step in it.

215
00:10:27.452 --> 00:10:28.628
Mm-hmm.

216
00:10:28.758 --> 00:10:30.847
It's another dance
for your followers.

217
00:10:34.503 --> 00:10:37.071
Okay.

218
00:10:37.158 --> 00:10:37.898
But how about you start
working on the show

219
00:10:38.028 --> 00:10:39.943
that you're actually in.

220
00:10:40.074 --> 00:10:41.162
Smash that subscribe button.

221
00:10:41.249 --> 00:10:43.599
More hits, more followers,
more peeps

222
00:10:43.730 --> 00:10:45.296
coming to this show
to see all of us.

223
00:10:45.383 --> 00:10:46.907
I'm telling you, it's a win-win.

224
00:10:46.994 --> 00:10:48.434
The recital's
in less than two weeks.

225
00:10:48.517 --> 00:10:50.737
I need all hands on deck.
So I hope you're ready.

226
00:10:50.867 --> 00:10:52.913
I was born ready.
But that wasn't my news.

227
00:10:53.043 --> 00:10:54.175
Here's my news.

228
00:10:54.305 --> 00:10:56.656
My tío's coming in time
for the show.

229
00:10:56.786 --> 00:10:58.745
And he's gonna stay
for Christmas.

230
00:10:58.832 --> 00:11:00.331
Billy Holiday
is coming back to Garnet?

231
00:11:00.355 --> 00:11:02.009
Ooh.

232
00:11:02.096 --> 00:11:05.621
Yeah, okay, I will add him
to the list of VIP seats.

233
00:11:05.752 --> 00:11:06.859
Yeah, we just heard
that he got...

234
00:11:06.883 --> 00:11:08.580
Uh, it's been a while
since your uncle's

235
00:11:08.668 --> 00:11:10.191
been back in town, right?

236
00:11:10.278 --> 00:11:12.584
Yup, he's always busy
doing his Christmas special.

237
00:11:12.715 --> 00:11:13.455
But not this year.

238
00:11:13.585 --> 00:11:14.935
He's on his way here right now.

239
00:11:15.022 --> 00:11:16.414
It's going to be
a great Christmas.

240
00:11:16.545 --> 00:11:17.720
I can already feel it.

241
00:11:30.602 --> 00:11:33.649
Ah, my own personal valet.

242
00:11:33.736 --> 00:11:35.825
To what do I owe the pleasure?

243
00:11:35.912 --> 00:11:37.697
I work for the city.

244
00:11:37.784 --> 00:11:39.109
Just trying to make sure
to keep the riffraff

245
00:11:39.133 --> 00:11:40.917
like you off the streets.

246
00:11:41.004 --> 00:11:41.918
Hey, where's the car at?

247
00:11:42.005 --> 00:11:43.093
This ain't LA.

248
00:11:43.180 --> 00:11:44.573
I walked here.
We're walking home.

249
00:11:44.704 --> 00:11:45.768
Let me get that.
I can carry that.

250
00:11:45.792 --> 00:11:47.097
Oh.
Did you want this?

251
00:11:47.228 --> 00:11:50.405
Here. There you go.

252
00:11:50.535 --> 00:11:53.060
Oh, God! Oh, hey!
Ow! Watch the wig!

253
00:11:53.190 --> 00:11:55.018
Watch the hair...
All right, tap, tap.

254
00:11:57.717 --> 00:12:00.154
Good to have you home,
little brother.

255
00:12:00.284 --> 00:12:02.199
Things never change.

256
00:12:02.330 --> 00:12:04.027
It's good to see you.

257
00:12:04.158 --> 00:12:05.725
You know, Junior missed you.

258
00:12:05.855 --> 00:12:09.076
Mom too.
Not me, you know, I'm fine.

259
00:12:09.163 --> 00:12:13.036
Hey, you okay talking
about the thing?

260
00:12:13.123 --> 00:12:14.403
It's okay.
You can talk about it.

261
00:12:14.429 --> 00:12:17.693
Okay, 'cause everybody
was talking about it.

262
00:12:17.824 --> 00:12:19.105
You know, they're
taking applications

263
00:12:19.129 --> 00:12:20.391
down at the firehouse.

264
00:12:20.522 --> 00:12:22.263
I'm senior EMT these days,

265
00:12:22.350 --> 00:12:24.308
and don't know how dire

266
00:12:24.439 --> 00:12:27.398
your situation is,
but just know I got pull.

267
00:12:27.529 --> 00:12:28.878
Thank you, Marissa, but...

268
00:12:29.009 --> 00:12:31.446
I think I'm gonna
lay low for a while.

269
00:12:31.576 --> 00:12:32.926
You sure?

270
00:12:33.013 --> 00:12:36.320
I mean, Laying low
was never your thing.

271
00:12:36.407 --> 00:12:39.323
Well, maybe it's time I learned.

272
00:12:39.454 --> 00:12:40.977
Feels good to be home.

273
00:12:41.108 --> 00:12:43.632
Oh, Junior is gonna be
so excited to see you.

274
00:12:43.763 --> 00:12:45.286
Me too.

275
00:12:45.373 --> 00:12:46.480
Now, give me that bag.
We've got to pick up the pace.

276
00:12:46.504 --> 00:12:49.681
Mom's got some cookies for me.

277
00:12:49.769 --> 00:12:50.769
All right.

278
00:12:53.033 --> 00:12:55.078

Let me see that smile,
baby girl.

284
00:13:02.956 --> 00:13:04.479
And left.

285
00:13:04.566 --> 00:13:06.133
All right.

286
00:13:07.612 --> 00:13:09.397
Good.

287

All right, girls,
here's what we're gonna, okay?

299
00:13:43.997 --> 00:13:45.302

Hey.

303
00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:12.547
Take five, guys.

304
00:14:12.677 --> 00:14:14.636
- Hey!
- Tío, I knew you'd come!

305
00:14:14.723 --> 00:14:16.083
Hey, Mom.
You look good in there,

306
00:14:16.116 --> 00:14:17.595
buddy, nice, man.

307
00:14:17.682 --> 00:14:19.684
- So good to see you.
- It's good to see you too.

308
00:14:19.815 --> 00:14:21.095
This is my dance teacher,
Miss H.

309
00:14:21.208 --> 00:14:23.384
Miss H, this is Tío.

310
00:14:23.514 --> 00:14:25.386
Well, I'm not Tío.

311
00:14:25.516 --> 00:14:28.215
I mean, I'm... I'm his tío,
but... it's Billy.

312
00:14:28.302 --> 00:14:30.695
Hi. Rae.

313
00:14:30.826 --> 00:14:32.393
We've actually met before.

314
00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:34.264
My mom used to run
this dance studio.

315
00:14:34.351 --> 00:14:36.440
- Oh, Miss Tilly is your mom?
- Yeah.

316
00:14:36.527 --> 00:14:39.356
Oh, that's right, and you
had a sister too, right?

317
00:14:39.487 --> 00:14:42.272
I still do.

318
00:14:42.359 --> 00:14:43.679
Uh, but yeah,
when my mom retired,

319
00:14:43.795 --> 00:14:45.754
I took over the studio.

320
00:14:45.841 --> 00:14:47.582
Nice, nice, and now my nephew

321
00:14:47.712 --> 00:14:49.714
is taking dance
at the same place I did.

322
00:14:49.845 --> 00:14:52.326
Yeah, but I'm bringing moves
you never seen before.

323
00:14:52.413 --> 00:14:53.588
Okay, okay.

324
00:14:53.675 --> 00:14:55.807
Well, dance does run
in our family.

325
00:14:55.895 --> 00:14:58.158
Oh, look out.
Don't hurt 'em.

326
00:14:58.245 --> 00:14:59.507
Ha, still got it.

327
00:14:59.594 --> 00:15:00.508
Let's hope it's not contagious.

328
00:15:00.595 --> 00:15:01.944
Hey.

329
00:15:02.031 --> 00:15:04.512
You guys are
a very talented family.

330
00:15:04.642 --> 00:15:06.762
Hey, thank you for putting
away the props after class.

331
00:15:06.818 --> 00:15:07.994
But I didn't.

332
00:15:08.124 --> 00:15:10.257
I know. You can now.

333
00:15:10.387 --> 00:15:12.365
When you're famous, people
do stuff like that for you.

334
00:15:12.389 --> 00:15:13.389
Right, Tío?

335
00:15:13.434 --> 00:15:14.739
Go.

336
00:15:14.870 --> 00:15:16.828
I got over 100 views
on my last post.

337
00:15:16.959 --> 00:15:17.960
I'm fame adjacent.

338
00:15:18.091 --> 00:15:20.180
Okay.

339
00:15:20.267 --> 00:15:21.374
Hey, how's everything
with school going?

340
00:15:21.398 --> 00:15:23.444
Oh, he's got one more test,
you know.

341
00:15:23.531 --> 00:15:24.880
Winter break's this week,

342
00:15:24.967 --> 00:15:26.466
and I do have a call
in a couple of days

343
00:15:26.490 --> 00:15:29.015
to just check his progress
for the semester.

344
00:15:29.145 --> 00:15:29.841
Okay, well, if there's
anything I can do to help,

345
00:15:29.972 --> 00:15:31.147
please just let me know.

346
00:15:31.234 --> 00:15:32.844
If he needs some
extra study time,

347
00:15:32.975 --> 00:15:34.716
I can always cut back
on rehearsals for him.

348
00:15:34.846 --> 00:15:37.371
Wait, is Junior not doing
too well in school right now?

349
00:15:37.501 --> 00:15:40.026
It's just that, you know,
he's more motivated to become

350
00:15:40.156 --> 00:15:42.680
famous and less concerned
about what might happen

351
00:15:42.811 --> 00:15:45.292
if his dream doesn't pan out.

352
00:15:45.379 --> 00:15:47.381
Hey, come here a sec.

353
00:15:47.511 --> 00:15:50.253
Listen, let me be
a cautionary tale, all right?

354
00:15:50.384 --> 00:15:52.125
You always gotta have a plan B.

355
00:15:52.255 --> 00:15:54.997
Both: Balance on stage,
balance in life.

356
00:16:00.220 --> 00:16:01.525
That's my next class.

357
00:16:01.612 --> 00:16:04.702
I'm... I'm... I'm sure I'll be
seeing you around.

358
00:16:04.833 --> 00:16:06.376
Yeah, and hey,
if you ever want to come by

359
00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:09.446
and watch Junior practice,
feel free.

360
00:16:09.533 --> 00:16:11.318
Thanks, I may take you up
on that.

361
00:16:11.448 --> 00:16:12.449
Okay.

362
00:16:12.536 --> 00:16:14.843
Bye.

363
00:16:14.974 --> 00:16:16.671
Hey, girls.

364
00:16:16.801 --> 00:16:18.673
I'm... I'm sure I'll see
you around.

365
00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:21.458
I missed you.

366
00:16:21.545 --> 00:16:22.696
- Me too, buddy.
- Come on, let's go.

367
00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:24.548
- Can you get the bag?
- Yeah.

368
00:16:24.679 --> 00:16:26.028
All right, let's go.

369
00:16:35.081 --> 00:16:37.257
You look tired and hungry.

370
00:16:37.387 --> 00:16:39.999
Why's your hair so flat, mijo?

371
00:16:40.086 --> 00:16:41.739
You're right, Mom,
I am tired and hungry.

372
00:16:41.826 --> 00:16:44.264
I gave my hair the day off.

373
00:16:44.394 --> 00:16:45.787
Hey, Ma.

374
00:16:45.874 --> 00:16:48.529
Billy's fine talking
about being canned.

375
00:16:48.659 --> 00:16:50.400
Oh, great.

376
00:16:50.531 --> 00:16:53.534
Did she tell you about the
job opening at the firehouse?

377
00:16:53.621 --> 00:16:55.623
Yeah, she did, but...

378
00:16:55.753 --> 00:16:58.278
Oh, it could be so much fun.

379
00:16:58.365 --> 00:17:01.977
You slide down poles
and hang off trucks.

380
00:17:02.064 --> 00:17:03.065
Way to sell it, Mom.

381
00:17:06.329 --> 00:17:09.245
You slide down poles.

382
00:17:09.332 --> 00:17:13.293
Um, so what's the deal
with Joanna?

383
00:17:13.380 --> 00:17:15.121
Any chance things
might rekindle?

384
00:17:15.251 --> 00:17:18.298
No, no. No, no, no.

385
00:17:18.428 --> 00:17:20.468
Never thought she'd end up
with custody of the show.

386
00:17:20.517 --> 00:17:21.953
Yeah.

387
00:17:22.041 --> 00:17:24.130
Anyway, enough about me.
How you doing, Marissa?

388
00:17:24.217 --> 00:17:27.002
Oh, we're good, I'm good.

389
00:17:27.089 --> 00:17:29.874
Y'know, Mom still watches
Junior when I work late nights.

390
00:17:30.005 --> 00:17:33.791
Still single as ever,
so that's fun.

391
00:17:33.922 --> 00:17:34.662
But, uh... well, you know,
we come over for dinner

392
00:17:34.792 --> 00:17:36.229
as often as we can.

393
00:17:36.316 --> 00:17:38.405
Well, she is a much
better cook than you.

394
00:17:38.492 --> 00:17:40.276
Uh, she's a better cook
than anyone.

395
00:17:40.407 --> 00:17:41.799
True.

396
00:17:41.886 --> 00:17:46.108
Oh, um, did she tell you
her Christmas wish?

397
00:17:46.195 --> 00:17:50.634
Oh, well, my Christmas wish
is for all of you to stay here

398
00:17:50.721 --> 00:17:53.594
in my house
for the whole holiday.

399
00:17:53.724 --> 00:17:57.032
So I sleep on the couch
and Marissa...

400
00:17:57.163 --> 00:17:59.600
No, you and Marissa
have your old room,

401
00:17:59.687 --> 00:18:02.255
Junior takes the guest room.

402
00:18:02.385 --> 00:18:05.084
I'm not sharing our old room
with my grown-up sister.

403
00:18:05.171 --> 00:18:07.477
We're too old for that.
No, you are not.

404
00:18:07.564 --> 00:18:12.917
My house, my rules,
my Christmas wish.

405
00:18:13.004 --> 00:18:14.789
I already tried, bro.

406
00:18:24.799 --> 00:18:26.472
Wow, we haven't shared
a room since I was...

407
00:18:26.496 --> 00:18:28.498
Oh, this age?

408
00:18:28.585 --> 00:18:30.805
Hey, wrestle you for the bed
closest the bathroom.

409
00:18:33.024 --> 00:18:34.461
No, I'm good.

410
00:18:34.591 --> 00:18:35.829
I don't feel like getting
choked out right now.

411
00:18:35.853 --> 00:18:38.029
What, Hollywood made you soft?

412
00:18:40.119 --> 00:18:42.164
Oh, one sec.

413
00:18:51.347 --> 00:18:52.479
Don't you need to study?

414
00:18:52.609 --> 00:18:53.828
I will.

415
00:18:53.958 --> 00:18:55.917
I just want
to post this real quick.

416
00:18:56.047 --> 00:18:58.224
Dancers need to be smart too.

417
00:18:58.354 --> 00:19:01.052
Nana, dancers don't
even go to college.

418
00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:03.229
Ah, not true.
One of the best dancers ever,

419
00:19:03.359 --> 00:19:05.318
Gene Kelly, graduated
with a degree in economics

420
00:19:05.448 --> 00:19:06.512
from the University
of Pittsburgh.

421
00:19:06.536 --> 00:19:08.059
Fine. Hey, Tío.

422
00:19:08.147 --> 00:19:09.322
My handle is JSteps.

423
00:19:09.409 --> 00:19:11.672
Check the link to my bio
on my profile.

424
00:19:11.759 --> 00:19:13.630
You're 12,
how long a bio could it be?

425
00:19:13.717 --> 00:19:15.241
180 characters.

426
00:19:15.371 --> 00:19:18.679
Got to be all about
that content, tú sabes.

427
00:19:18.809 --> 00:19:20.115
When Miss H takes us
to New York,

428
00:19:20.246 --> 00:19:22.378
I'ma do a dance in Times
Square that will blow up.

429
00:19:22.509 --> 00:19:23.858
New York.

430
00:19:23.988 --> 00:19:25.642
That's right...
All of our money from our

431
00:19:25.773 --> 00:19:27.707
recital is going towards
Miss H. taking us to Broadway.

432
00:19:27.731 --> 00:19:30.604
She wants us to experience what
she felt when she danced there.

433
00:19:30.691 --> 00:19:31.866
She danced on Broadway?

434
00:19:31.996 --> 00:19:33.520
- Mm-hmm.
- Nice.

435
00:19:33.607 --> 00:19:36.087
But till then, study.

436
00:19:36.218 --> 00:19:37.045
Oh, no, no, no.
I didn't finish my TikTok!

437
00:19:37.176 --> 00:19:39.090
Come on, no!

438
00:19:46.533 --> 00:19:47.142
I think I'm gonna need
to move the recital

439
00:19:47.229 --> 00:19:48.709
to a bigger space.

440
00:19:48.839 --> 00:19:50.363
Maybe that'll
sell some more tickets.

441
00:19:50.493 --> 00:19:51.799
Move it from the studio?

442
00:19:51.886 --> 00:19:54.062
Maybe. I gotta think
of something, though.

443
00:19:54.193 --> 00:19:55.561
Maybe you should ask
Mr. Holiday if he

444
00:19:55.585 --> 00:19:57.196
has a spare Hollywood studio.

445
00:19:57.326 --> 00:19:59.981
Yeah, if only.

446
00:20:00.068 --> 00:20:01.330
I saw him today.

447
00:20:01.461 --> 00:20:03.419
He came by to see Junior
at the studio.

448
00:20:03.550 --> 00:20:04.855
Really?

449
00:20:04.942 --> 00:20:06.683
Was he snobby? Plastic?

450
00:20:06.770 --> 00:20:08.424
I bet those dimples are fake.

451
00:20:08.555 --> 00:20:10.774
You can't fake dimples, Pheebs.

452
00:20:10.861 --> 00:20:13.690
But no, he was, uh,

453
00:20:13.777 --> 00:20:16.780
he was genuine, kind.

454
00:20:16.867 --> 00:20:18.695
No.

455
00:20:18.782 --> 00:20:20.412
First of all, those dimples
are only in town for two weeks.

456
00:20:20.436 --> 00:20:22.786
Second of all, I probably
won't even see him again.

457
00:20:22.873 --> 00:20:25.093
I'm sure he's busy
doing family stuff.

458
00:20:25.224 --> 00:20:29.315
Yeah, but everyone's got to eat.

459
00:20:29.445 --> 00:20:31.404
Hi, takeout order
for Hernandez, please.

460
00:20:31.534 --> 00:20:33.754
- Almost ready.
- Really? No warning?

461
00:20:35.756 --> 00:20:37.366
Hello again.

462
00:20:37.453 --> 00:20:38.453
Hi.

463
00:20:41.457 --> 00:20:43.242
Rae's Egg and Onion.

464
00:20:43.372 --> 00:20:45.983
Rae's Rueben.
Rae's Bread Pudding.

465
00:20:46.114 --> 00:20:47.898
Lemme guess, this your diner?

466
00:20:48.029 --> 00:20:50.553
No, it's mine. I own it.

467
00:20:50.684 --> 00:20:52.599
That's my sister Phoebe.

468
00:20:52.729 --> 00:20:54.514
Nice to meet you,
Mr. Hollywood.

469
00:20:54.601 --> 00:20:58.039
It's Mr. Holiday,
but nice to meet you too.

470
00:20:58.126 --> 00:21:00.128
I like what you've done
with the place.

471
00:21:00.215 --> 00:21:02.173
What was this before,
a laundromat?

472
00:21:02.304 --> 00:21:03.610
No, it was the gas station.

473
00:21:03.740 --> 00:21:06.047
Oh, that's right.
Oh, man, how did I forget?

474
00:21:06.177 --> 00:21:07.266
I'm sure it's easy to forget

475
00:21:07.396 --> 00:21:08.678
when you've been gone
for so long.

476
00:21:08.702 --> 00:21:10.921
You know, I was gone
for five years,

477
00:21:11.008 --> 00:21:13.073
and even then, when I came
back, it felt so different.

478
00:21:16.797 --> 00:21:18.557
Oh, yeah, Junior said
something about Broadway?

479
00:21:18.581 --> 00:21:20.366
I'm gonna go
check on your order.

480
00:21:20.453 --> 00:21:23.412
Hernandez, dinner for four.

481
00:21:23.499 --> 00:21:27.242
Yeah, I was a dancer
in New York for a while.

482
00:21:27.329 --> 00:21:29.331
The moment I went
and stood in Times Square

483
00:21:29.418 --> 00:21:31.507
and was able to see
those dancers on stage,

484
00:21:31.594 --> 00:21:34.423
I was hooked.

485
00:21:34.554 --> 00:21:36.599
Yep. The dancing bug.

486
00:21:36.686 --> 00:21:38.949
Once it gets in your blood,
you're in it for life.

487
00:21:39.036 --> 00:21:40.777
Yeah.

488
00:21:40.864 --> 00:21:41.864
So why'd you leave?

489
00:21:44.128 --> 00:21:45.928
Hurry home before it
gets cold, Mr. Hollywood.

490
00:21:48.132 --> 00:21:50.961
Story for another time.

491
00:21:51.048 --> 00:21:54.269
I look forward to it.

492
00:21:54.356 --> 00:21:58.273
<i>Hey, it's Joanna Garagiola,
and I want to remind you guys</i>

493
00:21:58.360 --> 00:22:02.538
<i>to please tune in to the best
Christmas special ever.</i>

494
00:22:02.625 --> 00:22:06.542
<i>I promise it is
going to be holiday-licious.</i>

495
00:22:06.673 --> 00:22:09.719
Yeah, I'm gonna be
skipping that this year.

496
00:22:09.806 --> 00:22:11.697
By the way, I may take you up
on that visit to dance studio.

497
00:22:11.721 --> 00:22:14.115
Yeah, anytime.

498
00:22:14.245 --> 00:22:16.030
Hey, Billy.
Yeah?

499
00:22:18.075 --> 00:22:19.555
Don't forget your food.

500
00:22:23.820 --> 00:22:25.039
Thanks.

501
00:22:29.696 --> 00:22:32.263
Don't.

502
00:22:32.394 --> 00:22:33.656
I didn't say anything.

503
00:22:47.191 --> 00:22:49.498
I like being back home, Mom.

504
00:22:49.585 --> 00:22:52.240
The town may feel different,
but the people,

505
00:22:52.327 --> 00:22:54.155
they feel the same.

506
00:22:54.242 --> 00:22:56.200
Ah, the old Christmas tree farm.

507
00:23:02.076 --> 00:23:04.339
I'm always here for you, Guillermo.

508
00:23:04.426 --> 00:23:05.993
Except when I'm in yoga class.

509
00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:08.952
Downward dog takes a quick
minute for me to get back up.

510
00:23:11.128 --> 00:23:13.087
Thanks for the visual, Mom.

511
00:23:13.174 --> 00:23:14.654
Let's find us a tree.

512
00:23:20.050 --> 00:23:22.096
You remember that Christmas Eve
barn shows, Mom?

513
00:23:22.183 --> 00:23:23.813
With the big red curtain
and that gold tassel?

514
00:23:23.837 --> 00:23:25.316
Oh, yes!

515
00:23:25.404 --> 00:23:29.582
One of the greatest
Garnet holiday traditions.

516
00:23:29.669 --> 00:23:32.802
You know, they stopped
doing that show a while ago.

517
00:23:32.889 --> 00:23:35.109
From the looks of it,

518
00:23:35.196 --> 00:23:38.504
that's the last time
this barn got any love.

519
00:23:38.591 --> 00:23:40.311
Definitely looks like
it's seen better days.

520
00:23:40.375 --> 00:23:43.160
Well, at least we have
the memories.

521
00:23:43.291 --> 00:23:44.814
Hey, come on.

522
00:23:44.945 --> 00:23:48.383
<i>♪ Peace and joy
around the world ♪</i>

523
00:23:48.470 --> 00:23:51.299
<i>♪ For every boy and girl ♪</i>

524
00:23:51.430 --> 00:23:53.257
All right.

00:23:53.344 --> 00:23:55.521
<i>♪ Turn on the lights ♪</i>

526
00:23:55.651 --> 00:23:58.306

They're good.

530
00:24:06.314 --> 00:24:08.577

Hey!

534
00:24:14.453 --> 00:24:15.628
Okay.

535
00:24:15.715 --> 00:24:16.977
Thank you.

536
00:24:17.107 --> 00:24:17.978
So that was a little preview

537
00:24:18.108 --> 00:24:19.501
of our holiday dance recital.

538
00:24:19.632 --> 00:24:22.417
Now this show is free,
but donations

539
00:24:22.548 --> 00:24:24.593
are strongly appreciated.

540
00:24:24.680 --> 00:24:25.918
We've got a long way
to get these kids

541
00:24:25.942 --> 00:24:28.162
to New York,
so every little bit helps.

542
00:24:30.599 --> 00:24:32.862
Hey, that was smooth, Jun, nice.

543
00:24:32.949 --> 00:24:34.229
Thanks for coming, Tío, Grandma.

544
00:24:34.342 --> 00:24:36.866
But if she let me
do my JSteps originals,

545
00:24:36.997 --> 00:24:38.496
we'd need buckets
to take in that cash haul.

546
00:24:38.520 --> 00:24:40.870
Hey, Junior.

547
00:24:40.957 --> 00:24:44.004
I'll see you later, Tío.

548
00:24:44.134 --> 00:24:46.702
- Hi.
- Ah, we meet again.

549
00:24:46.789 --> 00:24:47.616
Hey, I got a mani-pedi at three,

550
00:24:47.747 --> 00:24:49.488
should I expect you there?

551
00:24:49.575 --> 00:24:51.402
My claws are a little ragged.

552
00:24:51.490 --> 00:24:52.684
Hey, you know my mom?
Of course.

553
00:24:52.708 --> 00:24:53.970
Everyone knows your mom.

554
00:24:54.057 --> 00:24:57.365
- I'm Garnet famous, mijo.
- Excuse me.

555
00:24:59.672 --> 00:25:01.978
So you're taking the kids
to New York, huh?

556
00:25:02.109 --> 00:25:04.546
Yeah, I'm trying.

557
00:25:04.677 --> 00:25:06.679
I don't like to live
with "what if's."

558
00:25:06.809 --> 00:25:07.873
- "What if's."
- Yeah, you know,

559
00:25:07.897 --> 00:25:09.116
what if I went for it?

560
00:25:09.246 --> 00:25:10.378
What if I really tried?

561
00:25:10.509 --> 00:25:13.424
You know, what if...
I get it.

562
00:25:13.512 --> 00:25:15.775
That's cool.

563
00:25:15.862 --> 00:25:16.969
So I was just asking my mom,

564
00:25:16.993 --> 00:25:18.386
what's the deal
with the old barn?

565
00:25:18.473 --> 00:25:20.127
Well, let me tell you.

566
00:25:22.172 --> 00:25:24.087
They used to do
the Christmas show

567
00:25:24.218 --> 00:25:25.848
back in the day in there.
You remember that.

568
00:25:25.872 --> 00:25:27.961
Oh, of course.
I was in a few of 'em.

569
00:25:28.048 --> 00:25:29.678
My senior year in high school,
I did a solo

570
00:25:29.702 --> 00:25:31.617
that your mom
choreographed for me.

571
00:25:31.747 --> 00:25:33.333
Oh, I know that
because three years later,

572
00:25:33.357 --> 00:25:35.142
I stole your dance.
Oh!

573
00:25:35.229 --> 00:25:37.666
But at some point,
the barn became unsafe,

574
00:25:37.753 --> 00:25:39.538
and they stopped doing shows.

575
00:25:39.668 --> 00:25:40.495
I heard there's a bunch of props

576
00:25:40.582 --> 00:25:41.820
and costumes back there, though.

577
00:25:41.844 --> 00:25:44.151
Buried like treasure.
Really?

578
00:25:44.281 --> 00:25:48.503
Yeah, just no one's brave
enough to dig them out.

579
00:25:48.590 --> 00:25:50.461
I heard you say you're not
where you want to be

580
00:25:50.592 --> 00:25:53.160
with donations
and recital tickets.

581
00:25:53.290 --> 00:25:54.857
Yeah, that's true.

582
00:25:54.944 --> 00:25:59.645
Well, then maybe we shouldn't
be afraid of an old barn.

583
00:25:59.732 --> 00:26:01.995
Just a thought, but what if
you updated the recital a bit

584
00:26:02.082 --> 00:26:04.954
and incorporated the past more?

585
00:26:05.085 --> 00:26:07.304
Maybe I'm off here,
but there's something that's

586
00:26:07.435 --> 00:26:10.220
still intriguing
about this old barn, right?

587
00:26:10.307 --> 00:26:12.614
There's something unsafe
and decrepit about the barn,

588
00:26:12.745 --> 00:26:17.053
but, um, sure.
What are you thinking?

589
00:26:17.140 --> 00:26:19.316
I don't know yet, but...

590
00:26:19.403 --> 00:26:22.058
let me sleep on it
and let it marinate.

591
00:26:22.145 --> 00:26:24.495
Catch up tomorrow?

592
00:26:24.626 --> 00:26:26.672
Marinate away.

593
00:26:39.815 --> 00:26:41.687
Guillermo!

594
00:26:44.515 --> 00:26:46.169
- Thanks, Mom.
- Mm-hmm.

595
00:26:49.825 --> 00:26:51.479
Oh, my God.

596
00:26:51.566 --> 00:26:52.566
My first tap shoes.

597
00:26:52.654 --> 00:26:54.613
You kept 'em?

598
00:26:54.700 --> 00:26:56.440
A good mom saves
almost everything.

599
00:26:56.571 --> 00:26:58.791
I wanted to show them to you.

600
00:26:58.878 --> 00:27:00.009
And this...

601
00:27:03.796 --> 00:27:05.536
You see that smile?

602
00:27:05.624 --> 00:27:07.887
Your dad was bursting
with happy.

603
00:27:07.974 --> 00:27:10.150
So proud.

604
00:27:10.280 --> 00:27:12.282
It was after your first
dance recital

605
00:27:12.413 --> 00:27:14.676
at the old barn Christmas show.

606
00:27:14.807 --> 00:27:16.722
Wow.

607
00:27:16.809 --> 00:27:19.289
Oh, mijo.

608
00:27:19.376 --> 00:27:22.858
Watching you dance
was so wonderful.

609
00:27:22.989 --> 00:27:27.428
And the joy it brought you.
Dad and I loved it.

610
00:27:27.558 --> 00:27:28.908
Yeah, I loved it too.

611
00:27:32.476 --> 00:27:34.827
Really miss him
this time of year.

612
00:27:34.914 --> 00:27:37.481
Me too, mijo.

613
00:27:37.568 --> 00:27:39.396
Me too.

614
00:27:39.483 --> 00:27:42.748
But you know,
it is never too late

615
00:27:42.878 --> 00:27:44.053
to pick up an old habit.

616
00:27:44.140 --> 00:27:48.667
Come on. Come on, mijo.

621
00:28:00.156 --> 00:28:02.681
Hey, what's up, little man?

622
00:28:02.768 --> 00:28:04.944
Tío, seriously?
You ruined a perfect take.

623
00:28:05.031 --> 00:28:07.381
So make the next take
better than perfect.

624
00:28:07.511 --> 00:28:08.817
What part of your geography exam

625
00:28:08.904 --> 00:28:10.950
involves doing the renegade
and the dolphin?

626
00:28:11.080 --> 00:28:12.865
When I'm famous like you,
I can hire someone

627
00:28:12.995 --> 00:28:14.355
to tell me where
the countries are.

628
00:28:14.431 --> 00:28:15.582
But if you're not famous,
it might be a good idea

629
00:28:15.606 --> 00:28:17.130
to know where Pacoima is.

630
00:28:17.217 --> 00:28:18.871
What's a Pacoima?

631
00:28:18.958 --> 00:28:20.849
It's a nice little city
right outside of LA that needs

632
00:28:20.873 --> 00:28:23.179
a grand marshal
for the Christmas parade.

633
00:28:23.266 --> 00:28:25.312
So now that I know what
a Pacoima is,

634
00:28:25.399 --> 00:28:26.922
can I get back to it?

635
00:28:27.053 --> 00:28:29.446
Look, my point is,
do your homework

636
00:28:29.533 --> 00:28:31.622
or Pacoima is
not gonna want you.

637
00:28:31.753 --> 00:28:32.861
There's gonna be time
for all this later.

638
00:28:32.885 --> 00:28:33.885
Believe me.

639
00:28:35.626 --> 00:28:38.412
Hey, Junior, how's the studying?

640
00:28:41.589 --> 00:28:44.635
Good. It's going good.

641
00:28:44.723 --> 00:28:45.636
All right.

642
00:28:56.125 --> 00:28:58.127
- Ah, thanks.
- Wait, wait, wait.

643
00:28:58.214 --> 00:28:59.322
I can't, Pheebs,
I had to schedule

644
00:28:59.346 --> 00:29:00.802
extra rehearsals today
for the recital.

645
00:29:00.826 --> 00:29:02.610
You know this is my crazy time.

646
00:29:02.741 --> 00:29:04.066
So you want me
to throw away your very

647
00:29:04.090 --> 00:29:06.527
favorite special shake
that I made for you?

648
00:29:06.614 --> 00:29:08.747
Okay, okay,
I can take just a few minutes.

649
00:29:11.619 --> 00:29:12.794
Thank you.

650
00:29:12.881 --> 00:29:16.015
So tell me about the bake sale.

651
00:29:16.145 --> 00:29:18.234
It was really good.
We sold a bunch of stuff,

652
00:29:18.321 --> 00:29:19.496
especially your pies.

653
00:29:19.627 --> 00:29:21.977
The kids are doing great
at their dances.

654
00:29:22.108 --> 00:29:23.674
Billy Holiday was there.
Um, thank you,

655
00:29:23.805 --> 00:29:26.721
by the way, for the...
Wait, go back.

656
00:29:26.852 --> 00:29:30.029
- We sold a lot of your pies?
- No, the Mr. Holiday part.

657
00:29:30.159 --> 00:29:32.205
What was he doing there?

658
00:29:32.292 --> 00:29:34.860
I don't know, probably
supporting his nephew

659
00:29:34.947 --> 00:29:37.993
who was dancing
in the show and buying a tree?

660
00:29:38.080 --> 00:29:39.647
He didn't have any other agenda?

661
00:29:39.734 --> 00:29:41.407
Phoebe, please don't make
something out of nothing.

662
00:29:41.431 --> 00:29:44.347
Okay, look, he is very nice.

663
00:29:44.434 --> 00:29:47.394
It's just not on my radar.

664
00:29:47.481 --> 00:29:49.526
But he did say something, though,

665
00:29:49.613 --> 00:29:52.355
about the recital and not
being afraid of the old barn.

666
00:29:52.442 --> 00:29:53.835
What?

667
00:29:53.922 --> 00:29:56.098
He said he wanted
to talk about later.

668
00:29:56.229 --> 00:29:58.187
I think later has come.

669
00:29:58.274 --> 00:29:59.885
What?

670
00:30:03.192 --> 00:30:05.499
Uh... I'll have
what she's having, please.

671
00:30:05.629 --> 00:30:06.650
How do you know you'll like it?

672
00:30:06.674 --> 00:30:08.154
'Cause you won't.

673
00:30:08.241 --> 00:30:10.591
Let's just say I'm adventurous.

674
00:30:10.721 --> 00:30:12.549
One Winter Mint
Choco Fantasia drink

675
00:30:12.680 --> 00:30:13.550
coming right up.

676
00:30:16.466 --> 00:30:19.382
Enjoy.
Thank you

677
00:30:23.865 --> 00:30:24.865
So did you, uh,

678
00:30:24.953 --> 00:30:27.086
dream about that creaky barn?

679
00:30:27.173 --> 00:30:28.478
Kinda.

680
00:30:28.565 --> 00:30:30.741
You ready for my pitch?

681
00:30:30.829 --> 00:30:31.830
Hit me.

682
00:30:31.917 --> 00:30:32.961
Okay.

683
00:30:33.048 --> 00:30:35.050
So I think you should consider

684
00:30:35.137 --> 00:30:37.096
getting the community involved
in the recital.

685
00:30:37.183 --> 00:30:38.401
Yeah, I know.
I've been trying.

686
00:30:38.488 --> 00:30:39.750
We did the... the bake sale,

687
00:30:39.881 --> 00:30:41.467
and then we have the carwash
on Tuesday...

688
00:30:41.491 --> 00:30:44.190
No, no, no, no.
Yes, you've been doing great.

689
00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:48.498
I mean, more <i>involved</i> involved.

690
00:30:48.629 --> 00:30:50.718
When I was doing "Dance Off,"
I used to have a say-so

691
00:30:50.805 --> 00:30:53.416
on the props and the design
and the production,

692
00:30:53.503 --> 00:30:56.680
and it gave me a sense of pride
that I was a part of something.

693
00:30:56.767 --> 00:30:58.807
We don't really have
the same budget as "Dance Off."

694
00:30:58.857 --> 00:31:01.033
I know.
But you don't need to.

695
00:31:01.120 --> 00:31:03.185
Remember when we were talking
about the old barn shows

696
00:31:03.209 --> 00:31:04.950
and that Christmas feeling?

697
00:31:05.037 --> 00:31:06.342
Maybe that's what's missing.

698
00:31:06.429 --> 00:31:09.215
Well, you saw the barn,
it's a disaster.

699
00:31:09.302 --> 00:31:10.670
You said there was
a bunch of old props

700
00:31:10.694 --> 00:31:11.913
and costumes in there, right?

701
00:31:12.044 --> 00:31:14.002
Yeah, but they've
probably been eaten

702
00:31:14.133 --> 00:31:18.006
by who knows what,
or disintegrated into dust.

703
00:31:18.137 --> 00:31:20.400
I do like the idea, though,
of honoring the old tradition

704
00:31:20.487 --> 00:31:22.097
and giving it new life.

705
00:31:22.184 --> 00:31:24.491
So why don't we throw on
a couple hazmat suits,

706
00:31:24.621 --> 00:31:26.034
get in there, and then
we can make a decision?

707
00:31:26.058 --> 00:31:27.798
"We?"

708
00:31:27.929 --> 00:31:30.279
Well, being that
I'm recently unemployed,

709
00:31:30.410 --> 00:31:32.629
I do have some extra time
on my hands.

710
00:31:32.716 --> 00:31:33.911
And what kind of uncle
would I be

711
00:31:33.935 --> 00:31:37.286
if I didn't help my nephew
get to New York?

712
00:31:37.373 --> 00:31:39.158
I... I guess I could use the help.

713
00:31:41.856 --> 00:31:43.379
Oh.

714
00:31:43.466 --> 00:31:44.337
Sorry, I have rehearsal.

715
00:31:44.424 --> 00:31:46.208
Um...

716
00:31:46.295 --> 00:31:47.731
let's get started right away.

717
00:31:47.818 --> 00:31:51.039
When can you be at the barn
to figure things out?

718
00:31:51.170 --> 00:31:52.823
Tomorrow morning?

719
00:31:52.911 --> 00:31:55.261
Yeah. That's perfect.

720
00:31:55.348 --> 00:31:57.002
- Yeah. See you then.
- Bye.

721
00:32:03.486 --> 00:32:04.486
Yeah, I'm good.

722
00:32:13.627 --> 00:32:15.063
We're just gonna go to the barn

723
00:32:15.150 --> 00:32:17.030
and see if there's anything
that might help her.

724
00:32:20.416 --> 00:32:22.462
What? I didn't say anything.

725
00:32:22.549 --> 00:32:23.700
Even when you're not
saying anything,

726
00:32:23.724 --> 00:32:24.638
you're saying something.

727
00:32:24.725 --> 00:32:26.074
Well, I think it's great.

728
00:32:26.205 --> 00:32:28.033
And I know that Rae

729
00:32:28.120 --> 00:32:29.920
will be really excited
that you're gonna help.

730
00:32:29.991 --> 00:32:32.689
It's purely a work relationship.

731
00:32:34.865 --> 00:32:36.650
Percentages.

732
00:32:36.780 --> 00:32:38.086
Seriously, we're doing this?

733
00:32:38.173 --> 00:32:39.218
Yep, we're doing this.

734
00:32:39.348 --> 00:32:40.523
Gigi McIntosh...

735
00:32:40.610 --> 00:32:43.222
60% because you liked her,

736
00:32:43.352 --> 00:32:45.964
and 40% because you wanted
to go see Guns N' Roses

737
00:32:46.051 --> 00:32:48.053
and she had an extra ticket.

738
00:32:53.623 --> 00:32:56.104
80% because making shows
happen is what I do

739
00:32:56.235 --> 00:32:58.193
and 20% because Rae and I
have a lot in common.

740
00:32:58.280 --> 00:33:00.108
- Uh-huh.
- Uh-huh what?

741
00:33:00.195 --> 00:33:02.197
20% is not a lot.

742
00:33:02.328 --> 00:33:03.914
Try to tell me that
when I'm tipping at dinner.

743
00:33:03.938 --> 00:33:06.114
Percentages don't lie.

744
00:33:06.245 --> 00:33:07.526
What are the percentages
of you shutting up?

745
00:33:07.550 --> 00:33:10.162
Oh, you forget how well
I know you.

746
00:33:10.249 --> 00:33:11.902
Good night, little brother.

747
00:33:15.297 --> 00:33:17.691
It's strictly business!

748
00:33:28.702 --> 00:33:29.742
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

749
00:33:33.663 --> 00:33:35.839
Did you just change?

750
00:33:35.926 --> 00:33:38.799
'Cause you came in here
after teaching in dance gear.

751
00:33:38.929 --> 00:33:41.802
Well, yeah,
'cause I had just taught dance.

752
00:33:41.889 --> 00:33:45.762
And where are you going now?

753
00:33:45.849 --> 00:33:47.373
I am going to the... the old barn

754
00:33:47.460 --> 00:33:48.722
at the Christmas tree farm.

755
00:33:48.809 --> 00:33:50.550
What lucky old barn
to get to see your

756
00:33:50.680 --> 00:33:52.769
favorite Christmas sweater.

757
00:33:52.856 --> 00:33:54.443
Well, I'm... actually,
I'm meeting Billy there

758
00:33:54.467 --> 00:33:56.817
to discuss adding some elements
to the... to the show.

759
00:33:56.904 --> 00:33:58.601
Okay, there it is.

760
00:33:58.688 --> 00:34:00.473
No, there it isn't.

761
00:34:00.560 --> 00:34:01.909
You know what?

762
00:34:02.040 --> 00:34:03.911
Bye.

763
00:34:03.998 --> 00:34:05.652
Way too cute for the old barn,

764
00:34:05.739 --> 00:34:09.003
and way too cute
for Mr. Hollywood.

765
00:34:09.134 --> 00:34:10.352
It's Mr. Holiday!

766
00:34:25.150 --> 00:34:26.673
Hey.

767
00:34:26.803 --> 00:34:29.415
Hey. Oh, you look nice.

768
00:34:29.502 --> 00:34:31.088
I think I've only seen you
in dance clothes until now.

769
00:34:31.112 --> 00:34:32.983
Oh. Uh, thanks.

770
00:34:33.114 --> 00:34:34.352
I'm sure I'll be covered
from head to toe

771
00:34:34.376 --> 00:34:35.986
in dust in about five minutes.

772
00:34:36.074 --> 00:34:37.640
Right, the buried treasure.

773
00:34:37.727 --> 00:34:38.815
Shall we?

774
00:34:38.902 --> 00:34:39.902
Yeah.

775
00:34:43.342 --> 00:34:44.691
Oh, man,

776
00:34:44.821 --> 00:34:46.408
you weren't lying
about this place being dirty.

777
00:34:46.432 --> 00:34:48.216
Genius move to wear
the white shirt, huh?

778
00:34:48.347 --> 00:34:51.654
Well, I did warn you.

779
00:34:51.785 --> 00:34:53.787
Hey, remember these?

780
00:34:53.874 --> 00:34:55.658
Oh, yeah,
we should clean them up

781
00:34:55.745 --> 00:34:57.007
and use them for the show.

782
00:34:57.138 --> 00:34:59.749
I mean, I'd use all of this
if I could.

783
00:34:59.836 --> 00:35:01.490
Maybe not that.

784
00:35:01.577 --> 00:35:03.057
Yeah.

785
00:35:03.144 --> 00:35:05.190
We have to make sure not to be
just old school,

786
00:35:05.277 --> 00:35:07.322
'cause we're gonna have
parents, grandparents,

787
00:35:07.409 --> 00:35:09.716
and their social
media-obsessed kids.

788
00:35:09.803 --> 00:35:12.022
Yeah, a little ring-a-ding
with some bling.

789
00:35:12.153 --> 00:35:14.068
Christmas then, Christmas now.

790
00:35:14.199 --> 00:35:16.723
Ooh, that's good title.

791
00:35:16.853 --> 00:35:20.030
I always start with a phrase
or an image that inspires me.

792
00:35:20.161 --> 00:35:21.356
Last year
for the Christmas special,

793
00:35:21.380 --> 00:35:23.033
I started with this Sinatra

794
00:35:23.121 --> 00:35:25.732
sort of "Home for
the Holiday" vibe

795
00:35:27.603 --> 00:35:29.388
Ancient history now, though.

796
00:35:29.475 --> 00:35:30.675
Yeah, but now you're, you know,

797
00:35:30.780 --> 00:35:32.391
helping with the recital,
and in a way,

798
00:35:32.521 --> 00:35:36.960
we're kind of creating
our own holiday show, right?

799
00:35:37.047 --> 00:35:39.876
That's a good way to look at it.

800
00:35:40.007 --> 00:35:41.965
Hey, these are pretty cool,
by the way.

801
00:35:42.052 --> 00:35:43.576
Oh, man, super dirty, though.
Dang it.

802
00:35:43.706 --> 00:35:45.075
I've got some rags
and a paper towel in the car.

803
00:35:45.099 --> 00:35:46.099
I'll be right back.

804
00:37:35.688 --> 00:37:36.732
That felt good.

805
00:37:36.819 --> 00:37:38.821
It looked good.

806
00:37:38.952 --> 00:37:41.520
It looked really good.

807
00:37:41.607 --> 00:37:42.999
I didn't know you still danced.

808
00:37:43.130 --> 00:37:44.871
I don't.

809
00:37:44.958 --> 00:37:47.221
You know what?

810
00:37:47.308 --> 00:37:49.441
This is a great space.

811
00:37:49.528 --> 00:37:50.790
It is. I...

812
00:37:50.920 --> 00:37:53.183
I think you should do
the recital here.

813
00:37:53.271 --> 00:37:54.489
I mean, think about it.

814
00:37:54.620 --> 00:37:56.448
You've got more room
for the audience,

815
00:37:56.578 --> 00:37:58.450
and... and more room
for the dancers,

816
00:37:58.537 --> 00:38:01.017
and all the tickets
you could sell.

817
00:38:01.104 --> 00:38:02.323
We don't have enough time.

818
00:38:02.410 --> 00:38:03.629
I mean, it's a great idea,

819
00:38:03.759 --> 00:38:05.413
but this place is a mess.
No, no, no.

820
00:38:05.544 --> 00:38:07.348
We can just give it
a few coats of paint, and a...

821
00:38:07.372 --> 00:38:10.288
And, like, a proper backdrop,
a few well-placed lights.

822
00:38:10.375 --> 00:38:12.681
I totally see it.

823
00:38:12.812 --> 00:38:14.292
I mean, I...

824
00:38:14.379 --> 00:38:16.400
I could probably get permission
to do the improvement.

825
00:38:16.424 --> 00:38:17.599
Yes, there you go.

826
00:38:17.686 --> 00:38:19.688
And we can get
the community involved.

827
00:38:19.775 --> 00:38:21.211
Okay.

828
00:38:21.299 --> 00:38:22.387
Okay?

829
00:38:22.474 --> 00:38:23.692
Yeah.

830
00:38:23.779 --> 00:38:26.042
No what if's, right?

831
00:38:26.173 --> 00:38:28.218
Exactly.

832
00:38:45.801 --> 00:38:47.890
Oh.

833
00:38:48.021 --> 00:38:49.501
Here you go.

834
00:38:49.631 --> 00:38:52.895
Ah, my favorite drink.
Thank you.

835
00:38:53.026 --> 00:38:55.420
Infused with chocolate,
mint, and holiday spirit.

836
00:38:55.507 --> 00:38:57.944
It's good for us.
Mm. Salut.

837
00:38:58.031 --> 00:38:59.728
All right, so I have news.

838
00:38:59.815 --> 00:39:01.991
Strings officially pulled.

839
00:39:02.078 --> 00:39:04.690
The barn is ours to use
and renovate.

840
00:39:04.777 --> 00:39:06.735
That was fast.
How'd you pull that off?

841
00:39:06.822 --> 00:39:08.955
I teach the mayor's
granddaughter jazz, so.

842
00:39:09.085 --> 00:39:10.086
He's kind of on our side.

843
00:39:10.173 --> 00:39:11.566
Nice.

844
00:39:11.653 --> 00:39:13.916
Mm.

845
00:39:14.047 --> 00:39:16.919
But now we need a floor
people won't fall through

846
00:39:17.050 --> 00:39:19.008
and a roof that actually works
as a roof.

847
00:39:19.095 --> 00:39:20.270
We should start outsourcing.

848
00:39:20.358 --> 00:39:22.098
Yeah, I can recruit some people.

849
00:39:22.229 --> 00:39:23.796
What about you?
How about Marissa?

850
00:39:23.926 --> 00:39:24.971
- Perfect.
- Yeah,

851
00:39:25.058 --> 00:39:26.252
all her friends
are firefighters.

852
00:39:26.276 --> 00:39:27.495
They love helping people.

853
00:39:27.626 --> 00:39:29.932
That's what they do.

854
00:39:30.019 --> 00:39:32.935
So you think just 'cause
we're all EMTs and firefighters

855
00:39:33.022 --> 00:39:35.460
that we're gonna help you
with this thing?

856
00:39:35.547 --> 00:39:37.505
Uh, yeah.

857
00:39:37.636 --> 00:39:39.289
Of course we will.

858
00:39:39.420 --> 00:39:41.596
It's what we do.
Thank you.

859
00:39:41.683 --> 00:39:44.120
Yeah.

860
00:39:44.207 --> 00:39:46.079
Yeah...

861
00:39:46.166 --> 00:39:47.254
Is everything okay?

862
00:39:47.385 --> 00:39:48.951
I...

863
00:39:49.038 --> 00:39:50.431
It's just...

864
00:39:50.518 --> 00:39:53.913
sometimes, this single mom
thing is hard.

865
00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:55.020
You want to talk about it?

866
00:39:55.044 --> 00:39:56.176
- Well, I got a...
- Yo, Tío!

867
00:39:56.263 --> 00:39:58.265
I'm officially on winter break.

868
00:39:58.352 --> 00:40:00.267
You want to join me
for a little step sesh?

869
00:40:00.398 --> 00:40:01.964
I got moves, I got flair,
I got...

870
00:40:02.051 --> 00:40:04.619
You've got
some explaining to do.

871
00:40:04.706 --> 00:40:07.448
I got a call from your teacher
this afternoon.

872
00:40:07.535 --> 00:40:09.755
She said you got a D
on your geography test,

873
00:40:09.842 --> 00:40:12.758
and you weren't even trying.

874
00:40:12.888 --> 00:40:15.500
She thinks it's best if you
retake geography next semester.

875
00:40:15.630 --> 00:40:18.198
No, I can't!

876
00:40:18.285 --> 00:40:20.592
I talked her into letting you
retake the test this Friday.

877
00:40:20.722 --> 00:40:22.681
Now, I know it's winter break,

878
00:40:22.768 --> 00:40:24.528
but this is the last chance
you have at this.

879
00:40:24.639 --> 00:40:26.467
Mom, I'm sorry.

880
00:40:26.554 --> 00:40:28.774
I'm sorry too.

881
00:40:28.861 --> 00:40:31.994
I hate this, but for now,

882
00:40:32.081 --> 00:40:33.102
I gotta pull you
from the recital.

883
00:40:33.126 --> 00:40:35.128
- No!
- Mom!

884
00:40:35.258 --> 00:40:36.434
Sorry.

885
00:40:36.521 --> 00:40:38.566
Tío, tell her
she's being unfair...

886
00:40:38.653 --> 00:40:40.196
I'm not telling her
she's being anything

887
00:40:40.220 --> 00:40:41.961
except a great mom.

888
00:40:42.048 --> 00:40:44.267
You are studying
this winter break.

889
00:40:44.354 --> 00:40:46.835
Go.

890
00:41:03.635 --> 00:41:05.593
So it pretty much needs
a whole new paint job,

891
00:41:05.680 --> 00:41:08.422
a brand new barn door,
and inside's a hot mess.

892
00:41:08.509 --> 00:41:09.945
Huh.

893
00:41:10.032 --> 00:41:12.731
You really got your
soft hands full, huh?

894
00:41:12.818 --> 00:41:15.516
I got it... floor, the roof,
whatever you need.

895
00:41:15.603 --> 00:41:17.257
Consider it
my Christmas present.

896
00:41:17.344 --> 00:41:18.476
- Hey...
- To Rae, of course,

897
00:41:18.606 --> 00:41:20.869
not you.
Well then, I won't thank you.

898
00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:23.176
Just stick
to your stuff on stage,

899
00:41:23.263 --> 00:41:24.327
and me and the guys
at the station,

900
00:41:24.351 --> 00:41:25.657
we got the rest.

901
00:41:25.787 --> 00:41:27.397
Oh, and Junior will hang out...

902
00:41:27.528 --> 00:41:28.528
And study.

903
00:41:28.616 --> 00:41:29.736
I'll keep an eye out on him.

Your sister and her crew
are life savers...

914
00:42:27.196 --> 00:42:30.025
Or apparently barn savers.

915
00:42:30.112 --> 00:42:32.941
Hey, guys, thank you so much.
Yes.

916
00:42:33.072 --> 00:42:34.266
It's definitely been
a labor of love.

917
00:42:34.290 --> 00:42:35.422
I love this town.

918
00:42:35.509 --> 00:42:37.380
Everyone's always
willing to help.

919
00:42:37.467 --> 00:42:40.296
This place brings me
my maximum joy.

920
00:42:40.427 --> 00:42:41.733
Maximum joy.

921
00:42:41.820 --> 00:42:43.952
I like that.

922
00:42:44.039 --> 00:42:45.824
Okay, so can I see the progress?

923
00:42:45.954 --> 00:42:47.739
We're almost finished
working on the inside,

924
00:42:47.826 --> 00:42:49.368
but there's still this
Christmas light thing

925
00:42:49.392 --> 00:42:50.698
that I want to try.

926
00:42:50.785 --> 00:42:51.873
Maybe I could show you

927
00:42:51.960 --> 00:42:53.614
the finished product
later tonight?

928
00:42:53.701 --> 00:42:56.225
I have dance rehearsals
until 6:00 with the kids.

929
00:42:56.356 --> 00:42:58.053
Wanna meet me here afterward?

930
00:42:58.140 --> 00:42:59.925
Yeah, that's great.

931
00:43:00.055 --> 00:43:01.143
See you then.
All right.

932
00:43:01.274 --> 00:43:02.274
Thanks, guys.

933
00:43:04.582 --> 00:43:05.147
You guys are making me
look good.

934
00:43:05.234 --> 00:43:06.235
Nice.

935
00:43:18.291 --> 00:43:21.686
So what do you think?

936
00:43:21.773 --> 00:43:24.689
Billy, this is...

937
00:43:24.819 --> 00:43:26.516
this is amazing.

938
00:43:29.563 --> 00:43:31.130
Nice little holiday touch.

939
00:43:31.217 --> 00:43:34.307
With a lot of help from
the Garnet Fire Department.

940
00:43:34.394 --> 00:43:35.961
I'm glad you stayed off
the ladder.

941
00:43:36.048 --> 00:43:37.092
Yeah, me too.

942
00:43:37.179 --> 00:43:39.921
Shall we?

943
00:43:40.052 --> 00:43:41.140
This is so sweet.

944
00:43:45.318 --> 00:43:47.450
Ooh, that looks good.

945
00:43:47.537 --> 00:43:48.626
What is it?

946
00:43:48.756 --> 00:43:49.975
My mom's famous chile relleno.

947
00:43:50.105 --> 00:43:52.194
Mmm.

948
00:43:52.325 --> 00:43:53.543
Thank you.

949
00:43:53.674 --> 00:43:55.023
I needed this.

950
00:43:55.110 --> 00:43:57.156
Oh, and the record player.

951
00:43:57.243 --> 00:43:59.637
I love it.

952
00:43:59.724 --> 00:44:01.508
Little holiday music
to set the mood.

953
00:44:02.770 --> 00:44:04.903
You know, um, earlier today,

954
00:44:04.990 --> 00:44:06.426
I heard a fireman singing

955
00:44:06.513 --> 00:44:09.559
while he was helping
with the lights, and...

956
00:44:09.647 --> 00:44:11.605
my guy had an incredible voice.

957
00:44:11.736 --> 00:44:14.564
And I was just thinking...

958
00:44:14.695 --> 00:44:16.238
this guy's just out here
putting out fires,

959
00:44:16.262 --> 00:44:17.350
hiding that killer voice.

960
00:44:17.480 --> 00:44:20.048
Yeah. It's crazy.

961
00:44:20.135 --> 00:44:21.528
The mayor, although long-winded,

962
00:44:21.615 --> 00:44:23.312
is a very talented poet,

963
00:44:23.399 --> 00:44:24.799
and the florist,
she's a comedienne.

964
00:44:24.923 --> 00:44:28.404
I mean, there is so much talent
in this town.

965
00:44:28.491 --> 00:44:30.644
It's a shame we can't showcase
everyone for the recital.

966
00:44:34.019 --> 00:44:35.934
Can we showcase this town
in the recital?

967
00:44:38.066 --> 00:44:39.589
Why can't we?

968
00:44:41.983 --> 00:44:43.855
Are we totally
transforming this recital

969
00:44:43.985 --> 00:44:46.335
into something
even more awesome?

970
00:44:46.422 --> 00:44:48.076
Kinda sounds like
we're holding auditions.

971
00:44:49.556 --> 00:44:51.427
Recital and a talent show together.

972
00:44:55.344 --> 00:44:57.477
Thank you for doing this
with me.

973
00:44:57.564 --> 00:44:58.783
Oh, don't thank me.

974
00:44:58.870 --> 00:45:01.481
This is fun.

975
00:45:02.525 --> 00:45:04.963
<i>Salut.</i>

976
00:45:21.022 --> 00:45:22.458
Everybody wants to audition

977
00:45:22.545 --> 00:45:23.785
for the local boy who made good.

978
00:45:25.418 --> 00:45:26.593
Hey, guys.

979
00:45:26.680 --> 00:45:28.247
How you doing, hello.

980
00:45:28.377 --> 00:45:29.727
Jun.

981
00:45:29.814 --> 00:45:31.454
What's the latest
with the re-test, buddy?

982
00:45:31.554 --> 00:45:32.662
Just a couple of days to study,

983
00:45:32.686 --> 00:45:33.992
then I'll be ready for it.

984
00:45:34.079 --> 00:45:36.298
I'll know by Friday
if I'm back on the show.

985
00:45:36.385 --> 00:45:37.473
You got this, mijo.

986
00:45:37.560 --> 00:45:38.866
I'm really proud of you, Junior.

987
00:45:38.997 --> 00:45:40.670
It's like with dance...
If you put in the work,

988
00:45:40.694 --> 00:45:41.521
you'll see the reward.

989
00:45:41.608 --> 00:45:43.349
That's right.

990
00:45:43.436 --> 00:45:45.481
All right, the judges chair.

991
00:45:45.568 --> 00:45:47.353
Where you belong.

992
00:45:47.483 --> 00:45:50.530
It's been a while.

993
00:45:50.617 --> 00:45:53.489
How's it feel?

994
00:45:53.620 --> 00:45:55.840
Pretty good, actually.

995
00:45:55.927 --> 00:45:57.972
Good.

996
00:45:58.059 --> 00:45:59.104

What about me?

1020
00:47:26.321 --> 00:47:28.236
Should I add you to the lineup?

1021
00:47:28.367 --> 00:47:29.890
No, no, no, no, no.

1022
00:47:29.977 --> 00:47:31.457
That's not me anymore.

1023
00:47:31.544 --> 00:47:34.634
I saw you dancing,
and it definitely is you.

1024
00:47:34.721 --> 00:47:36.592
And believe me, you're...

1025
00:47:36.679 --> 00:47:38.072
You're really good.

1026
00:47:38.203 --> 00:47:40.814
Not good enough to keep
a show on the air.

1027
00:47:40.945 --> 00:47:43.208
Their loss, our gain.

1028
00:47:45.601 --> 00:47:47.101
Look, we got a lot
to go over right here,

1029
00:47:47.125 --> 00:47:50.258
so why don't... why don't
we talk about it later, huh?

1030
00:47:50.345 --> 00:47:51.956
Okay.

1031
00:47:52.086 --> 00:47:53.435
Whenever you're ready.

1032
00:48:07.493 --> 00:48:09.364
So I think your dancers

1033
00:48:09.451 --> 00:48:11.323
can just come through the aisle
like this.

1034
00:48:11.410 --> 00:48:13.151
And then they take the stage,

1035
00:48:13.281 --> 00:48:15.849
and all the parents
can see them all up close.

1036
00:48:15.936 --> 00:48:17.242
That's fabulous.

1037
00:48:17.329 --> 00:48:18.896
I'm not sure
where we put the band yet,

1038
00:48:18.983 --> 00:48:21.420
but I do know I need to get
a demo from those guys

1039
00:48:21.550 --> 00:48:22.377
'cause they have a unique sound,

1040
00:48:22.464 --> 00:48:24.118
and I think they can blow up.

1041
00:48:24.205 --> 00:48:26.425
Well, maybe in their mind,
they already have.

1042
00:48:26.555 --> 00:48:28.862
You know, they play their music,

1043
00:48:28.949 --> 00:48:31.604
they have their families,
they live in a place they love.

1044
00:48:31.691 --> 00:48:34.650
They might love other places,
too, you never know.

1045
00:48:34.737 --> 00:48:36.585
Like you said, you never
want to go through life

1046
00:48:36.609 --> 00:48:39.177
with what if's.

1047
00:48:39.264 --> 00:48:40.763
There's a difference between
wanting to make it

1048
00:48:40.787 --> 00:48:41.831
and not being able to,

1049
00:48:41.919 --> 00:48:43.529
and consciously choosing
to value

1050
00:48:43.616 --> 00:48:46.662
other parts of your life
above making it big.

1051
00:48:46.793 --> 00:48:48.316
Both choices are okay.

1052
00:49:03.462 --> 00:49:06.552
Ah, Guillermo!

1053
00:49:06.639 --> 00:49:09.294
Something's on your mind.

1054
00:49:09.424 --> 00:49:11.774
Oh, dear, you shouldn't worry.

1055
00:49:11.861 --> 00:49:15.213
That wrinkle on your forehead
is only gonna get deeper.

1056
00:49:15.300 --> 00:49:17.215
Here.

1057
00:49:20.131 --> 00:49:21.784
Mom, let me ask you something.

1058
00:49:21.915 --> 00:49:24.265
Were you upset when I left?

1059
00:49:24.352 --> 00:49:26.224
I was excited.

1060
00:49:26.311 --> 00:49:28.704
I missed you, but...

1061
00:49:28.791 --> 00:49:30.358
I knew you were doing
what you loved.

1062
00:49:30.445 --> 00:49:31.838
Which is great, right?

1063
00:49:31.925 --> 00:49:34.188
Yes.
Of course...

1064
00:49:34.319 --> 00:49:37.017
things were different
without you.

1065
00:49:37.104 --> 00:49:39.585
I know I couldn't always
make it home for Christmas

1066
00:49:39.715 --> 00:49:41.955
because of my specials, but I
did come home when I could.

1067
00:49:42.066 --> 00:49:45.069
Yes. Absolutely.

1068
00:49:45.199 --> 00:49:46.896
A day or two.

1069
00:49:47.027 --> 00:49:49.987
After Christmas.

1070
00:49:50.117 --> 00:49:52.728
Whenever you could spare it.

1071
00:49:52.859 --> 00:49:56.384
Ah, we were so proud of you, mijo.

1072
00:49:56.515 --> 00:49:57.515
We still are.

1073
00:50:03.043 --> 00:50:04.566
What's all this about?

1074
00:50:07.091 --> 00:50:08.179
I think I was so busy

1075
00:50:08.309 --> 00:50:10.268
and just so focused on my goals,

1076
00:50:10.355 --> 00:50:14.533
I just prioritized things
differently, but...

1077
00:50:14.620 --> 00:50:17.101
being back here I realize

1078
00:50:17.188 --> 00:50:21.583
this place and this family,

1079
00:50:21.670 --> 00:50:24.456
it's a big part
of my maximum joy.

1080
00:50:24.543 --> 00:50:26.110
Maximum joy? What's this?

1081
00:50:29.026 --> 00:50:32.029
I'm still trying
to figure that out.

1082
00:50:32.116 --> 00:50:34.988
I do know, when I go back,

1083
00:50:35.075 --> 00:50:37.947
I'm gonna schedule a lot
more trips to come home.

1084
00:50:38.035 --> 00:50:39.949
To see you.

1085
00:50:40.037 --> 00:50:43.431
That would be my maximum joy.

1086
00:50:58.664 --> 00:50:59.969
All this talent,

1087
00:51:00.100 --> 00:51:02.668
and you're not even gonna be
in the show.

1088
00:51:02.798 --> 00:51:04.037
You know I'm a behind
the scenes guy now, right?

1089
00:51:04.061 --> 00:51:07.107
Well, that's on you, though.

1090
00:51:07.238 --> 00:51:08.824
I know everybody
would be excited for you

1091
00:51:08.848 --> 00:51:10.328
to be on stage again.

1092
00:51:10.458 --> 00:51:12.069
Please.

1093
00:51:12.156 --> 00:51:13.983
You don't have to be
perfect, Billy.

1094
00:51:14.071 --> 00:51:15.594
Why y'all up
in my business right now?

1095
00:51:17.161 --> 00:51:20.120
Maybe 'cause it's easier
than being in mine.

1096
00:51:20.207 --> 00:51:22.340
I just...
I want you to remember that,

1097
00:51:22.470 --> 00:51:24.342
at your core,

1098
00:51:24.472 --> 00:51:25.821
you're this guy.

1099
00:51:25.952 --> 00:51:27.214
Not that guy.

1100
00:51:30.087 --> 00:51:33.786
I'm not sure I recognize
either one of them.

1101
00:51:33.916 --> 00:51:36.615
You're not Mr. Holiday here.

1102
00:51:36.702 --> 00:51:39.008
You just have to be Billy.

1103
00:51:39.139 --> 00:51:41.402
And if that means that you want
to dance for fun,

1104
00:51:41.533 --> 00:51:43.187
then dance for fun!

1105
00:51:43.317 --> 00:51:45.363
And if that also means

1106
00:51:45.450 --> 00:51:48.105
that you are falling for a woman

1107
00:51:48.235 --> 00:51:49.628
who doesn't have a publicist?

1108
00:51:49.715 --> 00:51:53.414
Then fall.

1109
00:51:53.501 --> 00:51:55.610
You haven't been sharing this
with other people, have you?

1110
00:51:55.634 --> 00:51:59.290
No, no. No one.
Was just...

1111
00:51:59.377 --> 00:52:00.737
So I hear you're dating
my teacher?

1112
00:52:03.163 --> 00:52:05.209
I'm not dating anyone.

1113
00:52:05.296 --> 00:52:07.602
And she's nice, too, mijo.

1114
00:52:07.689 --> 00:52:09.517
Seriously?

1115
00:52:09.604 --> 00:52:11.780
I got a big mouth.

1116
00:52:11.867 --> 00:52:13.187
All right, you guys,
you gotta go,

1117
00:52:13.217 --> 00:52:14.585
because Billy needs to get
his beauty sleep.

1118
00:52:14.609 --> 00:52:16.220
So out, out, out, out.
Oh, okay.

1119
00:52:16.350 --> 00:52:17.612
Hey, hey, hey.

1120
00:52:17.699 --> 00:52:18.700
Leave the cookies.

1121
00:52:18.831 --> 00:52:20.224
And the hot chocolate.

1122
00:52:24.532 --> 00:52:25.532
Thank you.

1123
00:52:25.620 --> 00:52:27.231
For...

1124
00:52:27.361 --> 00:52:28.580
the reminder.

1125
00:52:28.710 --> 00:52:30.930
You're welcome.

1126
00:52:31.060 --> 00:52:32.975
Now, if you would just
stop being such a wimp

1127
00:52:33.062 --> 00:52:35.935
and tell her how you feel!

1128
00:52:36.065 --> 00:52:38.546
Oh, and I might've told
one or two other people.

1143
00:53:34.123 --> 00:53:36.169
- Hey.
- Hi.

1144
00:53:36.300 --> 00:53:37.388
What are you doing here?

1145
00:53:37.475 --> 00:53:39.607
I was walking to get
a cup of coffee,

1146
00:53:39.694 --> 00:53:41.566
but everything's closed.

1147
00:53:43.132 --> 00:53:44.132
It's 10:00.

1148
00:53:44.177 --> 00:53:46.440
You forgot where you were.

1149
00:53:46.527 --> 00:53:48.486
It's mainly the walk I wanted.

1150
00:53:48.573 --> 00:53:50.009
And...

1151
00:53:50.139 --> 00:53:53.317
I was thinking about you.

1152
00:53:53.447 --> 00:53:56.798
You and the show.

1153
00:53:56.929 --> 00:53:58.800
Yeah, I've, um,

1154
00:53:58.887 --> 00:54:00.802
I've been thinking about it too.

1155
00:54:00.933 --> 00:54:03.152
I wanted to ask you
one last time

1156
00:54:03.283 --> 00:54:05.590
if you would consider dancing
if it was...

1157
00:54:05.720 --> 00:54:06.852
With me?

1158
00:54:06.939 --> 00:54:08.680
No pressure, not for TV.

1159
00:54:08.767 --> 00:54:11.987
Just us having fun
in our own show.

1160
00:54:12.074 --> 00:54:14.425
Like a couples dance?

1161
00:54:14.512 --> 00:54:17.428
It can be whatever
we want it to be.

1162
00:54:17.515 --> 00:54:20.474
Do you wanna go inside
and figure it out?

1163
00:54:20.561 --> 00:54:23.521
- Okay.
- Okay.

1164
00:54:26.741 --> 00:54:28.090
All right.
Let's try some styles.

1165
00:54:28.177 --> 00:54:29.744
- Okay, here we go.
- Okay.

1166
00:54:29.831 --> 00:54:31.442
- Ooh.
- Ouch.

1167
00:54:31.529 --> 00:54:32.965
- Uh, sorry.
- It's okay.

1168
00:54:33.052 --> 00:54:34.271
Um.

1169
00:54:34.358 --> 00:54:37.099
We're just shaking off
the rust, so, uh,

1170
00:54:37.186 --> 00:54:40.146
how about a foxtrot?
Okay.

1171
00:54:40.277 --> 00:54:42.017
And...

1172
00:54:45.847 --> 00:54:47.127
Eh, that's not right.
Eh, yeah.

1173
00:54:47.240 --> 00:54:49.547
That's not right. Um...

1174
00:54:49.634 --> 00:54:50.785
What if we try something
a little more fun,

1175
00:54:50.809 --> 00:54:53.159
like a... like a Lindy Hop?

1176
00:54:53.246 --> 00:54:55.292
- Okay.
- Okay.

1177
00:54:55.379 --> 00:54:56.684
Ready?
And...

1178
00:54:59.861 --> 00:55:01.776
Nah, that... that's, like,
too much fun.

1179
00:55:01.907 --> 00:55:03.691
You know what I mean? Um.

1180
00:55:03.822 --> 00:55:06.433
We need to do something
that builds,

1181
00:55:06.564 --> 00:55:10.307
and it has excitement,
with an amazing finish.

1182
00:55:10.394 --> 00:55:11.743
How about a paso?

1183
00:55:11.830 --> 00:55:13.329
- Okay, let's try it.
- All right, here we go.

1184
00:55:13.353 --> 00:55:15.355
All right, and...

1185
00:55:28.803 --> 00:55:30.065
Coffee?

1186
00:55:30.152 --> 00:55:31.589
Yeah.

1187
00:55:31.719 --> 00:55:33.721
Yeah. Coffee.

1188
00:55:40.249 --> 00:55:41.836
You're lucky I still had
Phoebe's spare key.

1189
00:55:41.860 --> 00:55:43.470
Ooh.
You got great balance.

1190
00:55:43.557 --> 00:55:45.733
What are you, a dancer?

1191
00:55:45.820 --> 00:55:47.842
Every dancer in New York waited
tables at some point, right?

1192
00:55:47.866 --> 00:55:49.302
I know I did.

1193
00:55:49.433 --> 00:55:51.233
So when did dancing...
So when did you move-

1194
00:55:52.218 --> 00:55:53.480
I'll go first.

1195
00:55:53.611 --> 00:55:55.700
Remember those lottery
commercials in New York

1196
00:55:55.830 --> 00:55:57.571
with the dancing lotto balls?

1197
00:55:57.702 --> 00:55:59.225
No, but I feel like I'm gonna do

1198
00:55:59.312 --> 00:56:01.096
a deep YouTube dive later.

1199
00:56:01.183 --> 00:56:02.343
Good luck trying to find that.

1200
00:56:03.577 --> 00:56:05.840
Anyway, that was my first
pro gig in New York.

1201
00:56:05.927 --> 00:56:07.320
I was number five.

1202
00:56:07.407 --> 00:56:08.539
It's on my résumé.

1203
00:56:08.669 --> 00:56:10.454
"Billy Hernandez,
Number Five Lotto Ball."

1204
00:56:11.977 --> 00:56:13.413
- Your turn.
- Okay.

1205
00:56:13.544 --> 00:56:15.763
"Lion King."

1206
00:56:15.894 --> 00:56:17.175
You got your start
in "Lion King"?

1207
00:56:17.199 --> 00:56:19.158
On Broadway? That's amazing.

1208
00:56:19.245 --> 00:56:20.986
You are talking to the back end

1209
00:56:21.073 --> 00:56:22.857
of the middle giraffe.

1210
00:56:25.686 --> 00:56:28.472
But I... I had some other
bigger auditions too.

1211
00:56:28.602 --> 00:56:29.908
Oh, yeah, like what?

1212
00:56:29.995 --> 00:56:33.390
I was the lead dancer
on the Katy Perry tour.

1213
00:56:33.477 --> 00:56:36.131
Yeah, we went everywhere...
Miami, LA.

1214
00:56:36.218 --> 00:56:37.872
I'd made it,
as far as I was concerned.

1215
00:56:38.003 --> 00:56:39.047
That's huge break.

1216
00:56:39.134 --> 00:56:40.919
Yeah, it was.

1217
00:56:41.006 --> 00:56:43.878
But I resigned six weeks
into the tour.

1218
00:56:43.965 --> 00:56:45.358
I hated the road,

1219
00:56:45.489 --> 00:56:47.795
hated living out of a suitcase.

1220
00:56:47.882 --> 00:56:49.623
I felt...

1221
00:56:49.710 --> 00:56:52.017
rootless, and I was...

1222
00:56:52.104 --> 00:56:53.497
I was homesick.

1223
00:56:53.627 --> 00:56:55.716
So I came back here,
and I started teaching

1224
00:56:55.803 --> 00:56:59.807
at my mom's studio,
and I immediately felt better.

1225
00:56:59.894 --> 00:57:01.853
I proved to myself
that I could do it.

1226
00:57:01.983 --> 00:57:05.900
And then I chose to do
what made me truly happy.

1227
00:57:05.987 --> 00:57:07.424
So you came back home.

1228
00:57:09.556 --> 00:57:11.689
And this is where you made it.

1229
00:57:11.776 --> 00:57:13.952
Best decision of my life.

1230
00:57:14.082 --> 00:57:16.345
Maximum joy.

1231
00:57:16.476 --> 00:57:19.044
I like that.

1232
00:57:19.131 --> 00:57:21.525
Well, I'll admit,

1233
00:57:21.612 --> 00:57:24.919
you've been bringing some
maximum joy to my life lately.

1234
00:57:25.006 --> 00:57:27.531
Really?

1235
00:57:27.618 --> 00:57:29.271
Really.

1236
00:57:29.358 --> 00:57:31.360
You and this pie.

1237
00:57:31.448 --> 00:57:34.407
Okay.

1238
00:57:34.538 --> 00:57:36.429
- What've you got right there?
- I got some apple.

1239
00:57:36.453 --> 00:57:38.193
What do you got?

1240
00:57:53.339 --> 00:57:57.735
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

1241
00:57:57.865 --> 00:58:01.913
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, and eight.

1242
00:58:02.043 --> 00:58:05.656
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

1243
00:58:08.876 --> 00:58:11.183
Junior.

1244
00:58:11.313 --> 00:58:13.751
I'm sorry.

1245
00:58:13.838 --> 00:58:15.579
One more day until we know
where you stand.

1246
00:58:15.666 --> 00:58:17.102
You got this, okay?

1247
00:58:17.189 --> 00:58:18.340
All right, you guys, great job.

1248
00:58:18.364 --> 00:58:19.844
Hey, Jun, come here a minute.

1249
00:58:23.151 --> 00:58:25.153
I'm dying to dance, Tío.

1250
00:58:25.240 --> 00:58:27.329
Yeah, I know you are. Look.

1251
00:58:27.416 --> 00:58:29.157
Has anyone ever told you
what it's like

1252
00:58:29.244 --> 00:58:31.029
auditioning as a professional?

1253
00:58:31.116 --> 00:58:33.640
No, but I'm sure
I could handle it.

1254
00:58:33.727 --> 00:58:34.859
They line you up

1255
00:58:34.946 --> 00:58:36.425
with all these other
amazing dancers

1256
00:58:36.556 --> 00:58:37.731
in New York City.

1257
00:58:37.862 --> 00:58:40.081
The best dancers
from every small town

1258
00:58:40.212 --> 00:58:41.213
in the whole country.

1259
00:58:41.343 --> 00:58:43.824
Then a dance captain performs,

1260
00:58:43.911 --> 00:58:46.218
and you're expected to do
exactly what you just saw,

1261
00:58:46.348 --> 00:58:47.219
and if you make even one mistake...

1262
00:58:47.306 --> 00:58:48.916
You're out.

1263
00:58:49.003 --> 00:58:51.484
- No retakes?
- None.

1264
00:58:51.615 --> 00:58:53.288
That's why I didn't land
my first professional gig

1265
00:58:53.312 --> 00:58:54.748
for, like, 27 months.

1266
00:58:54.879 --> 00:58:56.663
27 months?

1267
00:58:56.750 --> 00:58:59.100
That's forever.

1268
00:58:59.187 --> 00:59:00.556
What'd you think,
I just left Garnet

1269
00:59:00.580 --> 00:59:02.364
and they put me on television?
Pretty much.

1270
00:59:02.451 --> 00:59:04.715
You never told me
how hard it was.

1271
00:59:04.845 --> 00:59:07.108
It's why Rae and I are always
saying, balance on stage...

1272
00:59:07.239 --> 00:59:10.677
both: Balance in life.

1273
00:59:10.764 --> 00:59:12.636
Listen,
you know what's not that hard?

1274
00:59:12.723 --> 00:59:14.463
Pulling up your geography grade.

1275
00:59:14.551 --> 00:59:16.814
Just got to study hard.

1276
00:59:16.901 --> 00:59:18.729
Okay.

1277
00:59:20.034 --> 00:59:21.122
Thanks, Tío.

1278
00:59:21.253 --> 00:59:23.037
See you later.

1279
00:59:26.519 --> 00:59:28.477
How was that? Did I do okay?

1280
00:59:28.608 --> 00:59:30.305
You did great.

1281
00:59:30.436 --> 00:59:32.003
By the way,
my first professional job

1282
00:59:32.090 --> 00:59:34.179
took me six months.

1283
00:59:34.266 --> 00:59:36.834
Ooh, excuse me.
That's right, baby giraffe.

1284
00:59:36.921 --> 00:59:38.899
That reminds me, we haven't
even rehearsed our number yet.

1285
00:59:38.923 --> 00:59:40.422
Yeah, I know. Do you have
some time right now?

1286
00:59:40.446 --> 00:59:41.490
How about tomorrow,

1287
00:59:41.578 --> 00:59:43.536
'cause tonight,
I promised my mom

1288
00:59:43.667 --> 00:59:44.668
I'd be home for dinner?

1289
00:59:44.755 --> 00:59:46.147
Okay.

1290
00:59:46.234 --> 00:59:47.453
Would...

1291
00:59:47.540 --> 00:59:49.150
Would you like to join us?

1292
00:59:49.237 --> 00:59:50.717
Yeah.

1293
00:59:50.848 --> 00:59:51.892
I'll bring dessert.

1294
00:59:51.979 --> 00:59:53.415
All right.
I'll see you then.

1295
00:59:53.502 --> 00:59:54.502
Okay.
See you tonight.

1296
01:00:03.077 --> 01:00:04.315
Dallas, thanks for getting
back to me.

1297
01:00:04.339 --> 01:00:05.645
Only took five days.

1298
01:00:05.732 --> 01:00:07.038
Oh, honey, I'm so sorry,

1299
01:00:07.125 --> 01:00:08.822
but Shakira ate a Snickers bar,

1300
01:00:08.953 --> 01:00:10.104
and we were in the hospital
all weekend,

1301
01:00:10.128 --> 01:00:11.869
so we're just coming up
for air now.

1302
01:00:11.956 --> 01:00:14.132
Okay, so what's the latest?

1303
01:00:14.219 --> 01:00:16.438
<i>The laying low strategy
is really working.</i>

1304
01:00:16.525 --> 01:00:18.963
People aren't talking
about you at all.

1305
01:00:19.050 --> 01:00:22.444
Which means they'll do a
double take when you come back.

1306
01:00:22.531 --> 01:00:24.229
No, not, "come back," come back,

1307
01:00:24.359 --> 01:00:26.318
<i>because you're
still heavy in the ether.</i>

1308
01:00:26.405 --> 01:00:27.774
We just need someone
to pick up on it,

1309
01:00:27.798 --> 01:00:31.062
and when they do,
watch out... runaway train!

1310
01:00:31.149 --> 01:00:32.977
<i>Until then, just keep
doing what you're doing.</i>

1311
01:00:33.064 --> 01:00:35.632
Whatever it is you're doing.

1312
01:00:35.762 --> 01:00:38.069
Actually, I've been helping
out with a show down here.

1313
01:00:38.156 --> 01:00:40.549
Oh, that's great news.
What are they paying?

1314
01:00:40.637 --> 01:00:42.116
No, no, no, it's not like that.

1315
01:00:42.203 --> 01:00:43.291
It's... it's just for fun.

1316
01:00:43.378 --> 01:00:45.119
Oh, well.

1317
01:00:45.206 --> 01:00:47.556
I wish I could commission fun,
puddin' pants, but I can't.

1318
01:00:47.644 --> 01:00:48.775
Speaking of puddin' pants...

1319
01:00:48.862 --> 01:00:51.082
Whew, I wish
I could open a window.

1320
01:00:51.169 --> 01:00:54.302
Shakira is still
digesting the Snickers bar.

1321
01:00:54.389 --> 01:00:56.261
Listen, there's so much
local talent here.

1322
01:00:56.391 --> 01:00:59.133
It's crazy... singers, dancers,
the whole deal,

1323
01:00:59.220 --> 01:01:01.658
but they don't have the means
or the opportunities

1324
01:01:01.788 --> 01:01:03.485
necessarily that most people
on TV do...

1325
01:01:03.572 --> 01:01:04.791
Hold the phone.

1326
01:01:04.878 --> 01:01:07.489
Local talent,
small town on display?

1327
01:01:07.576 --> 01:01:08.771
This sounds like
a show the networks

1328
01:01:08.795 --> 01:01:10.033
might want
to take a bite out of.

1329
01:01:10.057 --> 01:01:12.103
Really? Maybe.

1330
01:01:12.233 --> 01:01:13.950
Could be a way for these people
to get their chance

1331
01:01:13.974 --> 01:01:15.212
without having to leave
their whole life behind.

1332
01:01:15.236 --> 01:01:17.717
<i>Listen, why don't you let me
dip my toe</i>

1333
01:01:17.804 --> 01:01:19.153
<i>in the network pool</i>

1334
01:01:19.240 --> 01:01:21.634
and see if the temp
is warm for the idea?

1335
01:01:21.765 --> 01:01:25.333
Well, I guess as long
as it's just a dip.

1336
01:01:25.420 --> 01:01:26.160
I promise not
to go above my ankles.

1337
01:01:26.247 --> 01:01:27.684
How's that?

1338
01:01:27.771 --> 01:01:29.424
<i>Listen, let me get on this,
okay?</i>

1339
01:01:29.555 --> 01:01:30.774
Shakira says bye!

1340
01:01:39.739 --> 01:01:40.890
Okay, I bet you
have room for one more!

1341
01:01:40.914 --> 01:01:43.525
- No, no, no, no, no, no!
- One more!

1342
01:01:43.612 --> 01:01:44.918
Hey, you sleep good that way.

1343
01:01:45.005 --> 01:01:47.094
Come on.

1344
01:01:47.225 --> 01:01:49.793
You know, you have been
smiling all night long.

1345
01:01:49.880 --> 01:01:51.969
Like you have something
to share, what is it?

1346
01:01:52.099 --> 01:01:53.144
No... nothing,

1347
01:01:53.231 --> 01:01:54.382
I'm just enjoying the food, Mom.

1348
01:01:54.406 --> 01:01:55.494
Mm.

1349
01:01:55.581 --> 01:01:57.452
And the company.

1350
01:01:57.539 --> 01:01:59.803
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah, I bet you are.

1351
01:02:02.588 --> 01:02:03.913
Everything's been
so delicious, Irma.

1352
01:02:03.937 --> 01:02:05.591
Thank you.

1353
01:02:05.678 --> 01:02:08.072
It's been really nice
to spend time with all of you.

1354
01:02:08.159 --> 01:02:10.465
Hey, you want to do
some studying?

1355
01:02:10.596 --> 01:02:11.921
Ma, is it cool if
we go in the next room?

1356
01:02:11.945 --> 01:02:13.773
- Do some flashcards?
- No, after dessert.

1357
01:02:13.860 --> 01:02:15.166
Oh, no, that's okay.

1358
01:02:15.296 --> 01:02:17.298
You guys can go ahead.
I'll bring it up to you.

1359
01:02:19.083 --> 01:02:24.305
You know what,
I think I will join you.

1360
01:02:24.436 --> 01:02:29.789
Okay, Billy,
you stay and, uh, help Rae.

1361
01:02:29.920 --> 01:02:31.835
Of course.

1362
01:02:31.922 --> 01:02:34.533
Okay.

1363
01:02:34.620 --> 01:02:35.621
Yeah... go, go.

1364
01:02:35.708 --> 01:02:37.144
Come on, lets go.

1365
01:02:37.275 --> 01:02:40.104
- Just gonna push this...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1366
01:02:40.191 --> 01:02:43.020
- Go, go.
- I'm leaving!

1367
01:02:43.107 --> 01:02:44.369
Ahem.

1368
01:02:51.028 --> 01:02:53.726
Please be sure
to thank Phoebe for these pies.

1369
01:02:53.813 --> 01:02:55.704
It might be awkward because
she doesn't know I took them.

1370
01:02:55.728 --> 01:02:57.774
Oh!

1371
01:02:57.861 --> 01:02:58.992
Cold as ice.

1372
01:02:59.079 --> 01:03:02.082
Hey. Get out of there!

1373
01:03:02.169 --> 01:03:04.389
Are you having a good time?

1374
01:03:04.476 --> 01:03:05.956
Yeah, of course.

1375
01:03:06.043 --> 01:03:07.740
Your family is wonderful.

1376
01:03:07.871 --> 01:03:10.482
And so homey here.

1377
01:03:10.612 --> 01:03:13.746
I love all
the greenery everywhere.

1378
01:03:13.833 --> 01:03:15.704
By the way, that right there

1379
01:03:15.835 --> 01:03:17.706
happens to be
from our family tree.

1380
01:03:17.837 --> 01:03:18.838
Oh, really?

1381
01:03:18.925 --> 01:03:20.971
Uh-huh.
The Hernandez noble fir.

1382
01:03:21.101 --> 01:03:23.147
It's over at Garnett Creek Park.

1383
01:03:23.234 --> 01:03:26.498
Yeah, I know that park.
I passed by it all the time.

1384
01:03:26.585 --> 01:03:28.892
How does one get a family tree?

1385
01:03:28.979 --> 01:03:31.155
My dad saved it from a fire

1386
01:03:31.242 --> 01:03:33.505
when it was just a sapling
and planted it there.

1387
01:03:33.592 --> 01:03:34.941
Took care of it for years.

1388
01:03:35.028 --> 01:03:36.638
He always said,

1389
01:03:36.725 --> 01:03:39.250
"Whatever you focus your
attention on will always grow."

1390
01:03:39.337 --> 01:03:41.992
Hmm. I like that.

1391
01:03:42.079 --> 01:03:44.864
And I agree with your dad.

1392
01:03:44.995 --> 01:03:46.823
So um.

1393
01:03:46.910 --> 01:03:48.781
Listen, I want
to run something by you.

1394
01:03:48.868 --> 01:03:51.436
I'm all ears.

1395
01:03:51.566 --> 01:03:53.351
I've been thinking
a lot about what you said,

1396
01:03:53.438 --> 01:03:56.006
about what-ifs and opportunity,

1397
01:03:56.136 --> 01:03:58.660
and prioritizing home
over making it.

1398
01:03:58.747 --> 01:04:01.141
I want the next thing that
I do to be able

1399
01:04:01.272 --> 01:04:02.577
to include all of that.

1400
01:04:02.664 --> 01:04:03.796
Great idea, Billy.

1401
01:04:03.927 --> 01:04:06.625
It was your idea.

1402
01:04:06.712 --> 01:04:09.062
Centering the show
around discovering talent

1403
01:04:09.149 --> 01:04:11.586
in your own hometown and
bringing an opportunity and...

1404
01:04:11.673 --> 01:04:13.414
And giving them
a choice to go for it.

1405
01:04:13.545 --> 01:04:14.459
Exactly.

1406
01:04:14.546 --> 01:04:16.113
Hmm.

1407
01:04:16.200 --> 01:04:17.723
Would...

1408
01:04:17.810 --> 01:04:21.074
Would you consider being
a part of something like that?

1409
01:04:21.205 --> 01:04:23.598
Me?

1410
01:04:23.685 --> 01:04:25.774
Oh, I...

1411
01:04:25.905 --> 01:04:27.559
I don't know.

1412
01:04:27.646 --> 01:04:31.302
Will you at least
think about it?

1413
01:04:31.389 --> 01:04:33.826
I say we focus
on the rehearsals.

1414
01:04:33.913 --> 01:04:36.611
But yeah, I'll think about it.

1415
01:04:38.352 --> 01:04:40.615
Okay.

1416
01:04:40.702 --> 01:04:43.096
But while you're
thinking about that,

1417
01:04:43.227 --> 01:04:45.403
why don't you
also think about this?

1418
01:04:56.327 --> 01:04:58.938
This is not the way to the
rehearsal we haven't had yet.

1419
01:04:59.069 --> 01:05:01.288
Just a little detour.
It'll be quick.

1420
01:05:07.251 --> 01:05:10.819
So this is the Hernandez fir.

1421
01:05:10.950 --> 01:05:13.605
It's beautiful.

1422
01:05:13.735 --> 01:05:16.216
My dad and I planted it
here together.

1423
01:05:16.303 --> 01:05:19.176
He said he wanted me
to remember my roots.

1424
01:05:19.263 --> 01:05:20.786
Haven't always done that, so...

1425
01:05:23.223 --> 01:05:24.659
It's nice to be back.

1426
01:05:27.401 --> 01:05:29.664
Thank you for bringing me here.

1427
01:05:36.106 --> 01:05:38.804
It's a sign.

1428
01:05:38.891 --> 01:05:40.197
Of what?

1429
01:05:42.155 --> 01:05:43.504
You and I...

1430
01:05:45.854 --> 01:05:50.511
Are going to have a great show.

1431
01:05:50.598 --> 01:05:55.081
Yeah, yeah, we are.

1432
01:05:55.212 --> 01:05:58.345
You know, it could be a sign
or something else.

1433
01:06:00.043 --> 01:06:01.696
You think so?

1434
01:06:01.827 --> 01:06:05.352
Yeah, I do.

1435
01:06:16.842 --> 01:06:18.887
We should really get
to that rehearsal.

1436
01:06:21.194 --> 01:06:23.718
Yeah, we should.

1437
01:06:26.330 --> 01:06:27.896
Does this count
as dance rehearsal?

1438
01:06:31.335 --> 01:06:32.727
Yeah.

1439
01:06:45.697 --> 01:06:47.612
Was that okay?

1440
01:06:47.699 --> 01:06:49.831
My jokes didn't feel
too forced, did they?

1441
01:06:49.918 --> 01:06:51.877
Oh, so good, Jessie, so good.

1442
01:06:51.964 --> 01:06:54.271
The more honest you are
and not trying too hard,

1443
01:06:54.358 --> 01:06:55.924
the funnier and funnier it gets.

1444
01:06:56.012 --> 01:06:59.798
All right.
Hey, listen, everyone.

1445
01:06:59.885 --> 01:07:01.123
That was
a really good rehearsal.

1446
01:07:01.147 --> 01:07:02.844
Don't worry
about the tiny mistakes.

1447
01:07:02.931 --> 01:07:05.011
It's good to get them out now
instead of in the show.

1448
01:07:05.064 --> 01:07:06.587
And remember, it's a fun show!

1449
01:07:06.674 --> 01:07:09.155
Yeah, you guys, just be playful.

1450
01:07:09.242 --> 01:07:10.524
Have fun because
the audience already loves us.

1451
01:07:10.548 --> 01:07:11.873
And it's a celebration
of this time of year.

1452
01:07:11.897 --> 01:07:13.203
That's right.

1453
01:07:13.290 --> 01:07:14.856
Hey, lets practice our dance?

1454
01:07:14.943 --> 01:07:16.983
Yes, it seems like we're
always getting interrupted.

1455
01:07:17.033 --> 01:07:18.033
Ahem.

1456
01:07:23.082 --> 01:07:25.737
Billy, Bravo.

1457
01:07:25.824 --> 01:07:29.306
A little show in a barn.

1458
01:07:29.393 --> 01:07:31.873
It's cute. It's really cute.

1459
01:07:31.960 --> 01:07:34.224
Joanna, wha...
What are you doing here?

1460
01:07:34.354 --> 01:07:35.790
"Celebrity Dance Off" sent me...

1461
01:07:35.877 --> 01:07:37.227
They want you back!

1462
01:07:37.314 --> 01:07:38.769
And they thought
I'd be the most persuasive

1463
01:07:38.793 --> 01:07:41.231
in reeling you back in.

1464
01:07:41.318 --> 01:07:43.102
Uh, I'll be right back.

1465
01:07:47.933 --> 01:07:51.980
I have so much to tell you.

1466
01:07:52.068 --> 01:07:54.592
Oh, I missed you!
Yeah, uh-

1467
01:07:54.679 --> 01:07:56.091
Wait, aren't you going to
introduce me to everyone?

1468
01:07:56.115 --> 01:07:58.335
Everyone, this is Joanna.
Joanna, everyone.

1469
01:08:04.167 --> 01:08:05.472
Jeez, what a commute!

1470
01:08:05.559 --> 01:08:07.996
A plane, a train,
and an automobile.

1471
01:08:08.127 --> 01:08:09.172
But here I am.

1472
01:08:09.302 --> 01:08:10.608
This is cute.

1473
01:08:10.738 --> 01:08:12.175
Well, you didn't call first.

1474
01:08:12.262 --> 01:08:14.438
Not from a plane, a train,
or any of those things.

1475
01:08:14.525 --> 01:08:16.353
I wanted to surprise you.

1476
01:08:16.483 --> 01:08:19.269
You know, people are
talking back home about this.

1477
01:08:19.399 --> 01:08:22.489
This homey Christmas show
you're doing on a little farm.

1478
01:08:22.576 --> 01:08:24.598
It's testing really well.
That's why they want you back.

1479
01:08:24.622 --> 01:08:26.885
It's testing really well...

1480
01:08:26.972 --> 01:08:28.210
How do they even
know about this?

1481
01:08:28.234 --> 01:08:30.018
Some kid named JSteps.

1482
01:08:30.106 --> 01:08:32.499
- Who?
- Hello, your nephew?

1483
01:08:32.586 --> 01:08:34.588
Did you forget
how social media works?

1484
01:08:34.675 --> 01:08:37.243
<i>And my tío, Mr. Holiday,
is in the show too!</i>

1485
01:08:37.374 --> 01:08:38.375
<i>It's a whole vibe.</i>

1486
01:08:46.296 --> 01:08:47.296
<i>Hah!</i>

1487
01:08:50.213 --> 01:08:51.668
So this is how
you found out about me?

1488
01:08:51.692 --> 01:08:55.392
Mm-hm. Listen, before your
comeback is official,

1489
01:08:55.522 --> 01:08:58.264
I just wanted to say
that I am incredibly sorry

1490
01:08:58.351 --> 01:09:00.179
that you got booted
from our show.

1491
01:09:00.266 --> 01:09:02.268
And the Christmas special.

1492
01:09:02.355 --> 01:09:04.923
Oh, which I just
finished filming last night,

1493
01:09:05.010 --> 01:09:06.272
and it was awesome, by the way.

1494
01:09:06.403 --> 01:09:08.970
Anyway, none of those changes
were my idea.

1495
01:09:09.057 --> 01:09:11.669
I just... I didn't realize
how terrible

1496
01:09:11.756 --> 01:09:14.324
this must have been for you.

1497
01:09:14.454 --> 01:09:15.890
Well, it didn't feel great.

1498
01:09:15.977 --> 01:09:17.825
Oh, and can I just say
that with you being gone?

1499
01:09:17.849 --> 01:09:20.504
I was doing your job and my job,

1500
01:09:20.591 --> 01:09:22.897
and it was just
way too much for me.

1501
01:09:23.028 --> 01:09:26.771
So please take back
your producer's chair.

1502
01:09:26.858 --> 01:09:28.076
I really can't talk right now.

1503
01:09:28.164 --> 01:09:29.284
I gotta get back to my show.

1504
01:09:29.339 --> 01:09:32.516
Billy.

1505
01:09:32.603 --> 01:09:35.519
I really, really am sorry
about our show.

1506
01:09:35.606 --> 01:09:38.174
You know?

1507
01:09:38.304 --> 01:09:42.569
Maybe this all happened
for a reason.

1508
01:09:42.700 --> 01:09:45.485
Maybe I was meant to do
something else.

1509
01:09:52.492 --> 01:09:54.364
Mysterious and centered.

1510
01:09:54.494 --> 01:09:56.670
Hmm.

1511
01:09:56.801 --> 01:09:58.106
He seems different.

1512
01:10:00.979 --> 01:10:03.895
Hey, Jun, where's Rae?

1513
01:10:04.025 --> 01:10:05.592
I think she went to her studio.

1514
01:10:17.430 --> 01:10:19.693
Hey, I thought
we were gonna rehearse?

1515
01:10:19.824 --> 01:10:23.044
Yeah, I just needed some air.

1516
01:10:23.175 --> 01:10:26.134
And I'm guessing she or they
or whoever wants you back.

1517
01:10:28.398 --> 01:10:31.575
Yeah.

1518
01:10:31.662 --> 01:10:33.577
- What are we doing?
- What do you mean?

1519
01:10:33.664 --> 01:10:35.622
We're putting on a Christmas
show tomorrow night.

1520
01:10:35.709 --> 01:10:37.450
No, I mean, like,
what are we doing?

1521
01:10:37.581 --> 01:10:39.539
You're obviously
leaving town after this.

1522
01:10:39.626 --> 01:10:41.715
Maybe not...

1523
01:10:41.802 --> 01:10:43.804
Rae, there's a lot
of moving pieces...

1524
01:10:43.891 --> 01:10:45.719
Am I a moving piece?

1525
01:10:45.806 --> 01:10:49.070
No, no, of course not.

1526
01:10:49.157 --> 01:10:50.463
What do you want?

1527
01:10:50.594 --> 01:10:52.160
I want...

1528
01:10:56.339 --> 01:10:58.210
To rehearse this dance
and finish the show.

1529
01:10:58.341 --> 01:11:00.343
Well, then let's do that.

1530
01:12:13.024 --> 01:12:14.982
I'm sorry things got
a little crazy right now,

1531
01:12:15.069 --> 01:12:17.463
but please tell me we're good.

1532
01:12:19.726 --> 01:12:20.901
For the show, yeah.

1533
01:12:23.643 --> 01:12:26.167
Beyond that, I don't know.

1534
01:12:26.254 --> 01:12:27.430
See you tomorrow.

1535
01:12:45.839 --> 01:12:47.885
And his ex is back in town,

1536
01:12:47.972 --> 01:12:50.061
and she's offered him
his job back.

1537
01:12:50.191 --> 01:12:52.585
So...

1538
01:12:52.672 --> 01:12:54.631
you're, uh,
you're all caught up.

1539
01:12:54.718 --> 01:12:57.677
Okay.

1540
01:12:57.808 --> 01:12:59.810
Is he going to take it?

1541
01:12:59.940 --> 01:13:01.681
I don't know.

1542
01:13:01.768 --> 01:13:03.379
Did he talk to you about it?

1543
01:13:05.598 --> 01:13:06.730
Sort of.

1544
01:13:06.817 --> 01:13:09.863
I mean,
I think he... I think he tried

1545
01:13:09.950 --> 01:13:11.275
and then I just said
I wanted to focus on the show.

1546
01:13:11.299 --> 01:13:13.780
So.

1547
01:13:13.911 --> 01:13:17.305
Maybe you should
tell him how you feel.

1548
01:13:17.393 --> 01:13:18.437
Rae, you're always saying

1549
01:13:18.568 --> 01:13:20.483
that you don't want
to live with...

1550
01:13:22.963 --> 01:13:24.487
What-ifs.

1551
01:13:31.755 --> 01:13:34.453
Welcome back to
"Access Hollywood"!

1552
01:13:34.540 --> 01:13:38.152
Is Billy Holiday making
a comeback just weeks after

1553
01:13:38.283 --> 01:13:39.869
his controversial exit
from his hit show?

1554
01:13:39.893 --> 01:13:43.331
Rumor has it he'll be returning
to "Celebrity Dance Off"

1555
01:13:43.462 --> 01:13:45.856
in a miracle worthy
of Christmas... check out this

1556
01:13:45.943 --> 01:13:47.988
exclusive video obtained
by "Access Hollywood"

1557
01:13:48.119 --> 01:13:50.338
that is sure to get
everyone talking.

1558
01:14:00.566 --> 01:14:03.090
Your kid has really
complicated my life, Marissa.

1559
01:14:03.177 --> 01:14:05.310
Sorry, sorry, I just saw it.

1560
01:14:05.397 --> 01:14:07.268
He was bragging to me
about all his

1561
01:14:07.399 --> 01:14:08.966
followers he got because of you.

1562
01:14:09.053 --> 01:14:11.011
Power of social media, bro.

1563
01:14:11.098 --> 01:14:13.013
I even saw it on "Access."

1564
01:14:13.144 --> 01:14:15.712
- It was on "Access Hollywood"?
- Yeah.

1565
01:14:15.799 --> 01:14:18.062
You know, you'd be
really good on that show.

1566
01:14:18.192 --> 01:14:20.978
Yeah, right.
Look, Joanna just showed up.

1567
01:14:21.065 --> 01:14:22.719
Wait, here in person?

1568
01:14:22.806 --> 01:14:23.894
Yeah.

1569
01:14:23.981 --> 01:14:26.505
And apparently,
LA wants me back.

1570
01:14:26.592 --> 01:14:30.074
Well, that's a good thing, right?

1571
01:14:30.161 --> 01:14:32.424
I'm not so sure.

1572
01:14:32.555 --> 01:14:36.472
I'm not gonna lie, Rae is
really changing how I feel.

1573
01:14:36.602 --> 01:14:37.690
Two weeks ago, I would have

1574
01:14:37.777 --> 01:14:40.388
jumped at this chance,
but now...

1575
01:14:40.519 --> 01:14:42.086
I don't know.

1576
01:14:43.870 --> 01:14:45.263
You know what,

1577
01:14:45.393 --> 01:14:48.875
you're gonna make
the right decision for Billy.

1578
01:14:48.962 --> 01:14:52.662
Thanks.

1579
01:14:52.749 --> 01:14:55.752
I'm lucky to have you
as a sister-slash-roommate.

1580
01:14:55.839 --> 01:15:00.147
I am pretty amazing, huh?

1581
01:15:09.766 --> 01:15:11.507
All right, nice, Sam.

1582
01:15:11.594 --> 01:15:13.813
It's straight.
I'll see you tonight.

1583
01:15:13.900 --> 01:15:15.641
Tío, Tío, I did it!
I did it!

1584
01:15:15.728 --> 01:15:16.816
B-plus, B-plus!

1585
01:15:16.947 --> 01:15:18.122
All right, buddy.

1586
01:15:18.209 --> 01:15:19.708
I'm proud of you.
I knew you could do it.

1587
01:15:19.732 --> 01:15:22.256
Now, I promised Junior
I wouldn't hug him.

1588
01:15:22.343 --> 01:15:25.825
But I lied!
Oh, I'm so proud of you!

1589
01:15:25.912 --> 01:15:27.697
- You remember your routine?
- I think so.

1590
01:15:27.827 --> 01:15:30.613
- Okay.
- I can't wait to tell Miss H.

1591
01:15:30.743 --> 01:15:32.310
Is she inside?

1592
01:15:32.440 --> 01:15:34.921
I haven't seen her,
but I'm gonna see her tonight.

1593
01:15:35.008 --> 01:15:36.619
- Let's go get ready, come on.
- Yeah.

1594
01:15:39.535 --> 01:15:41.058
Is everything
all right with Rae?

1595
01:15:41.188 --> 01:15:44.104
Yeah, oh, yeah.
All good.

1596
01:15:57.335 --> 01:15:59.443
Dallas, I can't talk right now.
I'm running late for my show.

1597
01:15:59.467 --> 01:16:02.035
I just picked up
to say Merry Christmas. Bye.

1598
01:16:02.166 --> 01:16:03.404
<i>No, no, no, Billy, don't go,
don't go, don't go!</i>

1599
01:16:03.428 --> 01:16:04.777
What is it?

1600
01:16:04.864 --> 01:16:07.475
Remember that
local talent show idea

1601
01:16:07.563 --> 01:16:08.825
I was gonna dip my toe into?

1602
01:16:08.912 --> 01:16:09.912
Yeah?

1603
01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:11.610
<i>Well, don't be upset.</i>

1604
01:16:11.697 --> 01:16:14.352
But I did a full-on cannonball
into the deep end.

1605
01:16:14.439 --> 01:16:16.963
- Okay.
- Not one, not two.

1606
01:16:17.050 --> 01:16:19.183
But three networks
are interested.

1607
01:16:19.270 --> 01:16:20.924
<i>Sweetheart, as we speak,</i>

1608
01:16:21.011 --> 01:16:24.841
there is a bidding war going on
for "Small Town Talent."

1609
01:16:24.928 --> 01:16:26.973
<i>And you will have
full creative control.</i>

1610
01:16:27.104 --> 01:16:28.255
<i>You'll be able to shoot the show</i>

1611
01:16:28.279 --> 01:16:30.063
<i>where you want
and with who you want.</i>

1612
01:16:30.194 --> 01:16:34.067
Billy, this is your baby, baby,
that I just helped deliver.

1613
01:16:34.154 --> 01:16:35.547
Wait... are you serious?

1614
01:16:35.634 --> 01:16:36.983
I am so serious,

1615
01:16:37.114 --> 01:16:38.744
I'm actually nauseous
from the heavy ether

1616
01:16:38.768 --> 01:16:40.596
that you are putting out there.

1617
01:16:40.683 --> 01:16:42.032
Now, that could be Shakira.

1618
01:16:42.119 --> 01:16:44.904
But either way,
we are so excited for you.

1619
01:16:45.035 --> 01:16:46.950
<i>So are we good to go?</i>

1620
01:16:47.080 --> 01:16:49.822
This is amazing, Dallas,

1621
01:16:49.953 --> 01:16:52.346
but I'm gonna have to get
back to you.

1622
01:16:52.433 --> 01:16:53.672
I'm gonna have to check
and see if

1623
01:16:53.696 --> 01:16:55.393
this is the right thing for us.

1624
01:16:55.523 --> 01:16:58.352
For us? Who's us?

1625
01:16:58.483 --> 01:17:01.573
Rae and I... I'm not doing
the show without her.

1626
01:17:01.704 --> 01:17:05.011
Oh, by the way, please
tell Shakira I said "hiii!"

1627
01:17:18.634 --> 01:17:19.896
The audience is gonna love you.

1628
01:17:19.983 --> 01:17:22.159
Just have fun, okay?
Okay.

1629
01:17:22.289 --> 01:17:23.551
Hey, I need to talk to you.

1630
01:17:23.639 --> 01:17:25.249
Okay, but it's almost showtime.

1631
01:17:25.336 --> 01:17:26.598
Yeah, I just spoke with Dallas.

1632
01:17:26.685 --> 01:17:27.904
Who's Dallas?

1633
01:17:27.991 --> 01:17:29.446
It doesn't matter.
What does matter is that

1634
01:17:29.470 --> 01:17:30.709
they're offering me
another show.

1635
01:17:30.733 --> 01:17:32.299
Yeah, no, I know.

1636
01:17:32.386 --> 01:17:33.826
"Celebrity Dance Off"
wants you back,

1637
01:17:33.910 --> 01:17:35.148
and they shouldn't have
let you go in first place,

1638
01:17:35.172 --> 01:17:36.236
but I'm happy for you,
I really am,

1639
01:17:36.260 --> 01:17:37.914
but it's show time, so lets go.

1640
01:17:38.044 --> 01:17:39.044
That's not...

1641
01:17:46.879 --> 01:17:48.968
Welcome, everybody,
to our holiday show,

1642
01:17:49.055 --> 01:17:50.709
"Christmas Then,
Christmas Now."

1643
01:17:50.840 --> 01:17:53.930
We have some amazing
performers tonight.

1644
01:17:54.017 --> 01:17:56.217
That's right, and isn't it
great to be back in the barn?

1645
01:18:01.067 --> 01:18:03.766
It's gonna be really hard
to say goodbye to you.

1646
01:18:03.853 --> 01:18:05.768
Maybe you won't to have to.

1647
01:18:07.900 --> 01:18:09.597
Enjoy the show!

1648
01:18:14.907 --> 01:18:15.952
Look, I just...

1649
01:18:16.039 --> 01:18:17.257
Let's just talk after the show.

1650
01:18:17.388 --> 01:18:18.955
Hey, you're up.

1651
01:18:19.042 --> 01:18:20.957
You got this.
Break a leg.

1652
01:18:26.702 --> 01:18:28.660
Let's hear it for Billy and Rae.

1653
01:18:37.887 --> 01:18:39.758
I'm gonna tell Santa
I want a man

1654
01:18:39.889 --> 01:18:42.892
to love and a father
for my children.

1655
01:18:42.979 --> 01:18:46.547
And I need Santa to make sure
the two never meet.

1656
01:18:49.899 --> 01:18:51.988
Good night, everybody.
I'm Jesse Woodley.

1657
01:18:52.075 --> 01:18:54.033

I just want you to know...

1705
01:22:26.158 --> 01:22:29.553
I'm not going back
to "Celebrity Dance Off."

1706
01:22:29.640 --> 01:22:30.660
I thought they wanted you back?

1707
01:22:30.684 --> 01:22:33.296
They do.

1708
01:22:33.383 --> 01:22:37.474
I don't want them, I want this.

1709
01:22:37.604 --> 01:22:40.346
- The barn?
- Yes, the barn.

1710
01:22:40.477 --> 01:22:42.740
This is the place
that inspired me...

1711
01:22:42.827 --> 01:22:44.524
It's a place that inspired you,

1712
01:22:44.611 --> 01:22:47.397
and look what it's
doing here tonight.

1713
01:22:47.484 --> 01:22:49.355
I want to make dreams
come true right here.

1714
01:22:49.442 --> 01:22:51.923
That's the show
that I want to do.

1715
01:22:52.010 --> 01:22:54.317
And I want to do it with you.

1716
01:22:56.580 --> 01:22:58.234
With me?

1717
01:23:02.194 --> 01:23:04.501
Hey, guys,
there's no one on stage.

1718
01:23:08.940 --> 01:23:10.159
Oh, shoot, we're on.

1719
01:23:15.816 --> 01:23:17.340
Before our final performance tonight,

1720
01:23:17.427 --> 01:23:20.212
I just want to thank every
single one of the performers

1721
01:23:20.299 --> 01:23:21.909
and all of you in this
building tonight.

1722
01:23:21.997 --> 01:23:23.868
Because of your generosity,

1723
01:23:23.955 --> 01:23:28.220
my dancers, your kids,
are going to New York!

1724
01:23:36.968 --> 01:23:38.641
Now, obviously, none of this
would have happened

1725
01:23:38.665 --> 01:23:40.189
without somebody we all know.

1726
01:23:40.276 --> 01:23:41.886
So Billy?

1727
01:23:47.196 --> 01:23:49.589
Now let's hear it for Rae,
the heart and soul of Garnett.

1728
01:23:55.552 --> 01:23:59.947
And I just like to say quickly
that I love being back home,

1729
01:24:00.035 --> 01:24:04.169
but I'm not here
to make a speech tonight.

1730
01:24:04.256 --> 01:24:06.128
I'm here to dance.

1731
01:24:46.298 --> 01:24:48.431
What if I told you,

1732
01:24:48.561 --> 01:24:51.651
I want to be wherever you are.

1733
01:24:51.782 --> 01:24:53.349
What if I told you,

1734
01:24:53.436 --> 01:24:56.308
I want to be here with you.
