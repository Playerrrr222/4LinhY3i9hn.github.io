1
00:00:48.482 --> 00:00:50.482
You laugh like you're
still five years old.

2
00:00:50.517 --> 00:00:52.182
You look like you're still
five years old.

3
00:00:52.206 --> 00:00:54.689
I know.

4
00:00:57.344 --> 00:00:58.976
Okay. Wait, wait, wait.
Be honest with me.

5
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.137
Is there any part of you
that feels just, like,

6
00:01:01.241 --> 00:01:03.551
a little bit silly for still
doing this in our 30s?

7
00:01:03.586 --> 00:01:05.655
Are you kidding?
It's tradition.

8
00:01:05.758 --> 00:01:09.413
Besides, our wishes
always come true.

9
00:01:09.448 --> 00:01:10.724
I'd be silly not to.

10
00:01:11.586 --> 00:01:13.137
Yeah, it's a good point.

11
00:01:13.241 --> 00:01:14.241
Okay.

12
00:01:27.965 --> 00:01:29.931
- What'd you wish for?
- I don't want to say!

13
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.793
- What?! Why not?
- 'Cause it's embarrassing.

14
00:01:31.896 --> 00:01:33.793
More embarrassing
than wishing you could dye

15
00:01:33.896 --> 00:01:35.896
your hair pink for prom?
Uh, no, yeah,

16
00:01:35.931 --> 00:01:38.206
I think this is actually
more embarrassing than that.

17
00:01:38.965 --> 00:01:40.965
Okay, we'll say it
at the same time then.

18
00:01:41.068 --> 00:01:42.758
On the count of three. Come on.
Okay.

19
00:01:42.862 --> 00:01:44.551
Okay? One...

20
00:01:45.034 --> 00:01:46.586
two, three!

21
00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:48.517
I wish to meet my soulmate.

22
00:01:50.068 --> 00:01:51.620
What? Actually?

23
00:01:51.724 --> 00:01:53.896
Oh my gosh. No way!

24
00:01:53.965 --> 00:01:56.206
I cannot believe that
we made the exact...

25
00:01:56.241 --> 00:01:57.793
same wish.

26
00:01:58.586 --> 00:02:01.137
After all these years,
we're still so connected.

27
00:02:01.206 --> 00:02:02.965
Even living far apart.

28
00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:06.482
I really miss you.

29
00:02:06.517 --> 00:02:07.931
It's hard being away from you.

30
00:02:07.965 --> 00:02:10.344
And Mom and Dad, I guess.

31
00:02:11.275 --> 00:02:14.724
At least we know that
every year, no matter what,

32
00:02:14.827 --> 00:02:16.965
we're both coming home
for Christmas.

33
00:02:17.724 --> 00:02:19.620
- You promise?
- Promise.

34
00:02:21.931 --> 00:02:23.068
Oh!

35
00:02:26.137 --> 00:02:27.137
'Kay, let's wish.

36
00:03:04.172 --> 00:03:05.827
Are you kidding me?

37
00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:18.172
Wait! Wait!

38
00:03:19.103 --> 00:03:20.827
Uh...

39
00:03:20.862 --> 00:03:22.827
Um, how much for the car?

40
00:03:22.862 --> 00:03:24.724
Uh, sorry?

41
00:03:24.793 --> 00:03:26.724
The car. How much
do you want for it?

42
00:03:26.793 --> 00:03:28.724
Yeah, I don't think that's
how it works.

43
00:03:28.793 --> 00:03:31.517
No. Please.
You don't understand.

44
00:03:31.551 --> 00:03:33.344
My sister is getting married

45
00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:35.896
and her wedding dress
fitting is this afternoon.

46
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
I need to be there
and you literally

47
00:03:38.034 --> 00:03:39.689
hold the keys to that happening.

48
00:03:39.724 --> 00:03:42.034
- Where are you headed?
- New York City.

49
00:03:42.862 --> 00:03:45.044
Okay, well, it just so happens
that I'm headed there too.

50
00:03:45.068 --> 00:03:46.413
Can I come?

51
00:03:46.517 --> 00:03:47.827
You're willing to ride

52
00:03:47.862 --> 00:03:50.379
in a car with a stranger
for hours

53
00:03:50.413 --> 00:03:52.103
just to go to a dress fitting?

54
00:03:52.206 --> 00:03:54.551
Yeah, I would do anything
for my sister.

55
00:03:54.586 --> 00:03:57.758
And Christmas has kind of always
been our special time together.

56
00:03:57.862 --> 00:04:00.620
And I really don't want
to miss a second of it.

57
00:04:01.344 --> 00:04:03.965
Please.
Okay.

58
00:04:04.068 --> 00:04:05.724
You can ride in the car
with me...

59
00:04:05.758 --> 00:04:08.172
But, but, but...

60
00:04:08.275 --> 00:04:09.793
On one condition.

61
00:04:09.862 --> 00:04:11.320
Now, I know it's gonna sound
a little lame,

62
00:04:11.344 --> 00:04:13.862
but I'm planning on listening
to the Central Park Caroller's

63
00:04:13.965 --> 00:04:16.758
Christmas album
until we get there, on a loop,

64
00:04:16.793 --> 00:04:18.586
so you have to be
okay with that.

65
00:04:19.172 --> 00:04:21.931
I love the Central Park
Carollers.

66
00:04:24.862 --> 00:04:28.068
What... really? Most people
haven't even heard of them.

67
00:04:29.068 --> 00:04:30.655
I'm Cara.

68
00:04:31.103 --> 00:04:32.103
Chace.

69
00:04:32.827 --> 00:04:34.965
Wow. Um...
Did you make this?

70
00:04:35.068 --> 00:04:37.172
It is... I did.
It's hand-made.

71
00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:40.275
I know, I know. Here,
let me get your bags.

72
00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:41.448
Oh. Thanks.

73
00:04:50.103 --> 00:04:52.827
So, there we are racing
all over town.

74
00:04:52.931 --> 00:04:56.586
The clock is ticking.
It is starting to look dire.

75
00:04:57.793 --> 00:05:00.344
So, in a moment
of sheer desperation,

76
00:05:00.448 --> 00:05:02.665
we end up getting a tree from
one of those street vendors.

77
00:05:02.689 --> 00:05:05.896
Total Charlie Brown moment.

78
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.137
That's why you gotta go
to the 34th Street lot.

79
00:05:08.172 --> 00:05:10.310
Oh, trust me, I'm never making
that mistake again.

80
00:05:12.172 --> 00:05:15.827
Well, I guess this is
goodbye then.

81
00:05:16.379 --> 00:05:18.034
- Yeah.
- I gotta say,

82
00:05:18.137 --> 00:05:20.010
that felt like the fastest
six hours of my life.

83
00:05:20.034 --> 00:05:22.689
I was thinking
the exact same thing.

84
00:05:23.827 --> 00:05:26.103
And I can't believe you
and your sister

85
00:05:26.206 --> 00:05:28.586
go to the riverside snowman
building contest every year

86
00:05:28.689 --> 00:05:31.034
and that we...
Never run into each other.

87
00:05:31.137 --> 00:05:32.482
Yeah!

88
00:05:32.517 --> 00:05:35.000
I would have remembered you.

89
00:05:36.413 --> 00:05:39.482
Uh, speaking of our many

90
00:05:39.517 --> 00:05:41.000
common interests...

91
00:05:42.172 --> 00:05:45.379
I'm planning on hitting up
Pete's Cafe for the...

92
00:05:45.482 --> 00:05:46.827
Peppermint hot cocoa.

93
00:05:46.896 --> 00:05:50.172
Yes. Yeah.
And I was hoping,

94
00:05:50.241 --> 00:05:52.137
maybe I'd see you there.

95
00:05:53.241 --> 00:05:54.517
Absolutely.

96
00:05:55.172 --> 00:05:58.000
Okay. Great. Um...
Take my number.

97
00:05:58.862 --> 00:06:01.448
Text me and we...

98
00:06:02.517 --> 00:06:03.965
will make a plan.

99
00:06:07.413 --> 00:06:10.379
Okay. Say congrats to
your sister for me.

100
00:06:11.586 --> 00:06:12.896
I will.

101
00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:15.413
The wedding's on the 24th.

102
00:06:15.482 --> 00:06:18.586
I know this is crazy,
but I don't have a date.

103
00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:20.586
And we just got along
so well and so...

104
00:06:20.689 --> 00:06:22.344
- I'd love to.
- Really?

105
00:06:22.379 --> 00:06:23.689
Yeah. Yes.

106
00:06:23.758 --> 00:06:25.872
Just to clarify, I'm asking
you to my sister's wedding

107
00:06:25.896 --> 00:06:28.586
as my date.
Yeah. I got that.

108
00:06:28.689 --> 00:06:30.275
Okay. Cool.

109
00:06:30.379 --> 00:06:34.068
Well, I'll text you 'cause...
I've got your number now.

110
00:06:34.413 --> 00:06:36.000
Okay. Uh...

111
00:06:37.931 --> 00:06:39.448
I'm glad I met you, Cara.

112
00:06:56.965 --> 00:07:00.034
I am so sorry!

113
00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:03.586
No!

114
00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:04.965
What?

115
00:07:05.862 --> 00:07:08.172
You just kicked my phone
into the sewer!

116
00:07:09.586 --> 00:07:11.137
- I did?
- Yes!

117
00:07:11.172 --> 00:07:13.482
What was your phone doing in
the middle of the sidewalk?

118
00:07:14.103 --> 00:07:17.241
I was twirling and then
I dropped it, okay?

119
00:07:17.896 --> 00:07:19.517
You were twirling?

120
00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:21.103
Doesn't matter, now it's gone.

121
00:07:21.137 --> 00:07:23.689
Well... look.
Maybe we can still...

122
00:07:26.655 --> 00:07:27.965
Yeah. It's gone.

123
00:07:28.448 --> 00:07:29.931
Of course it is.

124
00:07:31.689 --> 00:07:33.068
Thanks a lot!

125
00:07:33.793 --> 00:07:34.827
Uh...

126
00:07:46.275 --> 00:07:49.137
Amy! I'm here!
I'm sorry I'm late.

127
00:07:49.172 --> 00:07:51.310
Oh, that's okay. I'm just
really glad you're here.

128
00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:00.896
You hate it? I knew it!

129
00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.379
I knew it. Is it...

130
00:08:05.586 --> 00:08:07.034
Amy, you're perfect.

131
00:08:08.517 --> 00:08:10.655
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

132
00:08:13.793 --> 00:08:15.379
Yeah, I guess
it's not bad, huh?

133
00:08:16.793 --> 00:08:20.758
Oh, okay, I'm really, really
happy that you're here.

134
00:08:20.862 --> 00:08:21.862
Have I said that?

135
00:08:21.896 --> 00:08:23.256
I wouldn't miss it
for the world.

136
00:08:24.724 --> 00:08:26.241
Although I almost did.

137
00:08:26.344 --> 00:08:27.344
What?

138
00:08:30.862 --> 00:08:32.448
So anyway, wow.

139
00:08:32.551 --> 00:08:35.689
Now the phone's gone and I have
no way of contacting him.

140
00:08:35.758 --> 00:08:37.551
- Huh?
- Yeah.

141
00:08:37.586 --> 00:08:40.344
Which kind of stinks
because I sort of invited him

142
00:08:40.379 --> 00:08:41.379
to your wedding.

143
00:08:41.482 --> 00:08:43.068
Uh, you what?

144
00:08:44.034 --> 00:08:45.724
- I know.
- How?

145
00:08:45.793 --> 00:08:47.241
- Well you don't understand...
- Oh!

146
00:08:47.344 --> 00:08:49.482
The connection! It was...
magical!

147
00:08:50.379 --> 00:08:51.689
Wow, Cara!

148
00:08:52.241 --> 00:08:53.241
Wow.

149
00:08:59.379 --> 00:09:02.206
Chace loved these cookies.
Oh yeah?

150
00:09:02.827 --> 00:09:04.137
That's it.

151
00:09:07.172 --> 00:09:10.068
What, you're gonna leave
a trail of shortbread crumbs

152
00:09:10.103 --> 00:09:11.931
so that he can find his
way back to you?

153
00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:13.448
Yeah, kinda.

154
00:09:13.482 --> 00:09:15.827
If we just go to all of
our usual Christmas spots,

155
00:09:15.931 --> 00:09:17.620
I'm bound to run into him
eventually.

156
00:09:18.241 --> 00:09:20.275
Um, okay, right.

157
00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:22.586
I've been meaning to talk
to you about that.

158
00:09:23.931 --> 00:09:24.965
I can't come with you.

159
00:09:25.448 --> 00:09:27.689
It's just,
with the wedding coming up,

160
00:09:27.793 --> 00:09:30.344
I have so much on my plate
and I...

161
00:09:30.448 --> 00:09:32.275
Oh, please don't be mad...
No.

162
00:09:32.344 --> 00:09:34.793
- I'm so sorry.
- No. I'm not mad.

163
00:09:34.896 --> 00:09:36.068
Of course I'm not mad.

164
00:09:36.103 --> 00:09:37.758
This is your wedding
we're talking about.

165
00:09:38.413 --> 00:09:40.931
And I'm here to help.
Whatever you need.

166
00:09:40.965 --> 00:09:42.172
Thanks.

167
00:09:42.793 --> 00:09:44.044
But hey, this shouldn't
stop you.

168
00:09:44.068 --> 00:09:47.000
I mean, if Chace
is your soulmate,

169
00:09:47.103 --> 00:09:48.758
you gotta find him.

170
00:09:49.586 --> 00:09:51.068
I'll make a list
of all our spots.

171
00:09:51.103 --> 00:09:52.620
There she goes.

172
00:09:53.275 --> 00:09:54.551
Chace.

173
00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:01.655
Michael.

174
00:10:02.482 --> 00:10:04.448
You know we can't publish
this, right?

175
00:10:05.103 --> 00:10:06.793
Why not?

176
00:10:06.862 --> 00:10:09.103
I feel like it's some
of my best work.

177
00:10:09.137 --> 00:10:11.413
Well no one's saying
it's not good,

178
00:10:12.103 --> 00:10:13.655
but it just wasn't
the assignment.

179
00:10:13.758 --> 00:10:15.965
Do you really think
that people want to read

180
00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:17.965
and entire article on why
New York's pizza's

181
00:10:18.068 --> 00:10:19.310
better than Chicago's?

182
00:10:19.413 --> 00:10:21.241
This... this has heart,
and history,

183
00:10:21.275 --> 00:10:23.068
and drama, and intrigue!

184
00:10:23.103 --> 00:10:25.551
Like... isn't that what people
want to read?

185
00:10:25.586 --> 00:10:26.724
No. Look.

186
00:10:26.827 --> 00:10:30.344
You're a great writer.
Probably the best we have.

187
00:10:30.448 --> 00:10:34.137
But you have to learn to write
within our parameters.

188
00:10:34.241 --> 00:10:36.724
No more think pieces.
Okay.

189
00:10:36.758 --> 00:10:38.034
What've you got for me?

190
00:10:39.275 --> 00:10:41.137
- It's a top ten list.
- No.

191
00:10:41.241 --> 00:10:42.344
- Michael!
- Okay, fine.

192
00:10:42.448 --> 00:10:44.482
Yeah, yeah. Top ten. I love it.

193
00:10:44.586 --> 00:10:48.103
Okay. What are we talking, huh?
Best bagels in Brooklyn?

194
00:10:48.793 --> 00:10:50.758
Martinis in Manhattan?

195
00:10:50.793 --> 00:10:52.862
It's about Christmas
in New York.

196
00:10:52.965 --> 00:10:56.275
You know I haven't spent
Christmas in the city in years.

197
00:10:56.310 --> 00:10:58.620
I need you to prove to me
that you can do this

198
00:10:58.655 --> 00:11:02.655
or that's a conversation
I don't want to have with you.

199
00:11:02.689 --> 00:11:03.689
Fine.

200
00:11:04.827 --> 00:11:06.310
Christmas in New York.

201
00:11:16.517 --> 00:11:18.862
- Morning, Mom.
- Morning sweetheart.

202
00:11:18.965 --> 00:11:20.896
How'd you sleep?
Like a baby.

203
00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:22.379
Mom!

204
00:11:22.482 --> 00:11:24.310
Mom. Emergency.

205
00:11:24.344 --> 00:11:26.000
Our dance instructor
broke her leg skiing.

206
00:11:26.068 --> 00:11:27.827
Who's gonna choreograph
our first dance?

207
00:11:27.896 --> 00:11:29.517
Um, don't panic.

208
00:11:29.551 --> 00:11:32.517
Mrs. Gardener, who lives down
the street, teaches Zumba.

209
00:11:33.517 --> 00:11:35.689
Trust me, she is phenomenal.

210
00:11:35.758 --> 00:11:38.034
Okay, Mrs. Gardener,
I'll put that in the maybe pile.

211
00:11:40.379 --> 00:11:41.655
- Bad news.
- What?

212
00:11:41.689 --> 00:11:43.562
- My parent's flight is delayed.
- But the fitting.

213
00:11:43.586 --> 00:11:44.941
Don't worry,
I've already rescheduled.

214
00:11:44.965 --> 00:11:46.000
What about the tasting?

215
00:11:46.034 --> 00:11:47.320
We don't need them
for the tasting.

216
00:11:47.344 --> 00:11:49.144
Besides, you know my Dad's idea
of fine dining

217
00:11:49.172 --> 00:11:50.700
is pigs in a blanket
dipped in grainy mustard.

218
00:11:50.724 --> 00:11:53.206
Yeah, you're right.
He has terrible taste.

219
00:11:53.862 --> 00:11:55.586
And how did you sleep,
sugar plum?

220
00:11:55.689 --> 00:11:58.068
- Like a baby.
- I'll just have to try one...

221
00:11:58.172 --> 00:12:00.896
Gary. How many times
do I have to tell you,

222
00:12:00.965 --> 00:12:03.655
these are for Chris' parents.

223
00:12:03.758 --> 00:12:06.448
Who, by the way, you have to
pick up at the airport at...

224
00:12:06.551 --> 00:12:08.965
what time, Chris?
Uh, tomorrow. 3:45.

225
00:12:09.068 --> 00:12:10.620
Ooh, before I forget, Cara,

226
00:12:10.724 --> 00:12:12.758
how are the monogram
and menu designs coming?

227
00:12:12.793 --> 00:12:15.241
They're going great.
In fact, I was thinking

228
00:12:15.275 --> 00:12:17.113
I would head to Pete's Cafe
to work on them today.

229
00:12:17.137 --> 00:12:19.241
Pete's Cafe, huh?
Hoping to run into

230
00:12:19.275 --> 00:12:20.758
Mr. Chace, are we?

231
00:12:20.862 --> 00:12:22.517
Chace? Who's Chace?

232
00:12:22.551 --> 00:12:23.551
He's no one.

233
00:12:23.586 --> 00:12:25.448
Ooh, does somebody
have a date?

234
00:12:25.551 --> 00:12:27.241
Is he your boyfriend?

235
00:12:27.275 --> 00:12:29.206
Okay, I am leaving now.

236
00:12:31.413 --> 00:12:33.724
Love you.
Love you too.

237
00:12:33.758 --> 00:12:36.413
Okay, this dough needs help.

238
00:12:36.896 --> 00:12:38.379
Would you please pack
the cookies?

239
00:12:38.448 --> 00:12:39.448
Okay.

240
00:12:42.068 --> 00:12:43.517
- Oh well.
- Gary!

241
00:12:43.896 --> 00:12:45.344
I can see you.

242
00:13:17.275 --> 00:13:18.586
Another round?

243
00:13:19.965 --> 00:13:21.310
Make it a double.

244
00:13:23.137 --> 00:13:24.965
No sign of him, huh?

245
00:13:28.827 --> 00:13:30.482
Wow, that's pretty good.

246
00:13:30.551 --> 00:13:33.000
Are you an artist?
Uh, graphic designer.

247
00:13:33.482 --> 00:13:36.310
Well actually I'm not.
I wish I was though.

248
00:13:37.068 --> 00:13:38.482
It's a competitive field.

249
00:13:38.517 --> 00:13:40.827
Well then, start competing.

250
00:13:40.862 --> 00:13:44.241
And I'll go pick up your double
peppermint hot cocoa.

251
00:13:50.965 --> 00:13:52.862
What's the assignment this week,
Ace?

252
00:13:53.517 --> 00:13:54.931
It's a top ten list.

253
00:13:56.793 --> 00:14:01.241
New York's top ten hidden gems,
Christmas edition.

254
00:14:01.344 --> 00:14:03.413
Yikes. No offence,

255
00:14:03.517 --> 00:14:05.355
but couldn't they find anyone
who was more qualified?

256
00:14:05.379 --> 00:14:08.862
Right? Now I have to cancel
my flight and actually

257
00:14:08.896 --> 00:14:10.103
spend Christmas here.

258
00:14:10.758 --> 00:14:12.551
Exhausted just thinking
about it.

259
00:14:12.620 --> 00:14:16.275
Okay. Sounds like you can use
a double shot,

260
00:14:16.379 --> 00:14:18.517
double whipped cream,
candy cane eggnog latte?

261
00:14:20.689 --> 00:14:23.344
I'll get you your regular.
You're no fun.

262
00:14:26.413 --> 00:14:28.862
For you.
Thanks, Pete.

263
00:14:29.620 --> 00:14:32.655
You know you really should try
one of his seasonal drinks...

264
00:14:32.689 --> 00:14:33.689
You?

265
00:14:34.551 --> 00:14:37.310
Phone girl.

266
00:14:38.379 --> 00:14:40.000
What are you doing here?

267
00:14:41.103 --> 00:14:44.551
Uh, I'm... working.
Having coffee.

268
00:14:44.586 --> 00:14:46.172
Hanging out with my buddy Pete.

269
00:14:46.206 --> 00:14:49.724
Um, I'm actually glad
I ran into you here.

270
00:14:49.793 --> 00:14:51.379
I feel really bad
about what happened,

271
00:14:51.413 --> 00:14:54.551
can I buy you a coffee,
make it up to you?

272
00:14:55.827 --> 00:14:58.034
Yeah, I guess
that would be okay.

273
00:14:58.586 --> 00:15:00.275
Uh, I can also replace
the phone.

274
00:15:00.379 --> 00:15:02.965
No, I bought a new phone.

275
00:15:03.034 --> 00:15:05.724
It's the contents of the phone
that can't be replaced.

276
00:15:06.241 --> 00:15:07.586
They're irreplaceable.

277
00:15:07.620 --> 00:15:10.793
Hold on. You mean to tell me
that Michael is the one

278
00:15:10.827 --> 00:15:13.068
who kicked your phone
into the sewer?

279
00:15:13.103 --> 00:15:14.620
Okay, how'd you know
about that?

280
00:15:14.689 --> 00:15:16.517
Okay, I know about everything.

281
00:15:16.620 --> 00:15:18.793
You sir, may have lost
this woman her soulmate.

282
00:15:18.896 --> 00:15:20.620
Wait, what?

283
00:15:22.862 --> 00:15:25.310
- So there's this guy...
- There's always a guy.

284
00:15:25.413 --> 00:15:27.620
We met yesterday
and we drove from Pittsburgh

285
00:15:27.655 --> 00:15:29.620
to New York together
and I am not being dramatic

286
00:15:29.689 --> 00:15:31.931
when I say that he's the one.

287
00:15:31.965 --> 00:15:34.448
She even invited him
to her sister's wedding.

288
00:15:35.034 --> 00:15:37.620
- After knowing him for one day.
- You don't understand.

289
00:15:37.724 --> 00:15:40.172
We connected on every level.

290
00:15:40.275 --> 00:15:43.620
But every year, they do the
same niche Christmas activities.

291
00:15:44.344 --> 00:15:45.838
I was hoping
that I was gonna see him

292
00:15:45.862 --> 00:15:48.068
at the riverside snowman
building contest tomorrow.

293
00:15:48.931 --> 00:15:50.586
You need a partner.

294
00:15:53.103 --> 00:15:55.758
Don't have any family and
friends that could go with you?

295
00:15:55.827 --> 00:15:57.068
No.

296
00:15:57.103 --> 00:15:58.907
Most of my friends have
gone home for the holidays

297
00:15:58.931 --> 00:16:00.517
and my family is
completely wrapped up

298
00:16:00.620 --> 00:16:03.965
with my sister's wedding.
Which, of course, but...

299
00:16:06.344 --> 00:16:07.965
Well, that's tough.

300
00:16:08.344 --> 00:16:09.827
Michael will go with you.

301
00:16:12.379 --> 00:16:15.137
- I'm sorry, what?
- You kind of owe her.

302
00:16:15.172 --> 00:16:17.517
Oh, no, it's okay.

303
00:16:17.586 --> 00:16:19.344
Hear me out. Michael here is

304
00:16:19.413 --> 00:16:21.137
a writer who is currently
doing an article

305
00:16:21.172 --> 00:16:22.551
about Christmas in New York.

306
00:16:22.655 --> 00:16:24.965
Which he knows nothing about,
seeing as how he's avoided

307
00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:26.596
Christmas in the city
for the last ten years

308
00:16:26.620 --> 00:16:28.310
by fleeing to Aruba.

309
00:16:28.827 --> 00:16:31.413
And you're
a Christmas enthusiast

310
00:16:31.517 --> 00:16:33.827
who needs a partner for
a snowman building contest

311
00:16:33.896 --> 00:16:35.655
so you can find the love
of your life.

312
00:16:35.689 --> 00:16:37.000
You see what I'm getting at?

313
00:16:40.517 --> 00:16:42.034
Can you excuse us
for a moment?

314
00:16:42.827 --> 00:16:44.000
Yeah.

315
00:16:48.689 --> 00:16:50.827
P- What are you doing?
No, what are you doing?

316
00:16:50.862 --> 00:16:52.689
You should be jumping
at this opportunity.

317
00:16:52.758 --> 00:16:54.655
She could basically write
the article for you.

318
00:16:54.689 --> 00:16:57.586
- Yeah, but she...
- Look, you can't afford

319
00:16:57.689 --> 00:17:00.000
to lose this job.
And you know diddly-squat

320
00:17:00.068 --> 00:17:01.586
about Christmas in the city.

321
00:17:01.620 --> 00:17:04.551
The universe is handing you
everything you need.

322
00:17:06.379 --> 00:17:07.551
Cara!

323
00:17:15.724 --> 00:17:17.931
So?

324
00:17:19.068 --> 00:17:20.103
I'm in.

325
00:17:21.206 --> 00:17:22.896
Snowman building contest.

326
00:17:23.793 --> 00:17:25.724
As long as I can come along
to all the other...

327
00:17:25.793 --> 00:17:28.241
activities for the article.

328
00:17:28.931 --> 00:17:32.068
Okay. I'm just not exactly
sure what I'm getting

329
00:17:32.137 --> 00:17:33.344
out of all of this.

330
00:17:33.448 --> 00:17:35.965
Cara here is a budding graphic
designer who needs an in.

331
00:17:36.068 --> 00:17:38.965
And I happen to know that
Michael is good friends

332
00:17:39.068 --> 00:17:41.068
with the editor
of Evergreen Graphics.

333
00:17:41.137 --> 00:17:42.896
Evergreen Graphics?

334
00:17:42.931 --> 00:17:45.206
That's the best firm
in the city.

335
00:17:45.241 --> 00:17:47.517
Wait. You can make
a connection, can't you Mike?

336
00:17:47.551 --> 00:17:49.034
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

337
00:17:49.724 --> 00:17:52.172
I can.
Uh, cool.

338
00:17:53.965 --> 00:17:56.965
See you tomorrow,
Riverside Park, 2PM?

339
00:17:58.275 --> 00:17:59.689
That'll be three-fifty.

340
00:18:00.034 --> 00:18:01.620
That'll be three-fifty.

341
00:18:04.793 --> 00:18:05.965
Yeah.

342
00:18:06.310 --> 00:18:07.655
No problem.
See you tomorrow.

343
00:18:07.758 --> 00:18:09.103
- Okay.
- Bye Pete.

344
00:18:09.137 --> 00:18:10.137
- Bye.
- Bye.

345
00:18:12.517 --> 00:18:14.655
Ellen, Patrick, okay.

346
00:18:14.689 --> 00:18:16.793
Okay, we are making progress,
right?

347
00:18:16.862 --> 00:18:18.551
- Yes.
- I think we really are.

348
00:18:18.655 --> 00:18:20.344
- Yes.
- And we just have to...

349
00:18:20.448 --> 00:18:22.517
Janice! Okay... hmm.

350
00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:24.655
Now, I can't put aunt Janice
next to cousin Joey

351
00:18:24.689 --> 00:18:26.482
after the volleyball incident,
2018.

352
00:18:26.517 --> 00:18:29.827
- Definitely not.
- So, where do I put Janice?

353
00:18:30.793 --> 00:18:32.753
We got another late RSVP
from your uncle George.

354
00:18:32.793 --> 00:18:34.448
Ugh! That throws
everything off!

355
00:18:36.206 --> 00:18:37.827
Why don't we put...

356
00:18:38.620 --> 00:18:40.758
Ted next to Felicia.

357
00:18:42.137 --> 00:18:45.517
George next to Margot.

358
00:18:45.620 --> 00:18:49.172
And Joey all the way
over here next to Liane?

359
00:18:49.620 --> 00:18:51.286
You know they'll just talk
each other's ears off

360
00:18:51.310 --> 00:18:52.310
about their love of...

361
00:18:52.379 --> 00:18:53.482
building
model airplanes.

362
00:18:54.689 --> 00:18:56.758
Oh my gosh, okay,
this makes sense.

363
00:18:56.793 --> 00:18:59.172
What would I do without you?

364
00:18:59.689 --> 00:19:01.793
- I don't know.
- Stop!

365
00:19:01.896 --> 00:19:04.448
You guys are too cute for
my single heart to handle.

366
00:19:04.551 --> 00:19:07.044
Well I thought you were bringing
your soulmate to the wedding, no?

367
00:19:07.068 --> 00:19:09.068
He's even got a pin
on the chart.

368
00:19:09.172 --> 00:19:10.172
Yeah, he's right there.

369
00:19:10.275 --> 00:19:12.206
Okay, let's not get
ahead of ourselves,

370
00:19:12.241 --> 00:19:13.517
I still have to find him.

371
00:19:13.551 --> 00:19:15.034
How's the search going,
anyways?

372
00:19:15.068 --> 00:19:16.448
Well, he wasn't
at Pete's today.

373
00:19:16.551 --> 00:19:19.724
But I did manage to find myself
a partner for tomorrow.

374
00:19:19.758 --> 00:19:21.206
So, hopefully
I'll see him there.

375
00:19:21.241 --> 00:19:22.896
A partner? Who?

376
00:19:22.931 --> 00:19:24.931
It's kind of a long story,
but this guy Michael

377
00:19:25.034 --> 00:19:26.862
wants to tag along,
he's writing some article

378
00:19:26.931 --> 00:19:28.379
about Christmas in New York.

379
00:19:28.448 --> 00:19:30.896
So you're just gonna build a
snowman with a total stranger?

380
00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:33.206
A girl's gotta do what
a girl's gotta do.

381
00:19:33.275 --> 00:19:35.620
Besides, if we don't find him,

382
00:19:35.724 --> 00:19:37.586
your entire seating plan
will be off.

383
00:19:37.689 --> 00:19:39.169
Oh, well we can't have that,
can we?

384
00:19:39.206 --> 00:19:40.241
No, no, no, we can't.

385
00:19:40.344 --> 00:19:41.620
Thank you so much Gladys,

386
00:19:41.724 --> 00:19:44.758
you're an absolute doll.
Yeah, I can't wait to tell them.

387
00:19:45.655 --> 00:19:47.896
Tata. Well, great news.

388
00:19:47.965 --> 00:19:50.620
Mrs. Gardener is happy to be
your new dance coach.

389
00:19:50.724 --> 00:19:53.172
Aw, that's so great Ma.
Thanks.

390
00:19:53.206 --> 00:19:56.068
Oh. Before I forget,
did you manage to call

391
00:19:56.172 --> 00:19:57.344
Ruby's about the cake?

392
00:19:57.379 --> 00:19:59.172
Yes. Uh, they said it will be

393
00:19:59.206 --> 00:20:00.620
ready in a couple of days.

394
00:20:00.724 --> 00:20:02.251
But of course, I also have
to get my mani-pedi

395
00:20:02.275 --> 00:20:04.620
and I have to pick up my dress
and I have to have

396
00:20:04.724 --> 00:20:06.551
the final menu meeting
with the caterer.

397
00:20:06.586 --> 00:20:08.862
Ah, Chris, because you're
a scientist,

398
00:20:08.896 --> 00:20:10.931
can you build me
a time machine please?

399
00:20:11.034 --> 00:20:13.620
Sorry babe, I don't think
they have that technology yet.

400
00:20:13.724 --> 00:20:17.586
Also, I'm a biologist,
so it's not really what I do.

401
00:20:17.689 --> 00:20:19.241
Okay. Then what good are you?

402
00:20:19.344 --> 00:20:21.010
Well, I'm pretty good
at the seating charts.

403
00:20:21.034 --> 00:20:22.862
That's true.
I guess I have to keep you.

404
00:20:22.896 --> 00:20:25.517
- I guess you do.
- Uh, I can pick it up for you.

405
00:20:25.551 --> 00:20:27.137
- Actually?
- Yeah.

406
00:20:27.241 --> 00:20:29.601
Thank you. It is a three-
tiered gingerbread wedding cake,

407
00:20:29.689 --> 00:20:31.976
the one that I've been dreaming
about since I was a little girl.

408
00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.344
Yeah. You've talked about it
a few times.

409
00:20:44.689 --> 00:20:47.241
Hey.
Hey.

410
00:20:47.344 --> 00:20:49.172
Can't believe you showed up.

411
00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:52.310
That was the plan, right?

412
00:20:53.206 --> 00:20:55.862
Yeah, I just really didn't
think you'd come.

413
00:20:56.724 --> 00:20:59.000
I do have an article
to write, so...

414
00:20:59.620 --> 00:21:01.620
Yeah, no, I know.

415
00:21:02.931 --> 00:21:04.620
I'm glad you're here.

416
00:21:05.620 --> 00:21:08.758
Yeah, I'm glad I came too.

417
00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:14.068
- I guess we should...
- Uh, yeah.

418
00:21:16.482 --> 00:21:17.724
Hi.

419
00:21:18.413 --> 00:21:20.413
Sorry, you... you go.

420
00:21:26.482 --> 00:21:28.241
Do you wanna put that away?

421
00:21:30.241 --> 00:21:31.724
Yeah. Sure.

422
00:21:32.586 --> 00:21:35.793
Wow. This is no joke.

423
00:21:37.793 --> 00:21:40.310
Yeah, it's serious business.
People go all out.

424
00:21:40.413 --> 00:21:41.724
Yeah.

425
00:21:43.724 --> 00:21:45.034
Hi, Nadine.

426
00:21:45.827 --> 00:21:47.620
Looking good, as usual.

427
00:21:48.793 --> 00:21:50.172
She is so smug.

428
00:21:50.275 --> 00:21:52.275
She thinks she's all that
just because she minored

429
00:21:52.310 --> 00:21:54.620
in Art History.

430
00:21:56.862 --> 00:21:58.941
Isn't this supposed to be
a two-person competition?

431
00:21:58.965 --> 00:22:00.931
Yeah, that's the other thing.
Every year,

432
00:22:00.965 --> 00:22:03.724
she sends her partner
to go get hot chocolate,

433
00:22:03.827 --> 00:22:05.000
and then they never come back

434
00:22:05.068 --> 00:22:06.517
and she does
the whole thing herself.

435
00:22:07.655 --> 00:22:09.448
Okay. This looks like the spot.

436
00:22:10.137 --> 00:22:11.137
Great.

437
00:22:17.896 --> 00:22:20.482
Okay, I'm getting down.

438
00:22:21.413 --> 00:22:25.000
So...
Time to mitten up.

439
00:22:25.034 --> 00:22:26.310
Okay.

440
00:22:27.344 --> 00:22:28.896
Where are your mittens?

441
00:22:29.965 --> 00:22:31.620
I have my gloves.

442
00:22:32.586 --> 00:22:36.137
You wore fingerless gloves
to a snowman building contest?

443
00:22:36.517 --> 00:22:37.655
It's all I have.

444
00:22:38.137 --> 00:22:40.034
And they're great
for taking notes.

445
00:22:40.068 --> 00:22:42.172
You can't build a snowman
with fingerless gloves,

446
00:22:42.241 --> 00:22:43.379
you'll get frostbite.

447
00:22:46.793 --> 00:22:48.448
You should put that
in your article.

448
00:22:50.655 --> 00:22:53.206
I'll be fine.

449
00:22:53.310 --> 00:22:54.827
Okay.

450
00:23:10.034 --> 00:23:12.517
I like him. He's got character.

451
00:23:13.413 --> 00:23:15.931
Might as well just hand
the prize to Nadine.

452
00:23:16.034 --> 00:23:18.965
Hey, don't go giving up
so easy.

453
00:23:19.068 --> 00:23:21.172
Ours can't be the worst one.

454
00:23:21.931 --> 00:23:23.275
Check out the competition.

455
00:23:28.793 --> 00:23:29.793
What?

456
00:23:30.379 --> 00:23:32.551
What are you looking at?
That's his scarf.

457
00:23:33.862 --> 00:23:34.965
- Really?
- Yeah!

458
00:23:35.068 --> 00:23:36.896
How many people do you
know that would wear

459
00:23:36.965 --> 00:23:38.896
a red checkered snowman scarf?

460
00:23:39.620 --> 00:23:40.758
We're on the right track.

461
00:23:40.793 --> 00:23:43.103
I just know we're gonna find him
on the next one.

462
00:23:44.241 --> 00:23:47.413
Michael, please find attached
my portfolio,

463
00:23:47.482 --> 00:23:49.137
I know I don't have much but...

464
00:23:49.965 --> 00:23:54.241
I hope that what I do have
speaks for itself.

465
00:23:54.275 --> 00:23:55.379
See you tomorrow.

466
00:23:55.482 --> 00:23:59.275
Hey. Mom and Dad just left
for the Nutcracker.

467
00:23:59.896 --> 00:24:01.448
Let's do this.

468
00:24:08.827 --> 00:24:10.862
Okay, I have to remember
which ones

469
00:24:10.965 --> 00:24:12.493
I've actually wrapped already
and which ones

470
00:24:12.517 --> 00:24:15.103
I still have to finish. Um...

471
00:24:15.551 --> 00:24:17.620
How fast can we do it?

472
00:24:19.344 --> 00:24:21.000
Where are your
Christmas pajamas?

473
00:24:21.068 --> 00:24:24.344
Oh, yeah, no, Chris got me
these for my birthday.

474
00:24:25.034 --> 00:24:26.655
Aren't they nice?

475
00:24:26.689 --> 00:24:29.655
Yeah, it's just, we always
wear matching PJs at Christmas.

476
00:24:29.758 --> 00:24:31.517
Um, no, I know.

477
00:24:31.620 --> 00:24:34.000
I guess I just thought these
were a little bit more me.

478
00:24:34.655 --> 00:24:36.413
Yeah. They're great.

479
00:24:37.655 --> 00:24:38.793
I'm kind of jealous.

480
00:24:38.827 --> 00:24:40.586
You can borrow them.

481
00:24:47.965 --> 00:24:51.103
It's kind of wild to think
it was just a year ago

482
00:24:51.137 --> 00:24:52.793
that we made the wish.

483
00:24:52.862 --> 00:24:54.862
A lot has changed in a year.

484
00:24:54.965 --> 00:24:57.482
Mm-hmm.

485
00:24:57.551 --> 00:24:59.000
It really has.

486
00:24:59.103 --> 00:25:01.689
Can I tell you a secret?
Mmhmm.

487
00:25:01.758 --> 00:25:05.379
Um, when I made the wish,

488
00:25:06.586 --> 00:25:08.172
I wasn't picturing Chris.

489
00:25:08.206 --> 00:25:10.103
What were you picturing?

490
00:25:10.793 --> 00:25:13.344
I don't know,
somebody more like me,

491
00:25:13.379 --> 00:25:16.000
somebody more like the guys
I dated in the past.

492
00:25:16.586 --> 00:25:18.310
I know, um...

493
00:25:19.655 --> 00:25:21.689
And then Chris came along and...

494
00:25:23.758 --> 00:25:27.000
It just sort of worked,
you know?

495
00:25:28.862 --> 00:25:30.413
You guys are really great
together.

496
00:25:32.206 --> 00:25:33.586
I like to think so.

497
00:25:36.379 --> 00:25:39.068
I think you should make
your wish with Chris this year.

498
00:25:40.413 --> 00:25:42.517
- What?
- Yeah.

499
00:25:43.724 --> 00:25:45.000
Really?

500
00:25:45.896 --> 00:25:47.344
I think he'd really like it.

501
00:25:51.931 --> 00:25:53.344
Okay.

502
00:25:59.379 --> 00:26:02.379
- Oh! Another bulls-eye, okay.
- Yes!

503
00:26:02.413 --> 00:26:03.896
You win again.

504
00:26:03.931 --> 00:26:05.689
One more round,
come on, Uncle Chace.

505
00:26:05.793 --> 00:26:07.833
I'll tell you what, why don't
you go find your mom

506
00:26:07.931 --> 00:26:10.148
and tell her I'm gonna come
visit for dinner tonight, okay?

507
00:26:10.172 --> 00:26:11.965
- Okay.
- Alright.

508
00:26:16.965 --> 00:26:19.000
- We made it!
- Yeah.

509
00:26:19.103 --> 00:26:21.758
Okay. You'll be needing these.

510
00:26:21.793 --> 00:26:23.206
What's this?

511
00:26:23.965 --> 00:26:28.275
Oh, thank you,
that's very thoughtful.

512
00:26:28.344 --> 00:26:29.931
Well, you know,

513
00:26:29.965 --> 00:26:31.424
it'd be pretty hard
to write your article

514
00:26:31.448 --> 00:26:33.103
when you can't feel
your fingers.

515
00:26:33.172 --> 00:26:36.655
- Alright.
- It's okay, loosen up.

516
00:26:36.758 --> 00:26:38.068
Let's have some fun!

517
00:26:38.620 --> 00:26:41.310
- It's not exactly my idea of...
- Yeah, alright, you're ready.

518
00:26:41.413 --> 00:26:43.551
My idea of fun, but okay.

519
00:26:48.241 --> 00:26:50.896
Okay, I'm more of
a soccer guy myself.

520
00:26:50.931 --> 00:26:52.655
Okay, okay.

521
00:26:55.379 --> 00:26:57.931
Wow! Good job!

522
00:26:57.965 --> 00:26:59.965
- Thanks.
- Okay.

523
00:27:00.068 --> 00:27:01.206
Alright.

524
00:27:01.310 --> 00:27:03.206
Warm up's over.

525
00:27:03.862 --> 00:27:05.551
Give me a snowball.

526
00:27:08.551 --> 00:27:10.724
Oh.

527
00:27:12.827 --> 00:27:14.172
Ah, okay.

528
00:27:14.896 --> 00:27:17.793
- Yes!
- Wow!

529
00:27:19.172 --> 00:27:20.655
You're making us look bad.

530
00:27:20.724 --> 00:27:22.137
Yeah, I know.

531
00:27:24.310 --> 00:27:25.862
This baby's going downtown.

532
00:27:26.344 --> 00:27:27.700
You just need to stop
trying so hard.

533
00:27:27.724 --> 00:27:30.206
You think it's so easy,
well why don't you try?

534
00:27:30.310 --> 00:27:31.827
Alright.

535
00:27:32.965 --> 00:27:34.517
- Come on!
- Nice!

536
00:27:42.137 --> 00:27:44.137
We're almost here.

537
00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:47.517
Alright, what am I looking at?

538
00:27:47.586 --> 00:27:51.068
This is my favourite Christmas
market in all of New York.

539
00:28:02.931 --> 00:28:06.068
Huh. Look.

540
00:28:06.620 --> 00:28:07.689
It's you.

541
00:28:08.103 --> 00:28:10.551
Ha.

542
00:28:16.931 --> 00:28:18.172
What?

543
00:28:19.482 --> 00:28:20.931
Oh, is that him?!
Shh!

544
00:28:21.034 --> 00:28:22.379
It's too soon to tell.

545
00:28:24.793 --> 00:28:27.586
You're right. Looks handsome.

546
00:28:27.655 --> 00:28:30.275
How can you tell? It's just
the back of his head.

547
00:28:30.379 --> 00:28:31.724
I don't know, I just...

548
00:28:32.724 --> 00:28:33.896
I'm nervous.

549
00:28:34.620 --> 00:28:35.758
Why am I nervous?

550
00:28:39.965 --> 00:28:43.448
- It's not him.
- Oh. Shucks.

551
00:28:45.068 --> 00:28:47.310
Hey, he's pretty
handsome though.

552
00:28:47.413 --> 00:28:48.562
If you don't find
the real Chace,

553
00:28:48.586 --> 00:28:49.734
you could always go
for that guy.

554
00:28:49.758 --> 00:28:51.620
What did I tell you?
I'm not giving up.

555
00:28:55.275 --> 00:28:56.793
Aw no, not again. What?

556
00:28:57.310 --> 00:28:59.620
The Christmas photographer's
here.

557
00:29:00.655 --> 00:29:02.517
It's like, the best part
of the market.

558
00:29:02.620 --> 00:29:04.172
They have backdrops and props.

559
00:29:04.275 --> 00:29:06.482
- No. No.
- Really?

560
00:29:06.551 --> 00:29:09.620
I do not photograph well.
It's a bad idea.

561
00:29:09.655 --> 00:29:11.758
Well, I find that
hard to believe.

562
00:29:13.448 --> 00:29:14.448
What?

563
00:29:15.137 --> 00:29:16.448
You know what I mean.

564
00:29:18.517 --> 00:29:20.137
- Yeah?
- Oh, whatever.

565
00:29:20.206 --> 00:29:22.689
No, no, um, elaborate please.

566
00:29:25.724 --> 00:29:28.482
- Fine, I'll go alone.
- No, far be it for me

567
00:29:28.551 --> 00:29:31.827
to deprive the world of this...
photogenic face.

568
00:29:42.620 --> 00:29:44.793
- Like a reindeer...
- Ah! My eye!

569
00:29:52.482 --> 00:29:56.172
So good, yes, yes.

570
00:29:57.103 --> 00:29:59.793
I told you.

571
00:30:15.896 --> 00:30:18.758
Okay, come on. I told you,
I'm not that photogenic.

572
00:30:19.862 --> 00:30:21.137
It's Chace.

573
00:30:21.931 --> 00:30:23.620
- What? Where?
- Here.

574
00:30:24.103 --> 00:30:25.655
He was just here.

575
00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:29.448
This kid looks
kind of familiar.

576
00:30:29.482 --> 00:30:32.413
I can't believe that
we missed him again.

577
00:30:32.931 --> 00:30:34.965
Okay. You're Chace.

578
00:30:35.482 --> 00:30:36.965
Where do you go next?

579
00:30:40.137 --> 00:30:41.379
I know just the place.

580
00:30:41.482 --> 00:30:43.079
Say, these gloves do make
a difference.

581
00:30:43.103 --> 00:30:45.448
I can almost feel
my fingers again.

582
00:30:45.482 --> 00:30:46.931
Well, you're welcome.

583
00:30:53.137 --> 00:30:54.689
Thank you!

584
00:30:56.206 --> 00:30:57.620
Hold these.

585
00:31:06.034 --> 00:31:07.862
Wow. You are very prepared.

586
00:31:07.896 --> 00:31:10.724
You're like the Boy Scouts
of Christmas.

587
00:31:10.827 --> 00:31:12.482
Thank you.

588
00:31:12.862 --> 00:31:15.379
Oh. Cheers.

coming down,

maybe we should think about...
I love this city!

610
00:32:51.448 --> 00:32:53.103
Hey, can I ask you a question?

611
00:32:53.172 --> 00:32:54.448
Mm-hmm.

612
00:32:54.517 --> 00:32:58.137
If you love this city so much,
why did you leave?

613
00:32:58.241 --> 00:33:00.482
It's a tale as old as time.

614
00:33:02.206 --> 00:33:04.482
Move for a guy.

615
00:33:04.517 --> 00:33:07.551
- That old chestnut, huh?
- Yeah.

616
00:33:08.310 --> 00:33:09.827
Then you stayed there?

617
00:33:10.517 --> 00:33:12.827
Yeah, the company
that I work for has promised me

618
00:33:12.862 --> 00:33:15.827
a position in graphic design
eventually.

619
00:33:18.931 --> 00:33:23.793
But I'm starting to think that
eventually is never gonna come.

620
00:33:26.068 --> 00:33:28.217
Well hopefully my friend Phoebe
will come through for you.

621
00:33:28.241 --> 00:33:30.655
Yeah. Hopefully.

622
00:33:36.482 --> 00:33:39.517
Okay. So, let me ask you this.

623
00:33:39.551 --> 00:33:41.689
What is about this
particular concert

624
00:33:41.793 --> 00:33:43.310
that keeps you coming back?

625
00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:46.517
Well, I think the music speaks
for itself.

626
00:33:46.586 --> 00:33:48.103
But it's also a tradition.

627
00:33:49.482 --> 00:33:51.172
- Right. Tradition.
- Mm-hmm.

628
00:33:52.034 --> 00:33:54.655
What is about traditions
that gets everyone

629
00:33:54.689 --> 00:33:56.517
so worked up over Christmas?

630
00:33:58.689 --> 00:34:00.655
Well, Christmas
is the one time of year

631
00:34:00.689 --> 00:34:02.896
that you get to be together
with everyone you love.

632
00:34:02.931 --> 00:34:06.379
And then the traditions
have this incredible power

633
00:34:06.413 --> 00:34:10.172
to transport you back to the
happiest memories with those people.

634
00:34:20.241 --> 00:34:21.689
You okay?

635
00:34:23.482 --> 00:34:25.758
- Yeah.
- Yeah? You sure?

636
00:34:25.862 --> 00:34:27.000
I'm sure.

637
00:34:27.551 --> 00:34:28.931
That's really well put.

638
00:34:30.620 --> 00:34:32.448
You mind if I put it
in the article?

639
00:34:33.275 --> 00:34:35.034
Right, the article.

640
00:34:35.689 --> 00:34:37.724
How's that going by the way?

641
00:34:37.758 --> 00:34:41.344
Well, the fact that it's going
at all is because of you.

642
00:34:42.241 --> 00:34:44.448
Explain to me again why
you're writing an article

643
00:34:44.551 --> 00:34:46.379
on a topic you clearly
have no interest in?

644
00:34:47.758 --> 00:34:50.068
Oh, if I could only
explain that myself.

645
00:34:50.137 --> 00:34:52.724
Wasn't my choice.

646
00:34:54.241 --> 00:34:55.793
Kind of a long story, but...

647
00:34:56.413 --> 00:34:58.413
let's just say I'm not
the best at sticking

648
00:34:58.482 --> 00:35:01.137
to the parameters
of the project.

649
00:35:02.275 --> 00:35:06.793
I actually used to dream
about writing a novel.

650
00:35:07.965 --> 00:35:12.344
After I graduated,
I fell into this job, and...

651
00:35:12.793 --> 00:35:14.000
it's an expensive city.

652
00:35:14.655 --> 00:35:16.448
- Yep.
- Grateful for the work.

653
00:35:16.482 --> 00:35:18.827
But now years have gone by

654
00:35:18.862 --> 00:35:21.448
and I feel like I've lost touch
with why I started

655
00:35:21.517 --> 00:35:22.793
in the first place.

656
00:35:24.482 --> 00:35:26.137
Then write your novel.

657
00:35:26.724 --> 00:35:29.448
What's stopping you?
It's not that easy.

658
00:35:29.482 --> 00:35:32.241
You gotta have a publisher,
an editor, and...

659
00:35:34.517 --> 00:35:35.931
And what?

660
00:35:38.551 --> 00:35:40.827
Well, I guess if
I'm being honest, um...

661
00:35:42.379 --> 00:35:43.793
Maybe I've lost
a little confidence.

662
00:35:45.172 --> 00:35:48.551
I've been writing fluff
for so long that I don't know

663
00:35:48.655 --> 00:35:50.827
if I still have what it takes.

664
00:35:50.862 --> 00:35:52.517
Well, you won't know
unless you try.

665
00:35:52.620 --> 00:35:55.448
And there's no better time
to take a leap of faith

666
00:35:55.517 --> 00:35:56.655
than Christmas.

667
00:35:57.137 --> 00:35:58.931
While I appreciate
your unrelenting faith

668
00:35:58.965 --> 00:36:01.206
in the Christmas...
No, hear me out.

669
00:36:01.241 --> 00:36:03.413
Every year my sister and I make
a Christmas wish,

670
00:36:03.517 --> 00:36:04.896
and they always come true.

671
00:36:05.620 --> 00:36:07.689
And what did you wish
for last year?

672
00:36:07.724 --> 00:36:10.551
Well, if you must know,
both Amy and I wished

673
00:36:10.620 --> 00:36:12.172
to meet the man of our dreams.

674
00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:17.517
What?
I'm sorry, I don't mean

675
00:36:17.551 --> 00:36:19.034
to laugh, I, uh...

676
00:36:19.068 --> 00:36:20.896
You can think whatever
you want to think,

677
00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:22.517
but every year,
our wish comes true

678
00:36:22.551 --> 00:36:23.896
and this year is no exception.

679
00:36:23.965 --> 00:36:27.034
And maybe if you opened
yourself up to a little bit

680
00:36:27.103 --> 00:36:30.551
of Christmas magic,
it would work for you too.

681
00:36:30.620 --> 00:36:32.517
Maybe we'll agree to disagree.

682
00:36:32.551 --> 00:36:34.000
Maybe we will.

683
00:36:38.551 --> 00:36:39.862
See you tomorrow?

684
00:36:41.206 --> 00:36:42.206
You bet.

685
00:36:42.689 --> 00:36:44.689
- See ya.
- See ya.

686
00:37:07.724 --> 00:37:09.241
Good morning.

687
00:37:10.413 --> 00:37:12.103
Oh. Darling,

688
00:37:12.137 --> 00:37:14.275
I can't wait for you to
see the dresses

689
00:37:14.310 --> 00:37:15.931
I had them pull for you.

690
00:37:15.965 --> 00:37:17.827
You are gonna be a show stopper.

691
00:37:17.931 --> 00:37:20.068
That Chace fellow won't know
what hit him.

692
00:37:25.137 --> 00:37:28.517
Yeah, okay, so really quick,
I kind of agreed to let Mom

693
00:37:28.620 --> 00:37:30.758
pick out some dresses for you.
So...

694
00:37:30.793 --> 00:37:32.965
You're a stylist,
how could you do this to me?

695
00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:34.941
I know that, but she is
our mother and she insisted

696
00:37:34.965 --> 00:37:37.044
and then she got so excited
and then, you know, so...

697
00:37:37.068 --> 00:37:38.862
we just need to humour her,
okay?

698
00:37:38.965 --> 00:37:40.758
But don't worry,
I had them set aside a dress

699
00:37:40.793 --> 00:37:42.275
I know you're gonna love.

700
00:37:42.344 --> 00:37:44.965
Hey!
Tada!

701
00:37:45.068 --> 00:37:46.241
Ooh!

702
00:37:54.793 --> 00:37:56.551
I can tell.

703
00:37:56.586 --> 00:37:58.655
Yeah, she knows.

704
00:37:59.586 --> 00:38:01.103
Let's try this.

705
00:38:03.206 --> 00:38:05.310
It's very... blue.

706
00:38:05.344 --> 00:38:06.724
Oh, it's just awful.

707
00:38:06.827 --> 00:38:07.827
Okay, good.

708
00:38:07.896 --> 00:38:09.286
Do we all agree this is
not the one?

709
00:38:09.310 --> 00:38:11.206
No. No, it's not gonna work,
hold on...

710
00:38:13.344 --> 00:38:14.862
What about...

711
00:38:14.896 --> 00:38:17.724
Oh my gosh, hey.
You forgot about this one.

712
00:38:17.827 --> 00:38:19.206
Maybe this one?

713
00:38:19.310 --> 00:38:20.896
She should just try it
and then see.

714
00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:23.172
- Mom, great taste.
- I know, right?

715
00:38:23.241 --> 00:38:25.034
Thanks. Yeah.

716
00:38:26.034 --> 00:38:27.310
Yeah.

717
00:38:34.413 --> 00:38:37.689
Thought I'd bring you a little
Christmas inspiration.

718
00:38:37.724 --> 00:38:39.896
But from the looks of it,
you don't need any.

719
00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:42.000
I don't know.

720
00:38:42.034 --> 00:38:45.551
Something Cara said yesterday,
it sparked something.

721
00:38:45.655 --> 00:38:47.000
It's just been
flowing out of me.

722
00:38:47.034 --> 00:38:50.068
I gotta say, when I suggested
this little arrangement,

723
00:38:50.172 --> 00:38:52.793
I never imagined it
to be such a success.

724
00:38:52.827 --> 00:38:54.482
What do you mean?

725
00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:57.310
Look at you.
You're enthusiastically writing

726
00:38:57.344 --> 00:38:58.827
an article about Christmas.

727
00:38:58.862 --> 00:39:01.068
She's clearly had quite
the effect on you.

728
00:39:01.137 --> 00:39:02.862
Okay, I wouldn't go that far.

729
00:39:02.896 --> 00:39:04.931
Alright, I'm working on
a deadline here.

730
00:39:04.965 --> 00:39:09.517
Okay, whatever you say.
So, what's on the agenda today?

731
00:39:10.413 --> 00:39:11.931
I don't know, actually.

732
00:39:11.965 --> 00:39:13.965
She likes everything
to be a surprise, so...

733
00:39:14.068 --> 00:39:16.896
Yeah, I'm supposed to meet her
at... Right now.

734
00:39:16.965 --> 00:39:19.793
Shoot, I gotta go. I'm late.

735
00:39:20.965 --> 00:39:24.137
Alright, but first you have
to try my drink.

736
00:39:24.241 --> 00:39:25.551
Okay.

737
00:39:28.413 --> 00:39:30.758
Oh! Um... Like candy cane?

738
00:39:30.862 --> 00:39:33.379
- Yeah.
- Yeah, it's, uh...

739
00:39:33.965 --> 00:39:36.172
Not my thing. Good try though.

740
00:39:37.586 --> 00:39:39.000
Don't listen to him!

741
00:39:58.068 --> 00:40:00.206
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

742
00:40:00.241 --> 00:40:01.241
Wow.

743
00:40:05.310 --> 00:40:06.551
Oh, wow.

744
00:40:08.551 --> 00:40:10.793
I... I'm speechless.

745
00:40:12.758 --> 00:40:14.103
It's beautiful.

746
00:40:14.862 --> 00:40:17.551
Well hello. Who's this?

747
00:40:18.586 --> 00:40:20.551
Michael. Hi.

748
00:40:25.586 --> 00:40:26.793
Hi.

749
00:40:30.482 --> 00:40:32.103
Um, Michael, who's...

750
00:40:32.206 --> 00:40:35.172
Oh, Michael.
So nice to meet you.

751
00:40:36.413 --> 00:40:40.862
Oh my gosh, I am so sorry,
I completely lost track of time.

752
00:40:40.896 --> 00:40:42.586
I'm gonna go change.

753
00:40:42.689 --> 00:40:44.034
That's all good.

754
00:40:44.758 --> 00:40:47.379
Uh, so...
you're the writer?

755
00:40:47.758 --> 00:40:49.586
That would be me.

756
00:40:49.620 --> 00:40:52.068
And you must be the sister.
Yes.

757
00:40:52.103 --> 00:40:53.965
Well, congrats on
the upcoming nuptials.

758
00:40:54.068 --> 00:40:56.655
- Oh, thank you.
- I'm the mother.

759
00:40:56.758 --> 00:40:59.965
Ah. Yes. I was putting
that together, yeah.

760
00:41:00.758 --> 00:41:03.137
Uh, so what are
you two up to today?

761
00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:07.000
Ah, I couldn't say.
Apparently it's a surprise.

762
00:41:07.068 --> 00:41:12.034
Wow. Well, my sister is just
full of surprises isn't she?

763
00:41:12.137 --> 00:41:13.655
She certainly is.

764
00:41:13.724 --> 00:41:15.206
Okay, I'm ready.
Okay, I'm ready.

765
00:41:15.310 --> 00:41:17.793
Mom, thank you. Amy, I love you.

766
00:41:17.827 --> 00:41:19.448
Michael, let's go.
Okay.

767
00:41:19.482 --> 00:41:20.965
Uh, nice to meet you ladies.

768
00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:23.310
Okay.

769
00:41:23.413 --> 00:41:25.137
Okay. Who is...

770
00:41:25.172 --> 00:41:27.103
Michael.
Wow.

771
00:41:28.137 --> 00:41:30.206
Okay, are you gonna tell me
where we're going

772
00:41:30.310 --> 00:41:32.137
because I'm starting
to fear for my life.

773
00:41:32.206 --> 00:41:34.758
What is this?

774
00:41:35.137 --> 00:41:38.310
Oh, it's only the most
exclusive Christmas tree lot

775
00:41:38.344 --> 00:41:40.827
in all of Manhattan.
Only the best trees

776
00:41:40.931 --> 00:41:42.827
from the best nurseries
are sold here.

777
00:41:42.896 --> 00:41:45.310
And I figured,
since you don't have one...

778
00:41:45.965 --> 00:41:47.803
Okay, I'm picking up what
you're putting down.

779
00:41:47.827 --> 00:41:49.827
Let me introduce you to Giles.

780
00:41:49.931 --> 00:41:51.000
Who's Giles?

781
00:41:51.103 --> 00:41:52.931
He's just
my Christmas tree guy.

782
00:41:53.344 --> 00:41:54.448
Come on.

783
00:41:54.517 --> 00:41:56.965
Cara! Hey!

784
00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:58.827
- Good to see you!
- Hi.

785
00:41:58.862 --> 00:42:00.493
Michael here is
in the market for a tree.

786
00:42:00.517 --> 00:42:03.103
Oh, well what kind of tree
are we looking for?

787
00:42:03.206 --> 00:42:06.586
Little balsam? Douglas?

788
00:42:06.689 --> 00:42:09.275
Maybe an East Himalayan?
West Himalayan? Korean?

789
00:42:09.379 --> 00:42:12.689
Red, silver?
Uh, I don't really know-

790
00:42:12.724 --> 00:42:14.103
- He hasn't had a tree
for years,

791
00:42:14.206 --> 00:42:15.689
I think he might need
a crash course.

792
00:42:15.724 --> 00:42:18.931
Well now, let's start with
our basic Fraser Fir,

793
00:42:19.034 --> 00:42:20.724
one of our most fragrant,
I might add.

794
00:42:20.827 --> 00:42:22.034
Isn't that right, Cara?

795
00:42:23.344 --> 00:42:26.206
Cara?
Oh, yes, absolutely.

796
00:42:26.275 --> 00:42:27.976
Would you two excuse me for
just one second?

797
00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:29.068
Sure.

798
00:42:39.551 --> 00:42:40.655
Ah!

799
00:42:40.689 --> 00:42:42.724
You scared me.

800
00:42:42.827 --> 00:42:44.551
- You abandoned me!
- I did not!

801
00:42:44.620 --> 00:42:47.965
Giles is the best in the biz,
you should be so lucky.

802
00:42:48.068 --> 00:42:50.103
Yeah, he's trying to sell me
a 300-dollar tree.

803
00:42:50.206 --> 00:42:51.931
Yes, they can be
a little expensive,

804
00:42:52.034 --> 00:42:53.344
but they're worth it.

805
00:42:53.379 --> 00:42:55.896
And who said you need to get one
that's ten feet tall?

806
00:42:58.068 --> 00:43:01.034
This one is perfect for you.

807
00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:04.620
It's kind of cute I guess.

808
00:43:05.413 --> 00:43:06.448
Kind of cute?

809
00:43:07.241 --> 00:43:08.965
Okay.

810
00:43:09.965 --> 00:43:12.000
This is the tabletop
Norwegian Spruce.

811
00:43:12.103 --> 00:43:14.068
It's a great starter tree.

812
00:43:15.586 --> 00:43:17.448
Alright.

813
00:43:17.551 --> 00:43:18.931
Alright.

814
00:43:19.413 --> 00:43:22.103
How much is this... Actually,
nevermind. Don't tell me.

815
00:43:25.724 --> 00:43:27.068
It does smell pretty good.

816
00:43:27.103 --> 00:43:29.724
Oh, ain't that beautiful?
There you go.

817
00:43:29.758 --> 00:43:31.103
It's the winner, right there.

818
00:43:31.172 --> 00:43:32.896
Let me wrap this up
for you, hang on.

819
00:43:32.931 --> 00:43:35.482
So, uh, where'd
you run off to anyway?

820
00:43:35.586 --> 00:43:39.310
Oh, I thought I saw Chace,
but he disappeared.

821
00:43:39.413 --> 00:43:41.379
- Really?
- I couldn't catch up to him.

822
00:43:41.413 --> 00:43:43.551
Oh. Sorry.

823
00:43:44.241 --> 00:43:46.448
You know what?
I think I'm gonna leave him

824
00:43:46.482 --> 00:43:48.586
a little bread crumb.
A what?

825
00:43:59.793 --> 00:44:01.724
There. Now, he'll have
my number.

826
00:44:01.827 --> 00:44:04.517
And you're sure he's gonna
pick this exact tree?

827
00:44:04.586 --> 00:44:07.655
No, but if it's meant to be,
he'll find it.

828
00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:11.172
- Oh.
- Here you go.

829
00:44:11.241 --> 00:44:13.034
Thank you.
What do I owe you?

830
00:44:13.137 --> 00:44:15.482
You know what?
Merry Christmas.

831
00:44:15.517 --> 00:44:16.517
- Really?
- Yeah.

832
00:44:16.620 --> 00:44:18.000
Giles!

833
00:44:18.068 --> 00:44:20.448
Anytime, anytime.
I'll see you soon?

834
00:44:20.482 --> 00:44:21.827
- Yes.
- Okay.

835
00:44:21.862 --> 00:44:23.034
- Thank you.
- Take care.

836
00:44:23.137 --> 00:44:25.655
Yeah. Merry Christmas.
Hey, um...

837
00:44:26.344 --> 00:44:29.310
I don't know about you but
I'm feeling kind of cold.

838
00:44:29.344 --> 00:44:32.655
And I did see
some cozy-looking firepits

839
00:44:32.689 --> 00:44:34.482
and some eggnog we could sip on.

840
00:44:35.172 --> 00:44:37.482
You wanna hang out here,
see if he comes back again?

841
00:44:38.241 --> 00:44:39.482
Really? You don't mind?

842
00:44:39.517 --> 00:44:41.217
Well, you did help me pick out
the perfect...

843
00:44:41.241 --> 00:44:43.172
Okay, yeah, yeah,
sounds great!

844
00:44:43.206 --> 00:44:44.517
Oh, you came back?

845
00:44:54.241 --> 00:44:56.482
So?
It's good.

846
00:44:58.068 --> 00:45:00.275
- And you like eggnog.
- Mm-hmm.

847
00:45:01.137 --> 00:45:04.103
Gotta say, you are one
confusing man, Michael.

848
00:45:04.137 --> 00:45:06.862
Hey, never said I didn't like
anything to do with Christmas.

849
00:45:09.482 --> 00:45:10.931
I actually used to love it.

850
00:45:11.931 --> 00:45:14.413
It was my dad's favourite
holiday, we'd go all out.

851
00:45:15.517 --> 00:45:16.758
In fact, uh...

852
00:45:18.586 --> 00:45:19.586
What?

853
00:45:23.931 --> 00:45:25.310
I... nevermind.

854
00:45:25.413 --> 00:45:27.068
No, I wanna hear it.

855
00:45:33.620 --> 00:45:36.862
Hey, it's Phoebe
from Evergreen.

856
00:45:41.793 --> 00:45:43.275
What did she say?

857
00:45:45.793 --> 00:45:47.275
Sorry. Um...

858
00:45:48.275 --> 00:45:49.700
Said that your stuff
looks promising,

859
00:45:49.724 --> 00:45:52.206
but there's not enough in
the portfolio to move forward.

860
00:45:55.034 --> 00:45:56.586
Yeah, can't blame her.

861
00:45:57.068 --> 00:45:58.551
They need someone
with experience.

862
00:45:59.896 --> 00:46:01.931
Don't give up, okay?
I've seen your stuff.

863
00:46:02.793 --> 00:46:03.793
You're really good.

864
00:46:04.586 --> 00:46:05.586
Thanks.

865
00:46:06.448 --> 00:46:07.655
And thanks for trying.

866
00:46:09.275 --> 00:46:10.448
I really appreciate it.

867
00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:14.000
Look...

868
00:46:14.620 --> 00:46:16.780
I'm sorry my end of the bargain
didn't exactly hold up.

869
00:46:17.827 --> 00:46:19.620
If you want to call it,
I'd understand.

870
00:46:20.344 --> 00:46:22.493
You've already given me a really
good start to the article, so...

871
00:46:22.517 --> 00:46:23.757
No, don't be silly, I told you

872
00:46:23.827 --> 00:46:25.793
that I would help
and I'm gonna see it through.

873
00:46:27.655 --> 00:46:29.413
Turns out your company
is not so bad either.

874
00:46:32.758 --> 00:46:33.827
I don't know about you,

875
00:46:33.862 --> 00:46:35.448
but I'm getting
a little peckish. Um...

876
00:46:35.862 --> 00:46:37.655
Grab us a few of those
gingerbread cookies.

877
00:46:37.758 --> 00:46:38.931
That would... Wait.

878
00:46:38.965 --> 00:46:40.379
Gingerbread!

879
00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:43.793
Uh, I think they have
shortbread too, if you're...

880
00:46:43.827 --> 00:46:44.965
What time is it?

881
00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:46.517
Uh, quarter to five.

882
00:46:46.620 --> 00:46:48.310
Okay, we need to go.
Grab the tree.

883
00:46:55.310 --> 00:46:57.137
I have to go.
Oh, here. Bye.

884
00:46:57.379 --> 00:46:58.655
- Thanks!
- Nice to meet you.

885
00:46:58.724 --> 00:47:01.068
Uncle Chace, Uncle Chace,
can you grab this one?

886
00:47:02.344 --> 00:47:04.034
I don't know, buddy,
it's pretty big.

887
00:47:04.068 --> 00:47:05.379
Do you think it'll fit?

888
00:47:05.413 --> 00:47:06.862
Yes, it will fit!

889
00:47:07.620 --> 00:47:09.862
Please, please!
Alright.

890
00:47:14.241 --> 00:47:15.172
Uh, yeah.

891
00:47:15.206 --> 00:47:16.034
Yes!

892
00:47:16.103 --> 00:47:17.103
Yeah! Okay.

893
00:47:29.206 --> 00:47:30.344
We're too late.

894
00:47:31.379 --> 00:47:33.413
I was supposed to pick up
my sister's wedding cake.

895
00:47:34.206 --> 00:47:38.206
I can't believe I completely lost track
of time and she trusted me with this

896
00:47:38.241 --> 00:47:39.862
and I just don't know
what I'm gonna do.

897
00:47:41.241 --> 00:47:42.413
I'm sure she'll understand.

898
00:47:43.517 --> 00:47:45.206
It's the wedding cake.

899
00:47:45.241 --> 00:47:47.379
The entire wedding revolves
around the cake.

900
00:47:47.413 --> 00:47:49.034
Some people only show up
for the cake!

901
00:47:49.689 --> 00:47:51.482
Oh God, I don't know
what I'm gonna do.

902
00:47:58.034 --> 00:47:59.413
I think I might have an idea.

903
00:48:11.172 --> 00:48:15.172
So, what? Pete's suddenly getting
into the cake-making business?

904
00:48:15.275 --> 00:48:17.448
No. But we are.

905
00:48:17.482 --> 00:48:20.586
One peppermint hot cocoa,
one black coffee.

906
00:48:21.241 --> 00:48:22.761
Actually, we have
to use the kitchen.

907
00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:24.000
It's an emergency.

908
00:48:24.034 --> 00:48:26.068
Oh, you know where it is.
Go for it.

909
00:48:32.482 --> 00:48:34.458
Okay, I appreciate
what you're trying to do here,

910
00:48:34.482 --> 00:48:36.413
but I don't see how we can pull
this off.

911
00:48:36.896 --> 00:48:37.965
I'm a terrible baker.

912
00:48:38.034 --> 00:48:39.769
Well, lucky for you,
you're in the presence

913
00:48:39.793 --> 00:48:41.413
of a master baker.

914
00:48:45.586 --> 00:48:47.241
Uh...

915
00:48:47.310 --> 00:48:48.482
Ooh.

916
00:48:51.655 --> 00:48:54.482
I have said it once
and I will say it again:

917
00:48:54.586 --> 00:48:56.448
you are a confusing man.

918
00:48:58.931 --> 00:48:59.931
For you.

919
00:49:02.344 --> 00:49:03.448
Mixing bowls.

920
00:49:04.724 --> 00:49:06.793
Alright.

921
00:49:07.655 --> 00:49:09.620
Let me show you how it's done.

922
00:49:16.344 --> 00:49:17.724
What are you doing there?

923
00:49:17.827 --> 00:49:18.620
Mixing.

924
00:49:18.689 --> 00:49:21.896
Yes, something, but if it's...

925
00:49:23.344 --> 00:49:25.172
You have to really
smooth it out,

926
00:49:25.206 --> 00:49:26.482
so it doesn't get too lumpy.

927
00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:28.000
Kinda...

928
00:49:28.655 --> 00:49:29.551
It's good, though.
I'm liking this.

929
00:49:29.655 --> 00:49:30.689
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

930
00:49:30.758 --> 00:49:31.907
It's looking good, but that...

931
00:49:31.931 --> 00:49:33.320
That needs a little bit...
Yeah, sift it.

932
00:49:33.344 --> 00:49:34.344
And you just kinda...

933
00:49:34.413 --> 00:49:36.310
Hit it on the side
a little bit.

934
00:49:36.344 --> 00:49:39.310
Ooh. Okay. Just like that?

935
00:49:39.344 --> 00:49:40.517
Perfect.

936
00:49:42.896 --> 00:49:43.896
Just a little more.

937
00:49:44.206 --> 00:49:46.000
How'd you get so good at this?

938
00:49:46.965 --> 00:49:48.827
My family owned
a bakery in Queens.

939
00:49:50.034 --> 00:49:52.517
Christmas time was always
the busy time, so...

940
00:49:53.517 --> 00:49:55.137
I'd go into the kitchen,
help out my dad.

941
00:49:56.689 --> 00:49:58.206
So, it runs in
the family then.

942
00:49:58.310 --> 00:49:59.551
You could say that.

943
00:50:00.034 --> 00:50:04.000
I liked it, but it was really just
an excuse to hang out with my dad.

944
00:50:05.482 --> 00:50:07.482
See, this is what
I'm talking about.

945
00:50:08.724 --> 00:50:11.172
These traditions let you relive
your fondest memories.

946
00:50:18.689 --> 00:50:19.689
Yeah.

947
00:50:20.344 --> 00:50:21.689
I guess, yeah.

948
00:50:23.517 --> 00:50:25.482
Sorry, did I... say something?

949
00:50:26.551 --> 00:50:28.655
No, no, no. Um...

950
00:50:31.689 --> 00:50:35.206
Just sometimes, these memories
can be hard to relive.

951
00:50:35.310 --> 00:50:38.517
Just... why I tend
to avoid 'em.

952
00:50:39.344 --> 00:50:40.655
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to...

953
00:50:40.689 --> 00:50:43.517
Oh, no, don't apologize.
It's...

954
00:50:45.793 --> 00:50:46.862
It's just...

955
00:50:49.827 --> 00:50:51.103
My dad and I...

956
00:50:54.620 --> 00:50:56.034
We were really close.

957
00:50:58.655 --> 00:51:01.310
He died when I was a teenager

958
00:51:01.413 --> 00:51:02.862
around Christmas time,
so it's...

959
00:51:05.275 --> 00:51:08.103
a little hard to be around
the city this time of the year.

960
00:51:12.551 --> 00:51:15.517
It's just a lot of memories.
You know?

961
00:51:17.206 --> 00:51:18.206
Yeah.

962
00:51:20.068 --> 00:51:22.103
I'm so sorry, I didn't even
consider...

963
00:51:22.586 --> 00:51:23.931
Don't... don't apologize.

964
00:51:25.724 --> 00:51:29.965
I have spent years
trying to avoid reliving this,

965
00:51:30.068 --> 00:51:31.724
thinking that it was
going to be hard.

966
00:51:33.413 --> 00:51:35.275
But I don't know,
just since I'm...

967
00:51:35.896 --> 00:51:37.413
running around
the city with you,

968
00:51:37.448 --> 00:51:38.931
reliving all this stuff, it...

969
00:51:41.758 --> 00:51:44.206
I feel like I'm reliving
more good memories than bad.

970
00:51:46.068 --> 00:51:47.448
So...

971
00:51:51.137 --> 00:51:54.034
I'm so glad you're getting more than
just an article out of all of this.

972
00:51:56.344 --> 00:51:57.551
Me too.

973
00:52:00.793 --> 00:52:01.965
Me too.

974
00:52:05.965 --> 00:52:08.931
I gotta say, this really
is some of my best work.

975
00:52:09.482 --> 00:52:12.620
It's a shame I'm not gonna be
able to sample my masterpiece.

976
00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:17.655
Well you should
come with me then.

977
00:52:19.448 --> 00:52:20.620
- Where?
- The wedding.

978
00:52:24.620 --> 00:52:25.793
How about Chace?

979
00:52:26.482 --> 00:52:27.931
The wedding's in three days.

980
00:52:29.034 --> 00:52:31.482
And you know,
I'm starting to think

981
00:52:31.517 --> 00:52:33.275
that maybe it wasn't
meant to be.

982
00:52:36.344 --> 00:52:37.344
I'd love to.

983
00:52:39.965 --> 00:52:41.034
Are you sure?

984
00:52:41.103 --> 00:52:44.241
Yeah, you know. I'm gonna go
with someone.

985
00:52:45.655 --> 00:52:47.482
I'm sure I could do
a lot worse than you.

986
00:52:53.793 --> 00:52:56.310
Thought you too could use
a little pick-me-up.

987
00:52:56.344 --> 00:52:57.275
- Ooh!
- Hey.

988
00:52:57.310 --> 00:52:59.000
Am I interrupting something?

989
00:52:59.103 --> 00:53:00.137
No.

990
00:53:01.896 --> 00:53:07.655
Okay. I'll just put
these here and... leave.

991
00:53:08.655 --> 00:53:09.862
Thanks, Pete.

992
00:53:12.034 --> 00:53:13.034
See you, buddy.

993
00:53:17.586 --> 00:53:18.689
Thanks, Pete.

994
00:53:37.689 --> 00:53:39.344
- Hey.
- Hi.

995
00:53:39.379 --> 00:53:40.379
How's it going?

996
00:53:41.034 --> 00:53:42.862
Um, could I get...

997
00:53:43.551 --> 00:53:46.758
one peppermint hot cocoa to go?

998
00:53:47.241 --> 00:53:51.379
One PHC, coming right up.
That'll be 3.50, please.

999
00:53:51.482 --> 00:53:52.517
Right, thanks.

1000
00:54:00.275 --> 00:54:01.344
Looking for someone?

1001
00:54:01.448 --> 00:54:04.379
Uh, no. I mean...

1002
00:54:05.758 --> 00:54:09.413
No, uh. Gotta go.
Merry Christmas!

1003
00:54:09.448 --> 00:54:11.241
Merry Christmas!

1004
00:54:12.896 --> 00:54:14.793
Actually, yes, yes, I am...

1005
00:54:14.896 --> 00:54:16.275
I am looking for someone.

1006
00:54:16.793 --> 00:54:18.433
Now, I know this is
gonna sound kind of...

1007
00:54:18.862 --> 00:54:21.448
kooky, but I'm looking
for this woman,

1008
00:54:21.551 --> 00:54:22.448
her name is Cara.

1009
00:54:22.517 --> 00:54:24.206
We met a few days ago and we...

1010
00:54:24.655 --> 00:54:26.137
Uh, we really hit it off

1011
00:54:26.172 --> 00:54:29.000
and I gave her my number,
so when I didn't hear from her,

1012
00:54:29.103 --> 00:54:30.793
I kind of lost all hope,
but then...

1013
00:54:31.620 --> 00:54:32.620
Then...

1014
00:54:32.655 --> 00:54:35.586
I found this, that's her.

1015
00:54:35.620 --> 00:54:37.310
Uh, the number got smudged

1016
00:54:37.344 --> 00:54:41.068
but she says she comes here every
year for the peppermint hot cocoa.

1017
00:54:41.103 --> 00:54:44.931
So, I was hoping that
you might have seen her.

1018
00:54:46.551 --> 00:54:48.413
I really don't know.

1019
00:54:50.275 --> 00:54:51.965
Okay. That's okay.

1020
00:54:52.068 --> 00:54:55.586
I knew it was a long shot,
but hey, you never know.

1021
00:54:55.620 --> 00:54:57.137
It is Christmas after all,
right?

1022
00:54:57.965 --> 00:55:00.482
I'll... Can I borrow your pen?

1023
00:55:00.551 --> 00:55:02.241
Uh, yeah.

1024
00:55:02.344 --> 00:55:04.344
Thanks. Uh...

1025
00:55:04.379 --> 00:55:06.206
If you do happen to see her,
would you mind

1026
00:55:06.310 --> 00:55:09.827
giving her my number?

1027
00:55:11.241 --> 00:55:11.896
You got it.

1028
00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:14.448
Okay! Thank you. Thanks.

1029
00:55:14.482 --> 00:55:15.655
Merry Christmas.

1030
00:55:15.724 --> 00:55:17.034
Merry Christmas.

1031
00:55:30.344 --> 00:55:31.517
Let me see it.

1032
00:55:32.551 --> 00:55:33.413
Sorry!

1033
00:55:33.517 --> 00:55:34.758
Let me see my wedding cake!

1034
00:55:34.862 --> 00:55:36.320
What are you doing,
skulking around, you creep?

1035
00:55:36.344 --> 00:55:37.206
Let me see it.

1036
00:55:37.310 --> 00:55:38.310
No means no.

1037
00:55:38.482 --> 00:55:39.482
But...

1038
00:55:41.551 --> 00:55:42.734
I can show you something else.

1039
00:55:42.758 --> 00:55:43.827
Did you finish them?

1040
00:55:43.896 --> 00:55:45.379
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh, oh!

1041
00:55:47.482 --> 00:55:49.206
Wow, Cara!

1042
00:55:50.172 --> 00:55:51.689
You've really outdone yourself.

1043
00:55:53.310 --> 00:55:54.724
Hey, I...

1044
00:55:55.965 --> 00:55:57.965
I really can't thank you enough.

1045
00:55:58.758 --> 00:56:00.678
For everything that you've done
for this wedding.

1046
00:56:01.758 --> 00:56:03.275
You're the best sister
in the world.

1047
00:56:05.241 --> 00:56:06.241
And I love you.

1048
00:56:06.896 --> 00:56:08.413
I love you too. Stop.

1049
00:56:09.862 --> 00:56:11.413
Wow, so pretty!

1050
00:56:12.620 --> 00:56:14.379
I should put this
in the fridge.

1051
00:56:22.310 --> 00:56:24.172
Hey, Amy?
Yeah?

1052
00:56:25.068 --> 00:56:26.068
Um...

1053
00:56:28.103 --> 00:56:30.275
You know the other day,
that thing you said about how

1054
00:56:30.344 --> 00:56:34.206
when you made your wish, you weren't
imagining someone like Chris?

1055
00:56:35.413 --> 00:56:36.551
Yeah.

1056
00:56:36.586 --> 00:56:38.206
Well, when you did meet,

1057
00:56:38.620 --> 00:56:40.620
how did you know
he was your soulmate?

1058
00:56:40.724 --> 00:56:42.896
I think it was when I realized

1059
00:56:42.931 --> 00:56:46.000
that he was different
than I knew.

1060
00:56:46.793 --> 00:56:47.907
I mean, it wasn't immediate.

1061
00:56:47.931 --> 00:56:49.241
Not like how it is
in the movies,

1062
00:56:49.310 --> 00:56:51.793
no love at first sight
or any of that.

1063
00:56:52.413 --> 00:56:55.689
Um... And he's my polar opposite
in so many ways.

1064
00:56:56.413 --> 00:57:00.827
But... I think our differences
are what make us so compatible.

1065
00:57:01.413 --> 00:57:02.482
I mean...

1066
00:57:03.206 --> 00:57:06.620
He's my best friend and I feel
so comfortable around him and...

1067
00:57:07.172 --> 00:57:10.137
He also challenges me to grow.
You know?

1068
00:57:10.793 --> 00:57:11.965
Yeah.

1069
00:57:13.689 --> 00:57:15.275
Why do you ask?

1070
00:57:15.965 --> 00:57:19.344
I'm just...
getting ideas for my speech.

1071
00:57:19.448 --> 00:57:20.965
Oh, okay.

1072
00:57:22.862 --> 00:57:24.137
- Good night.
- Good night!

1073
00:57:36.344 --> 00:57:39.275
Still in the throes
of inspiration, I see.

1074
00:57:40.103 --> 00:57:41.517
It's really coming together.

1075
00:57:42.379 --> 00:57:43.413
Cara's been amazing.

1076
00:57:44.172 --> 00:57:45.965
You have feelings
for her, yes?

1077
00:57:49.344 --> 00:57:50.413
What?

1078
00:57:51.482 --> 00:57:52.482
No.

1079
00:57:53.482 --> 00:57:54.827
Really?

1080
00:57:56.310 --> 00:57:57.344
I don't.

1081
00:57:58.482 --> 00:58:03.517
Okay, well you won't mind
if I give her this, then?

1082
00:58:14.103 --> 00:58:15.241
Where did you get this?

1083
00:58:15.344 --> 00:58:17.034
He came in yesterday
after you left.

1084
00:58:17.689 --> 00:58:19.206
He said he found a photo strip.

1085
00:58:20.931 --> 00:58:22.379
He actually found that...

1086
00:58:23.931 --> 00:58:24.931
Apparently.

1087
00:58:25.551 --> 00:58:29.000
So, you won't mind if I give
that to her?

1088
00:58:30.724 --> 00:58:32.172
Let me give it to her.

1089
00:58:33.172 --> 00:58:34.612
I'm gonna be seeing
her later anyway.

1090
00:58:44.344 --> 00:58:45.379
Okay.

1091
00:58:48.931 --> 00:58:50.034
Cara...

1092
00:58:51.586 --> 00:58:54.241
Your wish is about to come true.

1093
00:59:01.068 --> 00:59:03.044
Don't tell me you've never
been ice-skating before.

1094
00:59:03.068 --> 00:59:05.793
No, I've... I've ice-skated.

1095
00:59:05.862 --> 00:59:08.458
You don't have to be embarrassed
if your skating's not up to snuff.

1096
00:59:08.482 --> 00:59:10.241
I can get you one of those
little cones.

1097
00:59:17.655 --> 00:59:21.379
Hey, I'm just kidding.
I am no Michelle Kwan myself.

1098
00:59:21.758 --> 00:59:23.482
No, it's just...

1099
00:59:26.241 --> 00:59:28.379
I actually used to come here
all the time with my dad.

1100
00:59:30.241 --> 00:59:32.034
So, it's one of those
memories, then.

1101
00:59:33.448 --> 00:59:34.758
Well, we can go
if you want to...

1102
00:59:34.827 --> 00:59:36.068
No.

1103
00:59:36.724 --> 00:59:37.724
No, I...

1104
00:59:38.275 --> 00:59:39.551
I think it'd actually be fun.

1105
00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:44.758
Alright, Michelle Kwan.
Let's see what you got.

1106
00:59:46.310 --> 00:59:47.586
It's like riding a bike, right?

1107
00:59:47.655 --> 00:59:48.655
Yeah!

1108
00:59:50.931 --> 00:59:53.413
Ooh! Oh.

1109
00:59:54.620 --> 00:59:58.931
Do me a favour and don't try
riding a bike anytime soon.

1110
00:59:59.000 --> 00:59:59.793
Ha-ha.

1111
00:59:59.896 --> 01:00:00.931
Okay
You ready?

1112
01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:02.517
Yeah, let's just go forward,
yeah.

1113
01:00:02.620 --> 01:00:03.655
- Okay.
- There we go.

1114
01:00:03.758 --> 01:00:05.137
This isn't embarrassing at all.

1115
01:00:06.517 --> 01:00:09.448
Well, luckily for you, there
aren't very many witnesses.

1116
01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:11.620
Which is why I like coming here
so much!

1117
01:00:11.655 --> 01:00:12.700
You actually have room to skate!

1118
01:00:12.724 --> 01:00:13.758
Ah, okay!

1119
01:00:14.413 --> 01:00:16.448
Okay, you're turning a lot!
How do you feel?

1120
01:00:16.517 --> 01:00:17.586
Yeah, I think... Okay.

1121
01:00:19.896 --> 01:00:21.482
Oh, oh! Okay.

1122
01:00:21.586 --> 01:00:23.000
Okay, now we're dancing?

1123
01:00:23.103 --> 01:00:25.793
I'm not prepared
for both of these things.

1124
01:00:25.827 --> 01:00:28.551
You know, good, yeah.
Yeah, yeah.

1125
01:00:30.448 --> 01:00:31.448
Look out!

1126
01:00:38.103 --> 01:00:38.931
I survived.

1127
01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:40.655
Ah, wow!

1128
01:00:40.758 --> 01:00:42.241
That was really fun.
Whoo!

1129
01:00:42.310 --> 01:00:43.827
Okay.

1130
01:00:43.931 --> 01:00:47.172
I still cannot believe that you
and your dad used to come here.

1131
01:00:47.275 --> 01:00:49.068
It was actually one
of my favourite things

1132
01:00:49.103 --> 01:00:50.448
to do at Christmas with my dad.

1133
01:00:50.551 --> 01:00:51.689
Yeah?

1134
01:00:51.724 --> 01:00:54.862
Yeah. Just be the two
of us and afterwards,

1135
01:00:54.965 --> 01:00:56.286
you pull out a thermos
with some hot cocoa

1136
01:00:56.310 --> 01:00:59.206
and we'd go over the hill
and sit by the statue.

1137
01:00:59.724 --> 01:01:01.137
I love that statue.

1138
01:01:03.206 --> 01:01:04.482
Remind me who it is again?

1139
01:01:04.862 --> 01:01:05.965
Uh, Charles Owen.

1140
01:01:06.413 --> 01:01:08.000
My dad's favourite author.

1141
01:01:08.034 --> 01:01:09.034
Hmm.

1142
01:01:09.586 --> 01:01:11.872
Yeah, he always used to go over
to the statue for inspiration.

1143
01:01:11.896 --> 01:01:13.724
He'd sit there
and write for hours.

1144
01:01:14.862 --> 01:01:16.310
Your dad was a writer too?

1145
01:01:17.793 --> 01:01:18.793
Aspiring.

1146
01:01:19.517 --> 01:01:20.997
He was always so busy
with the bakery,

1147
01:01:21.034 --> 01:01:24.172
he never really had a chance
to seriously pursue it, but...

1148
01:01:24.931 --> 01:01:27.310
whenever he had a free moment,
this is where he'd be.

1149
01:01:29.344 --> 01:01:32.793
It's... actually his passion
that inspired me

1150
01:01:32.827 --> 01:01:34.034
to become a writer myself.

1151
01:01:37.241 --> 01:01:39.172
Well I'm sure he'd
be very proud of you.

1152
01:01:41.517 --> 01:01:44.172
Yeah, I don't know about that.

1153
01:01:45.172 --> 01:01:47.206
I write top 10s for a living.

1154
01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:49.793
I don't think this is exactly
what he...

1155
01:01:51.965 --> 01:01:53.137
imagined for me.

1156
01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:55.482
Or what I imagined for myself.

1157
01:02:01.620 --> 01:02:03.241
Then write your novel.

1158
01:02:04.862 --> 01:02:06.206
We've been over this.

1159
01:02:07.034 --> 01:02:08.137
I know, I know.

1160
01:02:08.241 --> 01:02:09.931
You need a publisher,
you need an editor.

1161
01:02:09.965 --> 01:02:12.413
And I also have a full-time job
that takes up all of my time.

1162
01:02:12.448 --> 01:02:14.068
You know what
that sounds like?

1163
01:02:14.137 --> 01:02:15.551
A whole lot of excuses.

1164
01:02:16.310 --> 01:02:18.896
If this means something to you,
you need to do it.

1165
01:02:18.965 --> 01:02:20.586
Well, you're one to talk.

1166
01:02:24.413 --> 01:02:26.724
Hey, I tried. She said no.

1167
01:02:26.758 --> 01:02:27.758
Try again.

1168
01:02:28.551 --> 01:02:31.965
You think Evergreen is the only
graphic design firm in New York?

1169
01:02:32.620 --> 01:02:34.562
And do you really want to
spend the rest of your life

1170
01:02:34.586 --> 01:02:36.482
in Pittsburgh,
with a job you hate,

1171
01:02:36.586 --> 01:02:39.689
hoping that one day, your dreams
are just gonna fall on your lap?

1172
01:02:52.103 --> 01:02:53.172
Cara.

1173
01:02:54.137 --> 01:02:56.068
No, you know what,
you're right.

1174
01:02:56.137 --> 01:02:58.448
No, I'm sorry,
I... I overstepped.

1175
01:02:58.551 --> 01:02:59.551
No.

1176
01:03:01.275 --> 01:03:02.620
No more excuses.

1177
01:03:03.034 --> 01:03:05.620
For either of us. Come on.

1178
01:03:07.758 --> 01:03:08.758
Come on!

1179
01:03:17.068 --> 01:03:20.517
Okay, the whole surprise thing
was very cute at first,

1180
01:03:20.620 --> 01:03:23.482
but... can you please
tell me where we're going?

1181
01:03:29.758 --> 01:03:30.758
We're here.

1182
01:03:42.034 --> 01:03:43.448
Hello!

1183
01:03:45.034 --> 01:03:46.241
Mom?

1184
01:03:47.620 --> 01:03:48.862
Is this where you grew up?

1185
01:03:48.965 --> 01:03:50.517
Yeah.

1186
01:03:50.620 --> 01:03:51.448
Wow.

1187
01:03:51.482 --> 01:03:52.586
Festive.

1188
01:04:00.172 --> 01:04:01.517
Come on!

1189
01:04:02.862 --> 01:04:04.000
This way!

1190
01:04:16.896 --> 01:04:18.551
Well, I'm starting
to see where you get

1191
01:04:18.586 --> 01:04:19.517
your Christmas cheer from.

1192
01:04:19.551 --> 01:04:21.172
Oh yeah, we go all out.

1193
01:04:21.206 --> 01:04:22.241
Clearly.

1194
01:04:22.344 --> 01:04:23.586
You'll be needing this.

1195
01:04:23.689 --> 01:04:25.000
Oh.

1196
01:04:25.896 --> 01:04:26.827
Okay.

1197
01:04:26.862 --> 01:04:28.206
Michael.

1198
01:04:28.310 --> 01:04:29.517
Cara.

1199
01:04:29.551 --> 01:04:31.241
Do you remember
when I told you

1200
01:04:31.344 --> 01:04:32.724
about my tradition
with my sister?

1201
01:04:32.758 --> 01:04:35.689
The Christmas wish?
How could I forget?

1202
01:04:35.724 --> 01:04:39.241
Well, it's time for you
to make yours.

1203
01:04:42.103 --> 01:04:43.448
Yeah, I don't know.

1204
01:04:43.551 --> 01:04:45.344
Come on, it's worth a shot,
right?

1205
01:04:45.379 --> 01:04:46.896
And I'm writing mine too.

1206
01:04:46.965 --> 01:04:50.241
Isn't this what you do
with your sister already?

1207
01:04:50.344 --> 01:04:51.769
This year, with the wedding
and everything,

1208
01:04:51.793 --> 01:04:54.689
things have been
a little different.

1209
01:04:55.379 --> 01:04:56.527
You know, it's two days
'till Christmas

1210
01:04:56.551 --> 01:04:58.344
and time's running out.

1211
01:04:58.379 --> 01:04:59.827
Uh...

1212
01:05:01.172 --> 01:05:02.551
For me.

1213
01:05:05.551 --> 01:05:06.620
What do I write?

1214
01:05:08.172 --> 01:05:09.689
What do you mean,
"What do I write?"

1215
01:05:09.793 --> 01:05:10.941
The whole reason
I brought you here

1216
01:05:10.965 --> 01:05:12.620
was so that you could manifest
your novel.

1217
01:05:12.655 --> 01:05:14.044
You've never read any
of my stuff,

1218
01:05:14.068 --> 01:05:15.620
you don't know if I'm any good.

1219
01:05:15.655 --> 01:05:18.241
I have the internet,
I've done my research.

1220
01:05:19.275 --> 01:05:20.172
Okay.

1221
01:05:20.275 --> 01:05:21.655
And it means something to you.

1222
01:05:22.793 --> 01:05:25.068
You know, everyone has
a story to tell and...

1223
01:05:25.965 --> 01:05:28.551
I think people would be lucky
to hear yours.

1224
01:05:35.793 --> 01:05:36.827
Okay.

1225
01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:47.758
Okay. Done. So, what now?

1226
01:05:47.827 --> 01:05:48.827
Pixie dust?

1227
01:05:48.931 --> 01:05:50.931
Do we have to say
a special incantation?

1228
01:05:50.965 --> 01:05:54.482
Very funny.
No, you have to roll it up.

1229
01:05:55.310 --> 01:05:56.241
And then...

1230
01:05:56.275 --> 01:05:58.000
pick one of these.

1231
01:05:58.931 --> 01:05:59.931
Oh.

1232
01:06:02.862 --> 01:06:04.965
It's a great sound.

1233
01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:12.310
Now what?

1234
01:06:12.344 --> 01:06:13.827
Now you hang it on the tree.

1235
01:06:19.827 --> 01:06:20.827
That's it.

1236
01:06:25.344 --> 01:06:26.551
Thank you.

1237
01:06:28.172 --> 01:06:29.655
For bringing me here.

1238
01:06:31.827 --> 01:06:32.827
For everything.

1239
01:06:34.689 --> 01:06:37.000
I have not had a Christmas
this special in a long time.

1240
01:06:39.655 --> 01:06:41.493
I should be thanking you,
this would have been

1241
01:06:41.517 --> 01:06:44.206
a pretty lonely Christmas season
without you.

1242
01:06:45.206 --> 01:06:50.379
And even if we don't find Chace,
it'll be worth it, 'cause I met you.

1243
01:06:55.344 --> 01:06:56.655
Speaking of Chace,

1244
01:06:57.896 --> 01:07:01.000
there's something I have
to tell you. Um...

1245
01:07:02.068 --> 01:07:03.793
Chris, don't forget
the ice cream!

1246
01:07:04.275 --> 01:07:05.310
He's so...

1247
01:07:05.413 --> 01:07:08.275
Oh! Hello, Michael.
Fancy seeing you here.

1248
01:07:08.379 --> 01:07:10.448
Mom, you remember Michael.

1249
01:07:10.551 --> 01:07:12.000
Dad, this is Michael.

1250
01:07:12.965 --> 01:07:13.931
Hi.

1251
01:07:13.965 --> 01:07:15.424
Uh, Cara's helping him
write an article

1252
01:07:15.448 --> 01:07:16.379
about Christmas in New York.

1253
01:07:16.413 --> 01:07:17.965
Ah!

1254
01:07:18.068 --> 01:07:20.044
Well, no-one knows Christmas
better than my little sugar plum.

1255
01:07:20.068 --> 01:07:21.103
Sugar plum?

1256
01:07:22.068 --> 01:07:23.241
Michael!

1257
01:07:23.275 --> 01:07:24.724
Why don't you join
us for dinner?

1258
01:07:24.758 --> 01:07:26.793
Ah, no, I don't want to...
impose on you guys.

1259
01:07:26.896 --> 01:07:30.586
Nonsense! Got enough takeout
to feed an army.

1260
01:07:31.137 --> 01:07:32.137
She's right.

1261
01:07:38.241 --> 01:07:39.241
Are you sure?

1262
01:07:39.344 --> 01:07:40.413
I...

1263
01:07:40.482 --> 01:07:42.206
I'm cool with it
if you're cool with it.

1264
01:07:42.241 --> 01:07:44.517
Yeah, I... I'd love to stay.

1265
01:07:49.379 --> 01:07:50.724
Oh, wow.

1266
01:07:51.724 --> 01:07:53.206
Cara, these are incredible.

1267
01:07:54.448 --> 01:07:55.724
That's a nice thing to say.

1268
01:07:55.758 --> 01:07:56.758
Oh.

1269
01:07:59.448 --> 01:08:01.034
The carollers?
Mmhmm.

1270
01:08:03.103 --> 01:08:05.655
Do you mind if I use this
for the article?

1271
01:08:06.034 --> 01:08:07.586
Yeah, sure.

1272
01:08:08.137 --> 01:08:09.137
Great.

1273
01:08:10.310 --> 01:08:11.517
Come on, you two!

1274
01:08:11.620 --> 01:08:15.068
Okay, I will grab these and...

1275
01:08:15.827 --> 01:08:16.827
After you.

1276
01:08:17.172 --> 01:08:18.172
Thank you.

1277
01:08:21.551 --> 01:08:23.965
Hello! Michael, sit by me.

1278
01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:25.068
Okay! Thanks.

1279
01:08:26.275 --> 01:08:29.482
Wow. This... looks amazing.

1280
01:08:40.827 --> 01:08:43.655
Are we just like...
Let's go in, let's go in.

1281
01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.655
Yes Amy, it's all taken care
of, I promise.

1282
01:08:55.689 --> 01:08:57.286
Okay, I'm just at Pete's,
getting a coffee and then,

1283
01:08:57.310 --> 01:08:59.931
I'm gonna pick up my dress
and then, I will be home.

1284
01:09:00.448 --> 01:09:01.931
Okay. Bye.

1285
01:09:05.689 --> 01:09:08.862
Cara.

1286
01:09:10.586 --> 01:09:12.827
Chace!

1287
01:09:14.103 --> 01:09:14.931
You're here.

1288
01:09:15.034 --> 01:09:16.344
Yes, yeah.

1289
01:09:16.413 --> 01:09:17.413
Wow.

1290
01:09:17.931 --> 01:09:20.586
Uh, I'm so sorry
I didn't call you,

1291
01:09:20.689 --> 01:09:23.034
my phone got kicked
into a sewer and...

1292
01:09:23.068 --> 01:09:26.068
No, it's okay, it's okay.
I figured something happened.

1293
01:09:26.172 --> 01:09:27.862
I found the photo strip.

1294
01:09:27.931 --> 01:09:29.517
Really?

1295
01:09:29.620 --> 01:09:33.000
Yes. Yeah, the ink was smudged, but
I've been looking everywhere for you.

1296
01:09:33.482 --> 01:09:35.103
You have?

1297
01:09:35.206 --> 01:09:38.172
Yeah, I went to all
our places, I even made a list.

1298
01:09:38.689 --> 01:09:40.034
I also made a list.

1299
01:09:40.517 --> 01:09:41.586
Huh.

1300
01:09:47.379 --> 01:09:49.034
What are you doing here?

1301
01:09:49.103 --> 01:09:50.241
Oh, uh...

1302
01:09:50.620 --> 01:09:52.586
I was dropping off some flyers.

1303
01:09:52.689 --> 01:09:54.424
There's a violinist playing
a charity concert

1304
01:09:54.448 --> 01:09:56.206
at the Christmas
tree lot tonight.

1305
01:09:56.241 --> 01:09:58.689
So, here I am.

1306
01:09:59.586 --> 01:10:00.586
Here you are.

1307
01:10:00.655 --> 01:10:01.931
Wow.

1308
01:10:02.034 --> 01:10:03.137
This is...

1309
01:10:03.172 --> 01:10:05.551
I can't believe we finally
found each other.

1310
01:10:05.586 --> 01:10:08.034
You know, I even left my number
here, hoping you'd stop by.

1311
01:10:08.103 --> 01:10:09.689
Really? I wonder why Pete
didn't...

1312
01:10:10.103 --> 01:10:11.482
Uh, hey, Pete?

1313
01:10:11.517 --> 01:10:12.827
Cara! Hi.

1314
01:10:12.862 --> 01:10:14.034
Hi!

1315
01:10:14.103 --> 01:10:15.206
And who is this?

1316
01:10:15.275 --> 01:10:16.275
This is Chace.

1317
01:10:17.448 --> 01:10:19.517
He said he left
his number for me.

1318
01:10:20.103 --> 01:10:24.344
Oh, yes, right! I thought
I recognized you.

1319
01:10:24.379 --> 01:10:25.379
Yeah...

1320
01:10:26.724 --> 01:10:29.034
Right. So, why didn't you
give it to me?

1321
01:10:31.034 --> 01:10:32.034
I...

1322
01:10:33.862 --> 01:10:35.827
Well...

1323
01:10:38.896 --> 01:10:40.344
Pete?

1324
01:10:40.931 --> 01:10:44.000
Okay, I gave it to Michael.

1325
01:10:44.862 --> 01:10:47.310
Sorry, who's Michael?

1326
01:10:50.689 --> 01:10:53.586
He's, um... no-one.

1327
01:10:53.689 --> 01:10:59.137
Uh... Anyway, you're here now
and this is so wild.

1328
01:10:59.517 --> 01:11:01.000
Yeah.

1329
01:11:01.517 --> 01:11:03.137
You know, I wish
I could stick around

1330
01:11:03.172 --> 01:11:07.137
and have a coffee with you,
but I gotta get to my nephew.

1331
01:11:08.793 --> 01:11:10.862
If you're free tonight,
would you want to meet me

1332
01:11:10.965 --> 01:11:12.931
at the Christmas tree lot
for the concert?

1333
01:11:14.137 --> 01:11:15.620
I would love to.

1334
01:11:16.413 --> 01:11:18.241
Okay. Great, uh...

1335
01:11:18.931 --> 01:11:20.448
We should probably exchange
numbers.

1336
01:11:21.482 --> 01:11:22.724
I'll take yours this time.

1337
01:11:23.724 --> 01:11:24.896
There you go.

1338
01:11:35.620 --> 01:11:37.310
So...

1339
01:11:38.310 --> 01:11:40.310
Do you like it?

1340
01:11:40.413 --> 01:11:42.034
Do I like it?

1341
01:11:45.103 --> 01:11:46.620
I love it.

1342
01:11:47.275 --> 01:11:48.275
Oh!

1343
01:11:49.413 --> 01:11:50.965
Great.

1344
01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.965
You've completely captured the
magic of Christmas in New York.

1345
01:11:55.448 --> 01:11:58.310
It just really, it makes me
think of my childhood.

1346
01:11:59.620 --> 01:12:01.137
And I didn't even grow up here.

1347
01:12:03.758 --> 01:12:06.689
Phil, I don't even know what
to say. Um...

1348
01:12:09.448 --> 01:12:10.896
You're fired.

1349
01:12:13.310 --> 01:12:14.310
I'm sorry, what?

1350
01:12:14.655 --> 01:12:16.655
You and I both know that

1351
01:12:16.689 --> 01:12:18.172
you're too good for this job.

1352
01:12:19.517 --> 01:12:20.862
This article confirms that.

1353
01:12:21.379 --> 01:12:24.413
But if no-one's pushing you,
you'll never achieve

1354
01:12:24.517 --> 01:12:25.862
your full potential.

1355
01:12:26.620 --> 01:12:30.000
So, here's me pushing you.

1356
01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.689
Well, I appreciate
your confidence in me.

1357
01:12:34.793 --> 01:12:36.000
Phil, I do.

1358
01:12:37.172 --> 01:12:38.206
I need a job.

1359
01:12:39.689 --> 01:12:40.482
What am I gonna do?

1360
01:12:40.551 --> 01:12:41.827
You're gonna write!

1361
01:12:42.310 --> 01:12:46.000
I have a friend in publishing
who I think you should meet.

1362
01:12:46.827 --> 01:12:49.172
Expect a call from him
sometime this week.

1363
01:12:53.517 --> 01:12:54.724
Thank you.

1364
01:12:55.862 --> 01:12:57.689
I don't even know what to say.

1365
01:12:58.517 --> 01:13:00.206
Merry Christmas, Michael.

1366
01:13:02.482 --> 01:13:03.758
Merry Christmas, Phil.

1367
01:13:27.344 --> 01:13:28.344
Coming!

1368
01:13:33.551 --> 01:13:34.551
Michael.

1369
01:13:35.896 --> 01:13:37.034
What are you doing here?

1370
01:13:37.896 --> 01:13:39.793
I got fired.

1371
01:13:40.896 --> 01:13:41.724
I'm sorry to hear.

1372
01:13:41.793 --> 01:13:43.896
No, it is a good thing.

1373
01:13:45.068 --> 01:13:47.551
My boss wants me to go
and write my novel.

1374
01:13:47.965 --> 01:13:49.379
It's great news, Michael.

1375
01:13:51.310 --> 01:13:52.310
Congratulations.

1376
01:13:53.793 --> 01:13:54.965
Is everything okay?

1377
01:13:58.241 --> 01:14:01.068
Actually, I have news
of my own.

1378
01:14:01.827 --> 01:14:02.620
Oh yeah?

1379
01:14:02.655 --> 01:14:04.241
Yeah.

1380
01:14:04.344 --> 01:14:08.241
I went to Pete's today and you'll
never guess who I ran into.

1381
01:14:10.241 --> 01:14:11.241
Chace.

1382
01:14:13.379 --> 01:14:14.620
I ran into Chace.

1383
01:14:16.448 --> 01:14:17.448
Oh.

1384
01:14:19.275 --> 01:14:20.551
Yeah.

1385
01:14:20.655 --> 01:14:23.482
Cara, uh... I can explain.

1386
01:14:23.551 --> 01:14:25.034
Okay, I would love to hear it.

1387
01:14:25.137 --> 01:14:28.448
Well... Pete only
gave it to me a few days ago.

1388
01:14:28.482 --> 01:14:30.620
A few days ago?

1389
01:14:30.655 --> 01:14:32.275
I meant to give it to you.

1390
01:14:32.310 --> 01:14:33.344
But you didn't.

1391
01:14:33.379 --> 01:14:35.862
You kept it from me
and you lied to me.

1392
01:14:37.896 --> 01:14:40.034
No, I... always meant
to give you the number,

1393
01:14:40.137 --> 01:14:41.448
it's just...

1394
01:14:43.551 --> 01:14:46.689
I started to feel that...

1395
01:14:46.793 --> 01:14:48.137
Feel what?

1396
01:14:49.862 --> 01:14:51.965
There was something happening
between us.

1397
01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:00.413
I'm so sorry, I...

1398
01:15:01.034 --> 01:15:02.379
I made a mistake.

1399
01:15:04.068 --> 01:15:05.724
I tried to give you the number
and I'm...

1400
01:15:05.758 --> 01:15:08.586
You didn't try hard enough,
you should have said something.

1401
01:15:09.896 --> 01:15:11.172
You know, now it's too late.

1402
01:15:12.448 --> 01:15:14.148
We spent the last week
running around the city,

1403
01:15:14.172 --> 01:15:17.206
hoping to find your soulmate.
Mmhmm.

1404
01:15:17.241 --> 01:15:20.379
So, forgive me if it never
quite felt like the right time.

1405
01:15:20.413 --> 01:15:23.344
And to be honest,
I wasn't sure how you felt...

1406
01:15:25.103 --> 01:15:26.517
but obviously, I was wrong.

1407
01:15:29.862 --> 01:15:31.586
What if I...

1408
01:15:37.344 --> 01:15:39.172
What if you what?

1409
01:15:43.379 --> 01:15:46.172
It doesn't matter now
because I can't trust you.

1410
01:15:47.931 --> 01:15:49.344
So, there's no way...

1411
01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:53.517
you can give me another chance?

1412
01:15:55.344 --> 01:15:56.344
Cara...

1413
01:15:58.344 --> 01:15:59.689
Merry Christmas, Michael.

1414
01:16:34.103 --> 01:16:35.413
And what did I see?

1415
01:16:35.448 --> 01:16:37.758
There it is, a picture of you,
just sitting there.

1416
01:16:39.172 --> 01:16:40.620
I couldn't believe my eyes.

1417
01:16:40.689 --> 01:16:43.482
I honestly cannot believe
that it actually worked.

1418
01:16:43.586 --> 01:16:46.827
Michael was so sure
that you would not find it,

1419
01:16:46.931 --> 01:16:48.655
but I knew deep down
that you would.

1420
01:16:49.103 --> 01:16:51.241
Right, uh... And Michael,

1421
01:16:51.275 --> 01:16:52.931
I'm assuming is the guy
in the photo?

1422
01:16:52.965 --> 01:16:53.827
Yeah.

1423
01:16:53.931 --> 01:16:55.241
But he's out of the picture now.

1424
01:16:55.275 --> 01:16:57.620
Oh, I didn't realize
that you two...

1425
01:16:57.724 --> 01:16:59.206
No, we aren't.

1426
01:16:59.586 --> 01:17:00.965
We weren't.

1427
01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:03.482
Okay, got you.

1428
01:17:07.517 --> 01:17:10.413
But enough about him,
I want to hear more about you,

1429
01:17:10.517 --> 01:17:12.689
how has your trip home
been so far?

1430
01:17:12.724 --> 01:17:15.655
Yeah, it's been great.
I've been going around town

1431
01:17:15.689 --> 01:17:19.827
with my nephew, Gregory, showing
him a real, New York Christmas.

1432
01:17:20.965 --> 01:17:22.827
We've been hitting
all the spots.

1433
01:17:22.862 --> 01:17:27.000
He doesn't know all the places,
so I've been taking him around,

1434
01:17:27.034 --> 01:17:28.586
I've been...

1435
01:17:28.689 --> 01:17:30.827
We ran into a real-life
abominable snowman...

1436
01:17:52.137 --> 01:17:53.172
Thanks.

1437
01:17:54.689 --> 01:17:58.103
Oh... Michael, I'm so sorry.

1438
01:17:59.344 --> 01:18:01.862
No, don't apologize,
it's not your fault.

1439
01:18:01.896 --> 01:18:03.206
But it is.

1440
01:18:03.241 --> 01:18:07.689
She caught me on the spot,
I wasn't thinking,

1441
01:18:07.724 --> 01:18:09.517
it just came out.
Pete.

1442
01:18:10.758 --> 01:18:12.758
It's okay. Okay?

1443
01:18:15.068 --> 01:18:16.896
You gave me the number
to give to her and...

1444
01:18:18.241 --> 01:18:19.517
the rest is on me.

1445
01:18:21.034 --> 01:18:22.034
So, what happened?

1446
01:18:22.413 --> 01:18:24.034
She says she can't trust me.

1447
01:18:24.482 --> 01:18:27.448
She's probably on a date
with Chace right now.

1448
01:18:28.068 --> 01:18:30.724
So what?
You're just gonna give up?

1449
01:18:30.758 --> 01:18:32.137
Give up on what?

1450
01:18:32.241 --> 01:18:36.206
On Cara. There's obviously
something between you.

1451
01:18:36.241 --> 01:18:37.448
Something special.

1452
01:18:37.931 --> 01:18:41.206
She brought out a part of you
that I haven't seen in years.

1453
01:18:42.620 --> 01:18:44.820
I'm not gonna stand by and
watch you walk away from that.

1454
01:18:48.551 --> 01:18:50.241
What am I supposed to do, man?

1455
01:18:51.379 --> 01:18:53.068
Can't force her
to want to be with me.

1456
01:18:57.310 --> 01:18:58.551
Oh, and I got fired.

1457
01:18:58.965 --> 01:19:00.137
What?

1458
01:19:00.965 --> 01:19:02.241
Yeah.

1459
01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:05.000
Michael.

1460
01:19:06.862 --> 01:19:07.931
We need to talk.

1461
01:19:07.965 --> 01:19:10.034
Turns out that Michael

1462
01:19:10.137 --> 01:19:15.965
is this incredible pastry chef and we made
the entire three-tier cake from scratch.

1463
01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:17.931
Wow!

1464
01:19:17.965 --> 01:19:19.551
Wow, that...
Yeah.

1465
01:19:19.655 --> 01:19:21.482
- That's very impressive.
- Yeah.

1466
01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:24.965
Uh.

1467
01:19:34.344 --> 01:19:36.137
I had a really great time
tonight.

1468
01:19:36.206 --> 01:19:37.689
Me too.

1469
01:19:38.379 --> 01:19:40.310
So, about the wedding,
I was thinking that...

1470
01:19:40.344 --> 01:19:42.931
Look, Cara, I really like you.

1471
01:19:43.551 --> 01:19:46.448
You're great and we have
so much in common and...

1472
01:19:47.655 --> 01:19:51.344
I think if the timing
was different, maybe...

1473
01:19:52.827 --> 01:19:54.862
you could have been
something great, but...

1474
01:19:55.724 --> 01:19:59.413
it's clear to me that this
isn't working out.

1475
01:20:03.517 --> 01:20:04.517
Okay.

1476
01:20:05.793 --> 01:20:06.965
Why?

1477
01:20:09.793 --> 01:20:11.172
I think you know why.

1478
01:20:35.206 --> 01:20:36.655
How's it going back there?

1479
01:20:37.448 --> 01:20:38.448
You get tangled up again?

1480
01:20:38.482 --> 01:20:40.482
I'm almost ready,
just one second.

1481
01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:56.000
Ta-da!

1482
01:20:57.862 --> 01:20:58.620
Wow!

1483
01:20:58.689 --> 01:21:00.310
What's wrong?

1484
01:21:01.310 --> 01:21:04.103
You just... You look so
beautiful.

1485
01:21:05.551 --> 01:21:07.355
Okay, that's a nice try,
but you were emotional

1486
01:21:07.379 --> 01:21:08.655
before I even came out here.

1487
01:21:09.034 --> 01:21:10.034
What happened?

1488
01:21:10.862 --> 01:21:11.862
Hm.

1489
01:21:15.551 --> 01:21:17.758
"Hi, again, Phoebe,
I just wanted to follow up

1490
01:21:17.862 --> 01:21:20.517
with some of Cara Martin's
additional materials.

1491
01:21:21.206 --> 01:21:23.275
While I respect
your initial decision,

1492
01:21:23.379 --> 01:21:26.379
it is my hope that these designs
will help you see

1493
01:21:26.448 --> 01:21:29.344
what a brilliant talent
she is and give her a chance.

1494
01:21:29.862 --> 01:21:33.241
I can personally attest
to her passion

1495
01:21:33.344 --> 01:21:36.275
and determination,
and am confident she would make

1496
01:21:36.379 --> 01:21:38.103
a valuable addition
to your team.

1497
01:21:38.206 --> 01:21:40.827
Best, Michael."

1498
01:21:43.034 --> 01:21:44.655
She wants to meet
in the new year.

1499
01:21:45.241 --> 01:21:46.527
She thinks I have
a lot of potential.

1500
01:21:46.551 --> 01:21:48.379
Cara! This is amazing!

1501
01:21:48.413 --> 01:21:53.379
Yeah, um, I just don't even understand
how he got the wedding mockups.

1502
01:21:54.689 --> 01:21:55.689
Um...

1503
01:21:56.206 --> 01:21:58.862
Yeah, I might have had a little
something to do with that.

1504
01:21:59.379 --> 01:22:01.034
What was I supposed to do, okay?

1505
01:22:01.068 --> 01:22:03.793
Pass up the opportunity to help
my sister fulfill her dream

1506
01:22:03.827 --> 01:22:05.862
and potentially move back
to the city?

1507
01:22:05.965 --> 01:22:08.827
Not to mention make
her Christmas wish come true?

1508
01:22:09.275 --> 01:22:11.275
You know, things didn't
work out with Chace.

1509
01:22:12.655 --> 01:22:14.413
I'm not talking about Chace.

1510
01:22:16.655 --> 01:22:18.620
Doesn't make any sense,
though. It's...

1511
01:22:18.655 --> 01:22:20.620
- You're polar opposites.
- Yeah.

1512
01:22:22.344 --> 01:22:25.413
I think sometimes, your soulmate
is the person you least expect.

1513
01:22:29.068 --> 01:22:31.827
He lied to me, though.
I can't trust him anymore.

1514
01:22:31.931 --> 01:22:34.448
He told me that he tried
to give you Chace's number.

1515
01:22:34.517 --> 01:22:36.389
I really think his heart
was in the right place.

1516
01:22:36.413 --> 01:22:38.758
I mean, some love stories
are just complicated.

1517
01:22:42.758 --> 01:22:43.896
Enough about me!

1518
01:22:43.931 --> 01:22:45.724
This is your day!

1519
01:22:46.586 --> 01:22:48.424
Ooh, okay, but I'm dropping
this just for now,

1520
01:22:48.448 --> 01:22:49.758
because it's not over, okay?

1521
01:22:52.241 --> 01:22:53.551
Oh!

1522
01:22:55.586 --> 01:22:56.655
Wow.

1523
01:23:00.344 --> 01:23:02.034
You do look beautiful.

1524
01:23:02.551 --> 01:23:03.862
I kind of do, don't I?

1525
01:23:03.965 --> 01:23:04.965
Yeah!

1526
01:23:05.413 --> 01:23:06.862
Wow, the veil.

1527
01:23:07.379 --> 01:23:08.379
It's almost time.

1528
01:23:08.482 --> 01:23:09.827
Okay, I'll meet you
down there.

1529
01:23:40.206 --> 01:23:41.517
Hi.

1530
01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:43.000
Hi.

1531
01:23:48.172 --> 01:23:49.137
Look, Michael, I...

1532
01:23:49.172 --> 01:23:50.412
Before you say anything else,

1533
01:23:50.827 --> 01:23:53.482
I need to apologize
to you again.

1534
01:23:56.413 --> 01:23:57.613
Amy invited me to the wedding,

1535
01:23:57.689 --> 01:23:59.241
but if you don't want me
to be here...

1536
01:23:59.344 --> 01:24:01.068
No, no, no, I want you
to be here.

1537
01:24:01.758 --> 01:24:04.379
And I should be apologizing too,
I was so caught up

1538
01:24:04.413 --> 01:24:08.379
in finding some guy I barely
knew that I completely missed

1539
01:24:08.413 --> 01:24:09.896
what was right in front of me.

1540
01:24:18.965 --> 01:24:20.448
Oh, you two made up!
That's great.

1541
01:24:20.551 --> 01:24:21.379
You should...

1542
01:24:21.413 --> 01:24:22.241
Yeah, I'm gonna go.

1543
01:24:22.275 --> 01:24:23.275
Yeah, yeah.

1544
01:24:23.379 --> 01:24:24.724
Okay! Okay.

1545
01:24:24.758 --> 01:24:26.413
Wow.
Ooh, it's all happening.

1546
01:24:31.689 --> 01:24:33.379
I love you.
I love you.

1547
01:25:31.172 --> 01:25:34.931
Amy, I love you so much.

1548
01:25:38.137 --> 01:25:39.655
That's only because

1549
01:25:39.724 --> 01:25:43.758
I could not have imagined
somebody so kind,

1550
01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:46.000
so caring,

1551
01:25:46.379 --> 01:25:48.517
so handsome...

1552
01:25:48.620 --> 01:25:50.517
and so generous as you.

1553
01:26:45.310 --> 01:26:46.344
So?

1554
01:26:46.896 --> 01:26:49.689
Big interview coming up.
Mmhmm.

1555
01:26:49.724 --> 01:26:51.137
You nervous?

1556
01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:54.931
A little. It's only
my dream job, so...

1557
01:26:55.586 --> 01:26:58.206
You know, trying to manage
expectations.

1558
01:27:01.827 --> 01:27:03.586
But it seems like
your Christmas wish

1559
01:27:03.620 --> 01:27:05.413
is already coming true, so...

1560
01:27:05.482 --> 01:27:06.724
Hmm...

1561
01:27:07.896 --> 01:27:09.827
How are you so sure you know
what I wished for?

1562
01:27:18.827 --> 01:27:21.000
You mean to tell me
that you didn't wish

1563
01:27:21.103 --> 01:27:22.758
for your novel to get published?

1564
01:27:23.448 --> 01:27:25.068
That is exactly
what I'm saying.

1565
01:27:27.310 --> 01:27:28.655
Then what did you wish for?

1566
01:28:14.344 --> 01:28:16.137
Can I? One, two, three!

1567
01:28:16.172 --> 01:28:18.517
Oh my gosh, you're kidding!

1568
01:28:18.551 --> 01:28:19.793
There's no way you made this!

1569
01:28:19.827 --> 01:28:21.206
Well, I had a little help.

1570
01:28:21.310 --> 01:28:22.482
It's beautiful!

1571
01:28:22.896 --> 01:28:24.103
I love it so much.

1572
01:28:25.241 --> 01:28:26.413
Alright.

1573
01:28:33.172 --> 01:28:34.862
Cheers!

1574
01:28:35.379 --> 01:28:38.344
- To the happy couple.
- To the happy couple.

1575
01:28:38.379 --> 01:28:39.448
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

1576
01:28:49.827 --> 01:28:52.275
